                "content": "Photos and videos of sharks and other marine life swimming in suburban floodwaters make for popular hoaxes during massive storms. But a cellphone video filmed during Hurricane Ian's assault on southwest Florida isn't just another fish story. The eye-popping video, which showed a large, dark fish with sharp dorsal fins thrashing around an inundated Fort Myers backyard, racked up more than 12 million views on Twitter within a day, as users responded with disbelief and comparisons to the \"Sharknado\" film series. Dominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer, confirmed he filmed the clip from his back patio Wednesday morning when he saw something \"flopping around\" in his neighbor's flooded yard. \"I didn't know what it was -- it just looked like a fish or something,\" he told The Associated Press. \"I zoomed in, and all my friends are like, 'It's like a shark, man!'\" He guessed the fish was about four feet (1.2 metres) in length. Experts were of mixed opinion on whether the clip showed a shark or another large fish. George Burgess, former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History's shark program, said in an email that it \"appears to be a juvenile shark,\" while Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, director of the University of Miami's shark conservation program, wrote that \"it's pretty hard to tell.\" Nevertheless, some Twitter users dubbed the hapless fish the \"street shark.\" The surge worsened in Fort Myers as the day went on. Cameratta said the flooding had only just begun when the clip was taken, but that the waters were \"all the way up to our house\" by the time the AP reached him by phone Wednesday evening. He said the fish may have made its way up from nearby Hendry Creek into a retention pond, which then overflowed, spilling the creature into his neighbor's backyard. A visual analysis of nearby property confirmed it matches the physical landmarks in the video. Leslie Guelcher, a professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, was among the online sleuths who initially thought the video was fake. \"Don't think this is real. According to the index on the video it was created in June 2010. Someone else posted it at 10 AM as in Fort Myers, but the storm surge wasn't like that at 10 AM,\" she tweeted Wednesday. Guelcher acknowledged later, though, that online tools she and others were using to establish the video's origins didn't actually show when the video itself was created, merely when the social media profile of the user was created. The AP confirmed through the original clip's metadata that it was captured Wednesday morning. \"It makes a bit more sense from a flooding standpoint,\" she said by email, when informed the fish was spotted near an overflowing pond. \"But how on earth would a shark go from the Gulf of Mexico to a retention pond?\" Yannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, said that most sharks flee shallow bays ahead of hurricanes, possibly tipped off to their arrival by a change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he said, or been washed into it. \"Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters -- rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments -- and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,\" Burgess said. \"Assuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.\" Cameratta sent the video to a group chat on WhatsApp on Wednesday morning, according to his friend John Paul Murray, who sent the AP a timestamped screenshot. \"Amazing content,\" Murray wrote in reply. ------ Associated Press writers Philip Marcelo and Arijeta Lajka in New York contributed to this report.

                "content": "Hurricane Shark and Street Shark are nicknames for several claimed instances of a live shark swimming in a flooded urban area, typically in the aftermath of a hurricane. For more than a decade (starting with Hurricane Irene in 2011), all media purporting to document such claims—most notably an image of a shark swimming on a flooded freeway—were debunked as fabrications. However, during Hurricane Ian in 2022, the Associated Press verified a video taken by Dominic Cameratta of a shark or other large fish swimming in flooded Fort Myers, Florida; one consulted expert concluded that the fish was \"a juvenile shark\" while another was unable to determine whether it was a shark.[1] Both the re-emergence of the hoax in hurricane after hurricane and the eventual appearance of a plausible claim have been the subject of commentary and amusement; Daniel Victor of The New York Times described the Associated Press's findings as \"like discovering Bigfoot is real\".[2] The original \"Hurricane Shark\" image was created during Hurricane Irene in 2011, with a claim that the shark was on a street in Puerto Rico.[2] According to The Washington Post, it likely originated on Reddit.[3] In the aftermath of the hurricane, the image was aired by Miami Fox affiliate WSVN,[3] was posted by the Miami Herald, and was widely shared on social media websites including Twitter.[4] The image was debunked by the Post,[3] Snopes.com,[5] and the Toronto Star.[4] It had been created by combining an image of a flooded street in Puerto Rico with a photo of a shark taken by Thomas P. Peschak off of South Africa in 2003.[4] The Post compared it to similar hoax images, such as one supposedly of Osama bin Laden's body following his death.[3] Craig Silverman, writing in the Star, cast it as part of a larger phenomenon of hoax images appearing in the aftermath of significant events.[4] The image has frequently resurfaced on the internet with claims that it was taken during various flooding events,[2] including in Houston during both the 2015 Texas–Oklahoma flood and tornado outbreak and the 2017 floods caused by Hurricane Harvey, and in Daytona Beach, Florida, in 2016 during floods caused by Hurricane Matthew.[5] Peschak has said his fans notify him each time the image re-emerges, but that \"they're more outraged than I am\".[6] After Toronto's Union Station flooded in June 2012, a manipulated image circulated purporting to show two sharks at the base of an escalator bank. The image was later reused in a hoax claiming that a shark tank had burst at the Kuwait Scientific Center.[7][8] While the flooding in Toronto was not the result of a hurricane, the hoax has often been compared to the main Hurricane Shark hoax.[2][9] Later in 2012, after Hurricane Sandy struck New Jersey, other fake shark images circulated in addition to the better-known freeway one. One image appears to depict a shark outside of a home in a suburban area.[10][11] Another appears to show a shark swimming down a suburban street.[12][13] Tom Phillips and Alexis Madrigal found the real shark image used to create the former; Snopes did the same for the latter.[10][13][11] During both Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Florence, fake television breaking news screen captures were seen online saying that the hurricane \"now contains sharks\", although neither contained images of sharks.[14] No, Hurricane Florence does not contain sharks September 13, 2018[15] Hurricane sharks as hoaxes have taken on a life of their own, in social media and in the press. Doctored photos of sharks swimming in urban areas went viral on social media in virtually every disastrous storm and hurricane in the decade since, often copies of the image that first circulated during Irene.[15] Some on social media have treated the Hurricane Shark as a meme, an in-joke hoax to be revived with each disaster, while others have genuinely believed in the authenticity of the photos being spread.[2] Commentators have made comparisons to Sharknado, a film series that also involves sharks caught up in natural disasters.[16][1] In response to the \"now contains sharks\" images circulated during Hurricane Florence, FEMA's Associate Director of Office of Response and Recovery, Jeffrey Byard, denied that \"there's a sharknado effect or anything like that\".[14] Because of the recurring nature of the meme, fact-checkers and journalists in the media have repeatedly needed to clarify that the images of Hurricane sharks were hoaxes. According to Daniel Victor, writing for The New York Times in 2022, Hurricane Shark is the \"longtime nemesis\" of fact-checkers on social media.[2] In Silverman's Verification Handbook, Phillips makes a case study of his work with Madrigal during Hurricane Sandy, describing the images they reviewed as \"strange enough to make you suspicious, yet [not] implausible enough to dismiss out of hand\".[10][13] Rose Eveleth, in a 2014 piece for BBC Future about how to spot fake Sandy photos, includes as her list's final item, \"If it has a shark in it, it's probably fake\".[9] An early claim of sharks in a flooded urban area, predating the original Hurricane Shark hoax, occurred in Goodna, Queensland, Australia, amidst major flooding in January 2011.[4] Butcher Steve Bateman reported a shark, roughly 6 feet (1.8 m) in length, swimming past his shop, and several others reported seeing a shark on a different street.[17] Two local politicians vouched for Bateman's credibility, and The Queensland Times noted that sharks are known to swim up the Bremer River to Goodna.[18] In September 2022, after Hurricane Ian struck Florida, a video emerged online of a shark in a flooded backyard in Fort Myers, Florida, drawing over 12 million views within a day.[1] Initially, the video received skepticism from journalists and fact-checkers, wary of the long history of similar media being hoaxes while also noting that the video seemed more authentic than previous renditions.[2] On September 29, the Associated Press, while noting the history of the Hurricane Shark, confirmed the authenticity of the video based on analysis of the video's metadata and an interview with the videographer, Dominic Cameratta. The Associated Press consulted shark experts George H. Burgess and ... [Content truncated]",

                "content": "It happens every time there’s a hurricane – the shark photos, memes, and old videos showing ‘proof’ that a shark (usually one that looks like a great white) is taking advantage of flooded streets and malls to search for… well, who knows what. For years both journalists and shark scientists have had to put up with the deluge of fake images and videos, telling the public the same message: “this is fake.” In fact, even the Twitter page for Snopes has begged people to stop sharing the proven false photos and videos. So, it was to no one’s surprise when a video popped up after Hurricane Ian made landfall in Florida claiming to capture a shark in floodwaters.\nThis video, however, was different.\n“I didn’t know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,” Cameratta told news outlets. ... [+] “I zoomed in, and all my friends are like: ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nPast hoax videos usually showed sharks in flooded malls or swimming down highways, but this one seemed to be in someone’s backyard near Fort Myers, Florida. The fact that this was a new video garnered a lot of attention, racking up millions of views on Twitter. The skepticism was rampant – and warranted. The first question many asked was, “Is this an actual video?” An answer quickly came with both Storyful and The Associated Press confirming its authenticity through examination of the video’s metadata and subsequent interviews. AP got the scoop from local real estate agent Dominic Cameratta, who confirmed he filmed the clip himself on Wednesday morning. “I didn’t know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,” he told news outlets. “I zoomed in, and all my friends are like: ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nSo, the clip is real. But is that really a shark?\nIt’s hard to tell – and even shark scientists are stumped. George Burgess, a former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark program, told the Washington Post that the fish in the video appears to be a juvenile shark. “Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters — rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments — and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,” Burgess said. “Assuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.”\n“Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters — rivers, estuaries, subtropical ... [+] embayments — and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,” Burgess says.\nDr. Yannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, is on the fence about the video. Papastamatiou pointed to the science that shows many shark species are known to flee shallow, coastal regions ahead of hurricanes, possibly being tipped off to the giant storm’s arrival by a drastic change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he reckons, or been washed into it.\nBut Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami’s shark conservation program, isn’t as convinced, saying it was difficult to tell what exactly the fish was. It should be of note that the video caught the fish swimming near a pond that was overflowing, causing some experts to lean towards this just being an escapee.\nIt seems we will never have a definitive answer to this mystery. While shark experts are split over the identification, some Twitter users were convinced and have dubbed the grainy fish a “street shark.” Perhaps this is a new rendition for “Baby Shark” writers to pick up and write a song about?\n\nOne Community.

A local NBC affiliate reporter posted a video on Thursday showing an alligator swimming through floodwaters in Lake County, saying it looked like it was \"about 9, 10 feet.\" The local fire chief had earlier warned about animals in the floodwaters, she said, adding that the creatures normally wouldn't like to \"come out of the swamps.\" \nOne viral video shows a mystery creature swimming through a flooded neighborhood in Fort Myers on Wednesday morning. Many suspect the animal – which appears to have fins – was a small shark. Though CBS has not confirmed the authenticity of the video, video licensing agency Storyful said it confirmed the video's authenticity and spoke to local marine and wildlife specialists, who were more skeptical that the creature was a shark. \nFlorida officials are warning people to stay out of floodwaters left by Hurricane Ian. And one person in Fort Myers happened to capture a really good reason why – a mystery creature swimming through their flooded neighborhood. https://t.co/InUuwf3cCm pic.twitter.com/vCsZrhF0wf\nOne expert from Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said staff couldn't identify the animal. Marine scientist Rick Bartleson was also unsure, Storyful said, but said that based on the shape of the animal's dorsal fin, he doubts it was a shark or sawfish. \nBut one thing is known for sure – it's just one more reason to avoid the floodwaters. \nFlorida Fish and Wildlife officials said Tuesday that \"major storms cause wildlife to become more active.\" \n\"You may be more likely to see alligators, snakes and bears, so remember to stay alert and give them space,\" the department said in a Facebook post. It advised anyone who comes across wild animals to report it to the department. \nMuch of the state saw significant flooding, and some areas expected record-breaking water levels, even inland. \n\"The amount of water that's been rising, and will likely continue to rise today even as the storm is passing, is basically a 500-year flood event,\" Governor Ron DeSantis said Thursday morning. \"...Some of the flooding you're gonna see in areas hundreds of miles from where this made landfall are gonna set records.\" \nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis says there will be major flooding \"hundreds of miles\" from where Hurricane Ian made landfall. \"The amount of water that’s been rising…is basically a 500-year flood event.\" pic.twitter.com/vSwNqxuuck\nFloodwaters can increase the risk of drowning, and Florida's Division of Emergency Management has warned that the water can be contaminated and be filled with dangerous debris. Underground or fallen power lines, which have been reported throughout the state in Ian's wake, can electrically charge the water — a potentially fatal hazard.\nEmergency officials also urged people to not drive through flooded roadways, noting that \"nearly half of all people killed in floods are those who try driving through flooded areas.\" Don't drive around barricades, and if your vehicle stalls, they recommend leaving it immediately. \nFor areas hardest-hit by storm damage and flooding, the division's director Kevin Guthrie has repeatedly warned that it could be difficult for first responders to get to the scene of an emergency, depending on the level of destruction. \n\"Please keep in mind that first responders may not be able to immediately enter impacted areas to assist you due to the safety hazards,\" he said Wednesday evening. \nLi Cohen is a senior social media producer at CBS News.
