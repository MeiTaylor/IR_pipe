Florida just outta control right now üò≥ü¶≠ pic.twitter.com/LSJMf3bnIt The video, posted to Twitter on Sept. 28, had more than 12 million views. No, an elephant seal was not seen scooting along a Florida sidewalk during Hurricane Ian. The elephant seal video was taken in October 2020 in Puerto Cisnes, Chile. According to Infobae, an Argentinian news outlet, the elephant seal traveled 10 blocks in an area known as the largest urban center in the city of Puerto Cisnes, Chile. With the help of residents in the area, the seal was transported back to the ocean by the Chilean navy. The rescue mission was recorded live on Facebook in October 2020 by a local radio DJ.

When a hurricane hits Florida people do a party pic.twitter.com/B4Vaas2SFD The video clip, shared by multiple accounts on Sept. 28, had hundreds of thousands of views on Twitter. It had more than 1 million likes on TikTok. No, the video wasn‚Äôt taken during Ian. It was shared online multiple times before the storm made landfall in Florida, though it was taken in Fort Myers, Florida. Using RevEye, a reverse image search tool, VERIFY found several instances where the video was shared prior to Ian becoming a named storm. The video was posted on Reddit on Aug. 30. This 12-second video was posted to Facebook on Sept. 12. It was also posted on Imgur, an image and video sharing platform, on Sept. 15, about a week and a half before Ian made landfall. Using Google Maps Streetview, VERIFY was able to pinpoint the exact location where the video was taken ‚Äì from the rooftop of the Lani Kai Island Resort in Fort Myers Beach. The same buildings seen in the video can be seen from Google Maps. The same 7-11 convenience store can be seen across the street from the Lani Kai resort where the video was taken, and right across the street from that, the same blue building. Does this photo show a shark swimming on a Florida highway in Ian‚Äôs floodwaters? There are sharks on the highways in Florida. Unreal. pic.twitter.com/sHcgfkrc8o The photo, posted to Twitter on Sept. 28, had more than 28,000 retweets and over 300,000 likes. This photo circulates nearly each hurricane season. This example was shared in 2018 in connection to Hurricane Florence, which wreaked havoc on the Carolinas. Here it was shared during Hurricane Sandy, and here during Hurricane Irma. The image was actually lifted from a September 2005 issue of Africa Geographic. The original photo shows a shark trailing a kayaker, and was later manipulated to look like a shark was swimming through an interstate lane.

Flamingos evacuated to the bathroom at Sunken Gardens, St Pete.ü¶©ü¶© #hurricaneian pic.twitter.com/MX9wNGvzds Some people commenting on the photo claimed they had seen that image before the storm struck Florida on Sept. 28. This one is real! The flamingos are residents of Sunken Gardens park, a botanic park based out of St. Petersburg, Florida. The park tweeted the photo from their official account on Sept. 28, saying the flamingos were safe from the oncoming storm. ‚ÄúWe're hunkered down!

In August 1992, Hurricane Andrew, a Category 5 storm, hit Florida and at the time, Miami Zoo‚Äôs Ron Magill took a photo of flamingos huddled up. On the 30 year anniversary of Hurricane Andrew, Magill tweeted about the famous photo, writing, ‚ÄúOf the countless images I have captured in my life, none is more iconic than this one.

For years both journalists and shark scientists have had to put up with the deluge of fake images and videos, telling the public the same message: ‚Äúthis is fake.‚Äù In fact, even the Twitter page for Snopes has begged people to stop sharing the proven false photos and videos. So, it was to no one‚Äôs surprise when a video popped up after Hurricane Ian made landfall in Florida claiming to capture a shark in floodwaters.\nThis video, however, was different.\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,‚Äù Cameratta told news outlets. ...

The fact that this was a new video garnered a lot of attention, racking up millions of views on Twitter. The skepticism was rampant ‚Äì and warranted. The first question many asked was, ‚ÄúIs this an actual video?‚Äù An answer quickly came with both Storyful and The Associated Press confirming its authenticity through examination of the video‚Äôs metadata and subsequent interviews. AP got the scoop from local real estate agent Dominic Cameratta, who confirmed he filmed the clip himself on Wednesday morning. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,‚Äù he told news outlets. ‚ÄúI zoomed in, and all my friends are like: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs like a shark, man!‚Äô‚Äù\nSo, the clip is real. But is that really a shark?\nIt‚Äôs hard to tell ‚Äì and even shark scientists are stumped. George Burgess, a former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History‚Äôs shark program, told the Washington Post that the fish in the video appears to be a juvenile shark. ‚ÄúYoung bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters ‚Äî rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments ‚Äî and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,‚Äù Burgess said. ‚ÄúAssuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.‚Äù\n‚ÄúYoung bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters ‚Äî rivers, estuaries, subtropical ... [+] embayments ‚Äî and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,‚Äù Burgess says.\nDr. Yannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, is on the fence about the video. Papastamatiou pointed to the science that shows many shark species are known to flee shallow, coastal regions ahead of hurricanes, possibly being tipped off to the giant storm‚Äôs arrival by a drastic change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he reckons, or been washed into it.\nBut Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami‚Äôs shark conservation program, isn‚Äôt as convinced, saying it was difficult to tell what exactly the fish was. It should be of note that the video caught the fish swimming near a pond that was overflowing, causing some experts to lean towards this just being an escapee.\nIt seems we will never have a definitive answer to this mystery. While shark experts are split over the identification, some Twitter users were convinced and have dubbed the grainy fish a ‚Äústreet shark.‚Äù Perhaps this is a new rendition for ‚ÄúBaby Shark‚Äù writers to pick up and write a song about?\n\nOne Community.

                "content": "It's common for hoax photos and videos of sharks swimming in flooded streets to surface during hurricanes and they're often quickly debunked. But a new video of a shark in Hurricane Ian's storm surge has people thinking it is the real deal. Hurricane Ian slammed into Florida on Wednesday as a Category 4 hurricane with winds just a few miles per hour away from bumping the classification up to a Category 5. The hurricane resulted in a massive storm surge, and that surge appeared to have pushed a shark into a flooded street in Fort Myers, Florida. While some Twitter users tried to take credit for the video or said they got the video from a friend, the Associated Press has confirmed the video was authentic after speaking with the person who filmed the shark struggling to swim in his backyard. According to the AP report, Dominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer who said he filmed the video Wednesday morning, filmed the shark from his back patio when he saw it flopping around in his neighbor's backyard. Cameratta said at first, he thought the animal was a large fish but soon realized it was a shark. He estimated the shark to be 4 feet long. Cameratta lives near a retention pond, and he said he assumed the shark made it up Hendry Creek and into the pond. The pond then overflowed from storm surge and heavy rain, transporting the shark into the flooded backyard. Some experts told AP they thought the shark looked to be a juvenile. Twitter user THE Alex shared the video at approximately 10 a.m. on Wednesday. The video shows what appears to be a shark flopping around in an apparently flooded street. The animal in the video is seen thrashing its tail back and forth as winds gust in the background. \"My buddy just sent me a video of this shark swimming down his back yard in Fort Myers,\" THE Alex tweeted Wednesday. My buddy just sent me a video of this this shark swimming down his back yard in Fort Myers üòÇ#hurricane #Ian #HurricaneIan pic.twitter.com/kLon2z3F8Q Leslie Guelcher, an assistant professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University who goes by Dr. G on Twitter, was one of the people who questioned the video's authenticity. Prior to AP's verification, Guelcher tweeted that the video index showed a creation date of June 2010. She later told Newsweek she misread the index data, but she is unconvinced the video is real because the video was taken before the storm surge rose in earnest in Fort Myers. \"I'm still not convinced it is accurate although the person who commented provided the name of who filmed it and where,\" Guelcher said. \"However, a reverse image search on Google, limiting to site:Twitter.com shows a number of posts with at least one being from before the storm surge hit.\" She later said she could see how a shark could go from the Gulf of Mexico into a retention pond. However, some experts expect the shark may have sensed a drop in barometric pressure signifying the approaching hurricane. It may have attempted to flee shallow waters to somewhere safer. However, the shark could have accidentally entered the creek and then the pond in its attempts to flee, or flooding could have forced the animal into the residential area. The video's confirmation was the culmination of five years of searching for Jane Lytvynenko, a freelance reporter who has spent years debunking hoaxes. Before the video was confirmed as real, Lytvynenko implied it had credibility. \"I can't believe I'm looking at an honest-to-god street shark,\" Lytvynenko tweeted. \"Good to finally meet you, pal.\" After over half a decade of debunking this hoax every time there was a flood or hurricane, I can't believe I'm looking at an honest-to-god street shark.Good to finally meet you, pal. https://t.co/hwMWX4Peqo Shark hoaxes have emerged in many hurricanes since a fake image of a shark swimming through a flooded highway was first posted in 2012. Social media agency Storyful also verified the video was authentic but couldn't confirm if the footage showed a small shark or a different fish, such as a cobia. Florida officials warned residents that some wildlife might emerge during the storm, namely bears, alligators and snakes, as wildlife becomes more active and disoriented during massive storms.

                "content": "Man films fish ‚Äòflopping around‚Äô in neighbour‚Äôs garden but experts are split over identification\nPhotos and videos of sharks and other marine life swimming in suburban floodwaters make for popular hoaxes during heavy storms. But a mobile phone video filmed during Hurricane Ian‚Äôs assault on south-west Florida isn‚Äôt just another fishy story.\nThe video, which showed a large, dark fish with distinct dorsal fins thrashing around an inundated Fort Myers back yard, racked up more than 12m views on Twitter within a day, as users responded with disbelief and comparisons to the ‚ÄúSharknado‚Äù film series.\nDominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer, confirmed he filmed the clip from his patio on Wednesday morning when he saw something ‚Äúflopping around‚Äù in his neighbour‚Äôs flooded yard.\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI zoomed in, and all my friends are like: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs like a shark, man!‚Äô‚Äù\nHe guessed the fish was about 1.2 metres (4ft) long.\nExperts were divided over whether the clip showed a shark or another large fish. George Burgess, the former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History‚Äôs shark programme, said in an email that it ‚Äúappears to be a juvenile shark‚Äù, while Dr Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami‚Äôs shark conservation programme, wrote that ‚Äúit‚Äôs pretty hard to tell‚Äù.\nNevertheless, some Twitter users dubbed the hapless fish the ‚Äústreet shark‚Äù.\nCameratta said the flooding had only just begun when the video was taken, but that the waters were ‚Äúall the way up to our house‚Äù by the time the Associated Press reached him by phone on Wednesday evening.\nHe said the fish may have made its way up from nearby Hendry Creek into a retention pond, which then overflowed, spilling the creature into his neighbour‚Äôs back yard. A visual analysis of nearby property confirmed it matches the physical landmarks in the video.\nLeslie Guelcher, a professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, was among the online sleuths who initially thought the video was fake.\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think this is real. According to the index on the video it was created in June 2010. Someone else posted it at 10am as in Fort Myers, but the storm surge wasn‚Äôt like that at 10am,‚Äù she tweeted on Wednesday.\nGuelcher acknowledged later, though, that online tools she and others were using to establish the video‚Äôs origins didn‚Äôt actually show when the video itself was created, merely when the social media profile of the user was created.\nThe AP confirmed through the original clip‚Äôs metadata that it was captured on Wednesday morning.\n‚ÄúIt makes a bit more sense from a flooding standpoint,‚Äù Guelcher said by email, when informed the fish was spotted near an overflowing pond. ‚ÄúBut how on earth would a shark go from the Gulf of Mexico to a retention pond?‚Äù\nYannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, said most sharks leave shallow bays ahead of hurricanes, possibly tipped off to their arrival by a change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he said, or been washed into it.\n‚ÄúYoung bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters ‚Äì rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments ‚Äì and often appear in similar videos in Florida water bodies connected to the sea, such as coastal canals and ponds,‚Äù Burgess said. ‚ÄúAssuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.‚Äù\nCameratta sent the video to a group chat on WhatsApp on Wednesday morning, according to his friend John Paul Murray, who sent the AP a timestamped screenshot.",
