There is not a single aspect of children’s lives that the conflict has not impacted, with children killed, injured, forced from their homes, missing out on critical education and denied the benefits of a safe and secure environment.\n“Children in Ukraine have experienced a year of horror,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “Millions of children are going to sleep cold and scared and waking up hoping for an end to this brutal war. Children have been killed and injured, and many have lost parents and siblings, their homes, schools and playgrounds. No child should ever have to bear that kind of suffering.”\nAn economic crisis, with a vast number of families reporting a significant loss of income, along with an energy crisis triggered by the war have been devastating to the well-being of children and families. A recent UNICEF survey saw 80 per cent of respondents noting a deterioration of their economic situation, while UNICEF analysis suggests the percentage of children living in poverty has almost doubled from 43 per cent to 82 per cent. The situation is especially acute for the 5.9 million people who are currently displaced within Ukraine.\nThe war is also having a devastating impact on the mental health and well-being of children. An estimated 1.5 million children are at risk of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health issues, with potential long-term effects and implications.\nChildren and families’ access to basic services have been devastated. More than 800 health facilities are reported to have been damaged or destroyed by shelling and airstrikes, with such attacks killing and causing serious injuries to patients – including children – as well as to medical personnel, and restricting access to care. Thousands of children fleeing conflict across the country are missing vital vaccines to protect them from polio, measles, diphtheria and other life-threatening diseases.\nSince February 24 2022, UNICEF, thanks to the support of the international community, has provided learning supplies to 1.8 million children, engaged over 2.5 million children in formal and non-formal education, provided mental health and psychosocial support to 4.6 million children and caregivers, provided gender-based violence response services to 725,000 women and children, provided access to...[Content truncated]",

Ongoing work to strengthen the emergency response system and build up primary and community mental healthcare provision is paramount.\nBuilding on its 2017 Concept of the National Mental Health Program and the 2021 National Mental Health Action Plan, the Ukrainian government endorsed the publication of an  for MHPSS services, which outlines a framework under which the Ministry of Health, as well as other Ukrainian ministries and government agencies, would coordinate with each other, aid agencies, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to provide care to various groups affected by the conflict.\nTo expand the provision of MHPSS to Ukrainians, the road map lays out avenues through which the Ukrainian government and international stakeholders can build on existing healthcare structures. Over 300 different organizations provide MHPSS in Ukraine according to the WHO, but not all are evidence based and some may be harmful. The introduction of capacity-building programs to primary healthcare providers and community leaders, for example, would enable the provision of  where knowledge was previously absent. Additionally, the expansion of WHO and Ministry of Health–supported  (CMHTs) would give millions of Ukrainians living with moderate to severe mental health conditions access to support many would otherwise not have.

Recognizing the importance of this demographic, the Ministry of Education and Science has partnered with UNICEF and the MHPSS technical working group to promote the inclusion of  in Ukraine’s education system. While awareness of MHPSS is a step in the right direction, it is important to note that much of the road map positions MHPSS within the healthcare system. In a comprehensive system, service would be expanded beyond the formal healthcare sector into other sectors such as education and social services to shift toward a more integrated approach. Other efforts include the UN Population Fund in Ukraine (UNFPA) program , which has helped roughly 3 million adolescents meet anonymously with mental health professionals over social media platforms including Instagram and Telegram. Plans to establish systemic MHPSS care for children, however, remain in their infancy as the full impact of the war...[Content truncated]",

Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Kyiv, Ukraine\n7Department of General Psychology, Faculty of Psychology, Taras Shevchenko National university of Kyiv, Kyiv, Ukraine\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.\nThis study examines the prevalence and predictors of mental health issues, specifically anxiety, depression, and stress, among Ukrainians during the military conflict with Russia.\nA cross-sectional correlational study was conducted six months after the beginning of the conflict. Sociodemographic factors, traumatic experiences, anxiety, depression, and stress were assessed. The study included 706 participants, both men and women, from different age groups and living in various regions of Ukraine. The data were collected from August till October 2022.\nThe study found that a large portion of the Ukrainian population shows increased levels of anxiety, depression, and stress due to the war. Women were found to be more vulnerable to mental health issues than men, and younger people were found to be more resilient. Worsened financial and employment statuses predicted increased anxiety. Ukrainians who fled the conflict to other countries exhibited higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. Direct exposure to trauma predicted increased anxiety and depression, while war-related exposure to “other stressful events” predicted increased acute stress levels.\nThe findings of this study highlight the importance of addressing the mental health needs of Ukrainians affected by the ongoing conflict. Interventions and support should be tailored to address the specific needs of different groups, particularly women, younger individuals, and those with worsened financial and employment statuses.\nWar and military conflicts are events that significantly negatively impact all areas of public life, including the mental health of the communities involved. Stress, depression, and anxiety that accompany stressful events associated with war can profoundly affect the physical health of the entire society, its internal relationships, and daily life. Today, it is known that war substantially impacts the occurrence and severity of mental disorders observed in civilians. In particular, the most common conditions include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety (1–4). At the same time, the deterioration of pre-existing mental disorders is observed both among people living directly on the territory of the military conflict and among internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees (2, 5–9). Most of the existing studies focus on examining the psycho-emotional state and mental health of the affected communities in the post-war periods (1, 2, 4, 10–12).

That's why MSF launched a project to provide psychological support to the medical staff - to guarantee care for caretakers in the hospitals we supported.”\nFor the doctors, MSF psychologists conducted a series of group and individual sessions to help them develop mechanisms for recovery and rest, work through personal concerns and, most importantly, learn not to suppress their emotions. And because during the war, doctors work with people who have experienced occupation, displacement, injury, violence, and loss of home and loved ones, including as the result of the mass casualty missile attacks, such emotions accumulate in excess.\n“The psyche is like a sponge: it absorbs all the information from patients, but it cannot process and squeeze it all out on its own, so if you want to cry and scream, you have to do it,” says Kushnirova. “This may be perceived as a weakness, but the ability to recognise and release such emotions is a great strength.”\nThe psyche is like a sponge: it absorbs all the information from patients, but it cannot process and squeeze it all out on its own, so if you want to cry and scream, you have to do it.

Designed under the Soviet-era Semashko system, Ukrainian mental healthcare services before the war centered on inpatient psychiatric care, while outpatient care and psychosocial support received limited resources. Outpatient services comprised only  of total mental healthcare funding, while psychiatric institutions received the remaining . A , Ukraine’s healthcare system operated on an input basis under which regional health administrators would determine each hospital’s needs and allocate funding from the national health budget accordingly. Although it appeared to allow for , this system continued to reflect norms set out by national health planners. Crucially,  decisions were based on the number of inputs used by the end of each fiscal year, incentivizing hospitals to lengthen patient stays and maximize costs. Ukraine’s mental healthcare resource allocation limitations have  to the country’s psychiatrists and psychologists being overworked and underpaid.\nUkrainian citizens have distrusted mental healthcare services since the Soviet Union  by hospitalizing dissidents and people considered enemies of the state in psychiatric institutions. Moreover, in post-Soviet Ukraine, mental health professionals and paraprofessionals often lacked evidence-based treatment methods, with  of Ukrainian psychologists having trained in pedagogical institutions rather than having a dedicated medical education. Evidence-based methods are crucial to addressing mental health challenges as they are supported by empirical evidence and scientific research that demonstrate their effectiveness. Not utilizing these efforts, along with the other aforementioned structural issues, discouraged many Ukrainians from engaging with any form of mental health services. A  of Ukrainian adults showed that 75 percent of respondents “agreed that psychiatric hospitals seem more like prisons than places where the mentally ill can be cared for.” Given that much of Ukraine’s mental healthcare has long focused on hospitalization, this is a worrying indicator for the prospect of integrating conversations surrounding mental health into social discourse.\nAt the same time, a significant stigma is attached to mental health, which has been an enduring obstacle to seeking any kind of treatment or psychosocial support....[Content truncated]",

That's why MSF launched a project to provide psychological support to the medical staff - to guarantee care for caretakers in the hospitals we supported.”\nFor the doctors, MSF psychologists conducted a series of group and individual sessions to help them develop mechanisms for recovery and rest, work through personal concerns and, most importantly, learn not to suppress their emotions. And because during the war, doctors work with people who have experienced occupation, displacement, injury, violence, and loss of home and loved ones, including as the result of the mass casualty missile attacks, such emotions accumulate in excess.\n“The psyche is like a sponge: it absorbs all the information from patients, but it cannot process and squeeze it all out on its own, so if you want to cry and scream, you have to do it,” says Kushnirova. “This may be perceived as a weakness, but the ability to recognise and release such emotions is a great strength.”\nThe psyche is like a sponge: it absorbs all the information from patients, but it cannot process and squeeze it all out on its own, so if you want to cry and scream, you have to do it.

In 2022 and 2023 alone, we provided 26,324 individual mental health consultations.

There is not a single aspect of children’s lives that the conflict has not impacted, with children killed, injured, forced from their homes, missing out on critical education and denied the benefits of a safe and secure environment.\n“Children in Ukraine have experienced a year of horror,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “Millions of children are going to sleep cold and scared and waking up hoping for an end to this brutal war. Children have been killed and injured, and many have lost parents and siblings, their homes, schools and playgrounds. No child should ever have to bear that kind of suffering.”\nAn economic crisis, with a vast number of families reporting a significant loss of income, along with an energy crisis triggered by the war have been devastating to the well-being of children and families. A recent UNICEF survey saw 80 per cent of respondents noting a deterioration of their economic situation, while UNICEF analysis suggests the percentage of children living in poverty has almost doubled from 43 per cent to 82 per cent. The situation is especially acute for the 5.9 million people who are currently displaced within Ukraine.\nThe war is also having a devastating impact on the mental health and well-being of children. An estimated 1.5 million children are at risk of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health issues, with potential long-term effects and implications.\nChildren and families’ access to basic services have been devastated. More than 800 health facilities are reported to have been damaged or destroyed by shelling and airstrikes, with such attacks killing and causing serious injuries to patients – including children – as well as to medical personnel, and restricting access to care. Thousands of children fleeing conflict across the country are missing vital vaccines to protect them from polio, measles, diphtheria and other life-threatening diseases.\nSince February 24 2022, UNICEF, thanks to the support of the international community, has provided learning supplies to 1.8 million children, engaged over 2.5 million children in formal and non-formal education, provided mental health and psychosocial support to 4.6 million children and caregivers, provided gender-based violence response services to 725,000 women and children, provided access to...[Content truncated]"

Ongoing work to strengthen the emergency response system and build up primary and community mental healthcare provision is paramount.\nBuilding on its 2017 Concept of the National Mental Health Program and the 2021 National Mental Health Action Plan, the Ukrainian government endorsed the publication of an  for MHPSS services, which outlines a framework under which the Ministry of Health, as well as other Ukrainian ministries and government agencies, would coordinate with each other, aid agencies, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to provide care to various groups affected by the conflict.\nTo expand the provision of MHPSS to Ukrainians, the road map lays out avenues through which the Ukrainian government and international stakeholders can build on existing healthcare structures. Over 300 different organizations provide MHPSS in Ukraine according to the WHO, but not all are evidence based and some may be harmful. The introduction of capacity-building programs to primary healthcare providers and community leaders, for example, would enable the provision of  where knowledge was previously absent. Additionally, the expansion of WHO and Ministry of Health–supported  (CMHTs) would give millions of Ukrainians living with moderate to severe mental health conditions access to support many would otherwise not have. Given the immediate need for the support these types of programs offer, their growth has been . The early success of some of these programs has supported the Ministry of Health’s aims to eventually scale and expand them, though plans for how to integrate these stopgap measures into Ukraine’s long-term mental healthcare goals remain to be seen.\nThe  enumerates several measures to tackle immediate MHPSS needs for at-risk groups, including children, veterans, the elderly, internally displaced people (IDPs), and people with disabilities.

Recognizing the importance of this demographic, the Ministry of Education and Science has partnered with UNICEF and the MHPSS technical working group to promote the inclusion of  in Ukraine’s education system. While awareness of MHPSS is a step in the right direction, it is important to note that much of the road map positions MHPSS within the healthcare system. In a comprehensive system, service would be expanded beyond the formal healthcare sector into other sectors such as education and social services to shift toward a more integrated approach. Other efforts include the UN Population Fund in Ukraine (UNFPA) program , which has helped roughly 3 million adolescents meet anonymously with mental health professionals over social media platforms including Instagram and Telegram.

        "Question": "What is the context of leisure activities in Kyiv amid the war's psychological and social impacts on residents?",
        "Answer": "Leisure activities in Kyiv, such as beach parties and social gatherings, exist amidst a backdrop of significant psychological and social impacts due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. Despite these recreational activities appearing to present a semblance of normalcy, they are deeply intertwined with the trauma and psychological strain faced by many residents. Here are several key points to consider regarding this context:\n\n1. **Psychological Toll of War on Residents**: The war in Ukraine has taken a heavy toll on the mental health of the population. Reports indicate a rise in mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among individuals affected by the conflict. A UNICEF report states that millions of children, in particular, face severe psychological distress as a consequence of the war, which complicates the capacity for normal leisure activities and enjoyment of social interactions. The presence of leisure activities may serve as temporary distractions for individuals seeking relief from pervasive fear and anxiety.\n\n2. **Desire for Normalcy**: Engaging in leisure activities can represent a form of resistance and a pursuit of normalcy amidst chaos. People may choose to participate in social events, like beach parties, as an act of defiance against the oppressive atmosphere created by the conflict. However, while these moments may appear carefree, they do not negate the underlying tension in the city, as many attendees remain acutely aware of the ongoing violence surrounding them.\n\n3. **Survival Mechanism**: In hostile environments, socializing can often be viewed as a survival mechanism. Communities may actively create spaces for leisure to foster resilience and support among each other amid shared trauma. This need for connection doesn't erase the reality of war but transforms it into a context in which people seek solace and solidarity through leisure despite the psychological impacts they are experiencing.\n\n4. **Economic Hardship**: The war has led to widespread economic challenges, with many families experiencing financial insecurity. UNICEF's analysis revealed that a significant percentage of families have reported a deterioration of their economic situation, leading to a dramatic rise in poverty among children. Despite the economic strain, some residents may still seek out leisure activities as a brief escape or means to lift their spirits, although this can present a juxtaposition to their financial realities.\n\n5. **Long-term Implications**: As leisure activities become intertwined with the ongoing trauma, there are long-term implications for mental health and community dynamics. The presence of recreational outlets in a war-torn environment may risk trivializing the psychological impacts of the conflict and lead to a superficial understanding of the war's reality. In this sense, while some may partake in leisure activities, they often carry the emotional burden of loss and trauma with them, highlighting the complexities of such experiences in a conflict zone.\n\nIn conclusion, while leisure activities continue in Kyiv, they unfold against a backdrop of psychological distress caused by the war. The existence of these activities reflects the community's need for normalcy and resilience yet underscores the profound social and mental health challenges that persist.",
