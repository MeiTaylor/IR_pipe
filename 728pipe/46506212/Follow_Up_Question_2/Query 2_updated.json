Some 5.3 million children face barriers preventing access to education, including 3.6 million children directly affected by school closures. This places children in Ukraine at risk of losing critical years of schooling and social development. Since February 2022, UNICEF has supported nearly 1.5 million of the most vulnerable children in Ukraine to access formal and non-formal education, including early learning.\nSince war began, over 2,600 schools have been damaged and over 400 destroyed across Ukraine, according to the Ministry of Education. Only approximately 25 per cent of Ukrainian schools nationwide have been able to offer full-time, in-person learning since September.

Education is critical to children\u2019s well-being and social development. It cannot be put on hold without risking the future of an entire generation. Lives of millions will be infinitely harder if we fail to help them continue their education now,\u201d emphasized UNICEF Ukraine Representative Murat Sahin.\nBeyond education, schools also play a critical role in the social development of children, which is critical for managing the psychosocial stressors and traumas that war brings.

Schools play a critical role in managing the mental...[Content truncated]",

That's why MSF launched a project to provide psychological support to the medical staff - to guarantee care for caretakers in the hospitals we supported.\u201d\nFor the doctors, MSF psychologists conducted a series of group and individual sessions to help them develop mechanisms for recovery and rest, work through personal concerns and, most importantly, learn not to suppress their emotions. And because during the war, doctors work with people who have experienced occupation, displacement, injury, violence, and loss of home and loved ones, including as the result of the mass casualty missile attacks, such emotions accumulate in excess.\n\u201cThe psyche is like a sponge: it absorbs all the information from patients, but it cannot process and squeeze it all out on its own, so if you want to cry and scream, you have to do it,\u201d says Kushnirova. \u201cThis may be perceived as a weakness, but the ability to recognise and release such emotions is a great strength.\u201d\nThe psyche is like a sponge: it absorbs all the information from patients, but it cannot process and squeeze it all out on its own, so if you want to cry and scream, you have to do it.

The promotion of MHPSS is crucial for building human capital and incentivizing Ukrainians abroad to return to their homeland. There are both immediate actions and long-term interventions that the Ukrainian government and its international partners can take to build a strong healthcare system in the country.\nThe promotion of MHPSS is crucial for building human capital and incentivizing Ukrainians abroad to return to their homeland.\n#### **Challenges to the Ukrainian Mental Health Infrastructure before the War**\nUkraine\u2019s mental healthcare system has remained  since the country gained independence in 1991; it received only 2.5 percent of Ukraine\u2019s health budget in 2020. Designed under the Soviet-era Semashko system, Ukrainian mental healthcare services before the war centered on inpatient psychiatric care, while outpatient care and psychosocial support received limited resources. Outpatient services comprised only  of total mental healthcare funding, while psychiatric institutions received the remaining . A , Ukraine\u2019s healthcare system operated on an input basis under which regional health administrators would determine each hospital\u2019s needs and allocate funding from the national health budget accordingly. Although it appeared to allow for , this system continued to reflect norms set out by national health planners. Crucially,  decisions were based on the number of inputs used by the end of each fiscal year, incentivizing hospitals to lengthen patient stays and maximize costs. Ukraine\u2019s mental healthcare resource allocation limitations have  to the country\u2019s psychiatrists and psychologists being overworked and underpaid.\nUkrainian citizens have distrusted mental healthcare services since the Soviet Union  by hospitalizing dissidents and people considered enemies of the state in psychiatric institutions. Moreover, in post-Soviet Ukraine, mental health professionals and paraprofessionals often lacked evidence-based treatment methods, with  of Ukrainian psychologists having trained in pedagogical institutions rather than having a dedicated medical education. Evidence-based methods are crucial to addressing mental health challenges as they are supported by empirical evidence and scientific research that demonstrate their effectiveness. Not utilizing these efforts, along with the other aforementioned structural issues, discouraged many Ukrainians from engaging with any form of mental health services. A  of Ukrainian adults showed that 75 percent of respondents \u201cagreed that psychiatric hospitals seem more like prisons than places where the mentally ill can be cared for.\u201d Given that much of Ukraine\u2019s mental healthcare has long focused on hospitalization, this is a worrying indicator for the prospect of integrating conversations surrounding mental health into social discourse.\nAt the same time, a significant stigma is attached to mental health, which has been an enduring obstacle to seeking any kind of treatment or psychosocial support....[Content truncated]",

Ground is shaking from explosions.\"\n\n We talked for a bit via text and discussed whether he should leave the city. I scavenged for any news I could find. By 1 a.m., it was becoming obvious: War on Ukraine had begun. To suppress panic and denial, I forced myself to go to sleep. I always thought those psychological stages (denial, acceptance, etc.) weren't true. Unfortunately, I was in for a rude awakening.\n\n By the time I woke up the next morning, my dad had written me to say...[Content truncated]",

If we must die, then we might as well all die together. That is how we left without any kind of plan. We had no great hopes. There were no discussions. There was no soul searching.

They led to my professional work as an anthropologist, in which I spend countless hours listening to, engaging with, and elevating the voices of war- and genocide-affected populations in countries such as Cambodia and Rwanda. At the center of my work is the question: how do people heal from such atrocity?\nI started my informal \"training\" as an anthropologist decades ago, in my grandparents' cramped kitchen in Newark, Delaware.
