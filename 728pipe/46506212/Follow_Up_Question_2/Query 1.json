There is not a single aspect of children’s lives that the conflict has not impacted, with children killed, injured, forced from their homes, missing out on critical education and denied the benefits of a safe and secure environment.\n“Children in Ukraine have experienced a year of horror,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “Millions of children are going to sleep cold and scared and waking up hoping for an end to this brutal war. Children have been killed and injured, and many have lost parents and siblings, their homes, schools and playgrounds. No child should ever have to bear that kind of suffering.”\nAn economic crisis, with a vast number of families reporting a significant loss of income, along with an energy crisis triggered by the war have been devastating to the well-being of children and families. A recent UNICEF survey saw 80 per cent of respondents noting a deterioration of their economic situation, while UNICEF analysis suggests the percentage of children living in poverty has almost doubled from 43 per cent to 82 per cent. The situation is especially acute for the 5.9 million people who are currently displaced within Ukraine.\nThe war is also having a devastating impact on the mental health and well-being of children. An estimated 1.5 million children are at risk of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health issues, with potential long-term effects and implications.\nChildren and families’ access to basic services have been devastated. More than 800 health facilities are reported to have been damaged or destroyed by shelling and airstrikes, with such attacks killing and causing serious injuries to patients – including children – as well as to medical personnel, and restricting access to care. Thousands of children fleeing conflict across the country are missing vital vaccines to protect them from polio, measles, diphtheria and other life-threatening diseases.\nSince February 24 2022, UNICEF, thanks to the support of the international community, has provided learning supplies to 1.8 million children, engaged over 2.5 million children in formal and non-formal education, provided mental health and psychosocial support to 4.6 million children and caregivers, provided gender-based violence response services to 725,000 women and children, provided access to...[Content truncated]",

Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Kyiv, Ukraine\n7Department of General Psychology, Faculty of Psychology, Taras Shevchenko National university of Kyiv, Kyiv, Ukraine\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.\nThis study examines the prevalence and predictors of mental health issues, specifically anxiety, depression, and stress, among Ukrainians during the military conflict with Russia.\nA cross-sectional correlational study was conducted six months after the beginning of the conflict. Sociodemographic factors, traumatic experiences, anxiety, depression, and stress were assessed. The study included 706 participants, both men and women, from different age groups and living in various regions of Ukraine. The data were collected from August till October 2022.\nThe study found that a large portion of the Ukrainian population shows increased levels of anxiety, depression, and stress due to the war. Women were found to be more vulnerable to mental health issues than men, and younger people were found to be more resilient. Worsened financial and employment statuses predicted increased anxiety. Ukrainians who fled the conflict to other countries exhibited higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. Direct exposure to trauma predicted increased anxiety and depression, while war-related exposure to “other stressful events” predicted increased acute stress levels.\nThe findings of this study highlight the importance of addressing the mental health needs of Ukrainians affected by the ongoing conflict. Interventions and support should be tailored to address the specific needs of different groups, particularly women, younger individuals, and those with worsened financial and employment statuses.\nWar and military conflicts are events that significantly negatively impact all areas of public life, including the mental health of the communities involved. Stress, depression, and anxiety that accompany stressful events associated with war can profoundly affect the physical health of the entire society, its internal relationships, and daily life. Today, it is known that war substantially impacts the occurrence and severity of mental disorders observed in civilians. In particular, the most common conditions include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety (1–4). At the same time, the deterioration of pre-existing mental disorders is observed both among people living directly on the territory of the military conflict and among internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees (2, 5–9). Most of the existing studies focus on examining the psycho-emotional state and mental health of the affected communities in the post-war periods (1, 2, 4, 10–12).

The first Serbian snipers and grenades were launched at Sarajevo, my hometown, in April 1992. My early years, which were supposed to be filled with freedom, joy, laughter, and lightheartedness, turned into four years of constant fear, pain, loss, and devastation. Until the war ended in December 1995, my childhood felt like a never-ending stream of shelling, air-raid sirens, cries, and suffering.\nWar arrived in my hometown in the blink of an eye. Only months before the conflict started, Yugoslavia had disintegrated politically, following protests and riots between pro- and anti-separatists in the major cities of the six constituent republics (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia). The upheaval paved the way for poisonous political rhetoric, dividing friends, neighbors, and even families by their ethnic or religious affiliation.  \nMy childhood felt like a never-ending stream of shelling, air-raid sirens, cries, and suffering\nFor four years, the city I knew—the once-celebrated host city of the Winter Olympics—was shelled almost daily, and everyday life was in stasis. Basements and shelters were our new homes, playgrounds, and classrooms. Saraje...[Content truncated]",

Despite Articles 51(4)(a) and 51(5)(b) of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions on the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, the Russian army has targeted civilians, damaged civilian infrastructure, and directly caused deaths and injuries of children. The war escalation since February 24, 2022 challenges the implementation of every child’s right defined by CRC.\nArticle 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child guarantees protection of the child from all forms of physical or psychological violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation by carers. However, in the conditions of war, children experience various forms of violence, lose stable and safe family environments, become forced migrants and refugees, and are exposed to numerous threats.\nAccording to the Ombudsman for Children's Rights in Ukraine, Daryna Herasymchuk, 19.5 thousand Ukrainian children have been deported and deprived of their right to identity, which includes citizenship, name and family ties (Article 8), right to speak their Ukrainian language, and contacts with others outside occupied territory.\nChild trafficking has increased and there are more child deportations to the Russian Federation as a result of the war.\nThe long-term mental health effects of war could impede children’s ability to fully participate in everyday life. Negative mental health effects on children are already evident.\nSignificant numbers of children have been left without access to critically important medical services. Medical personnel are lacking as a consequence of mobilisation.\nEducational access has been severely impacted: as of February 2023, 2660 education institutions have been attacked and 438 destroyed.\n1,051 children living in vulnerable families face increased need for support, and urgent and immediate actions are needed to protect 126 children whose parents/legal guardians neglected their needs and risk cruel treatment. Measures to prevent violence against children in Ukraine are informal and not systemic. There is a lack of data and research on child violence.\nBefore the war, almost 100,000 children were in alternative care and this has only increased further. 24,000 have been reunited with their families without necessary support or follow-up. Almost 80% of these children have special educational needs requiring support. Many children have been evacuated to other countries.

Ongoing work to strengthen the emergency response system and build up primary and community mental healthcare provision is paramount.\nBuilding on its 2017 Concept of the National Mental Health Program and the 2021 National Mental Health Action Plan, the Ukrainian government endorsed the publication of an  for MHPSS services, which outlines a framework under which the Ministry of Health, as well as other Ukrainian ministries and government agencies, would coordinate with each other, aid agencies, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to provide care to various groups affected by the conflict.\nTo expand the provision of MHPSS to Ukrainians, the road map lays out avenues through which the Ukrainian government and international stakeholders can build on existing healthcare structures. Over 300 different organizations provide MHPSS in Ukraine according to the WHO, but not all are evidence based and some may be harmful. The introduction of capacity-building programs to primary healthcare providers and community leaders, for example, would enable the provision of  where knowledge was previously absent. Additionally, the expansion of WHO and Ministry of Health–supported  (CMHTs) would give millions of Ukrainians living with moderate to severe mental health conditions access to support many would otherwise not have. Given the immediate need for the support these types of programs offer, their growth has been . The early success of some of these programs has supported the Ministry of Health’s aims to eventually scale and expand them, though plans for how to integrate these stopgap measures into Ukraine’s long-term mental healthcare goals remain to be seen.\nThe  enumerates several measures to tackle immediate MHPSS needs for at-risk groups, including children, veterans, the elderly, internally displaced people (IDPs), and people with disabilities. Numbering approximately ,  are especially vulnerable to the long-term effects of war-induced trauma and disruption. Recognizing the importance of this demographic, the Ministry of Education and Science has partnered with UNICEF and the MHPSS technical working group to promote the inclusion of  in Ukraine’s education system. While awareness of MHPSS is a step in the right direction, it is important to note that much of the road map positions MHPSS within the healthcare system. In a comprehensive system, service would be expanded beyond the formal healthcare sector into other sectors such as education and social services to shift toward a more integrated approach. Other efforts include the UN Population Fund in Ukraine (UNFPA) program , which has helped roughly 3 million adolescents meet anonymously with mental health professionals over social media platforms including Instagram and Telegram.
