The Alliance fully supports Ukraine’s inherent right to self-defence, and its right to choose its own security arrangements. Ukraine’s future is in NATO. Relations between NATO and Ukraine date back to the early 1990s and have since developed into one of the most substantial of NATO’s partnerships. Since 2014, in the wake of Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea, cooperation has been intensified in critical areas. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, NATO and Allies have provided unprecedented levels of support."

In 2023, the Commission was replaced by the NATO-Ukraine Council, where Allies and Ukraine sit as equals. This change demonstrates the strengthening of political ties and Ukraine’s increasing integration with NATO.\n*   Cooperation has deepened over time and is mutually beneficial. Ukraine has a long track record of active contributions to NATO-led operations and missions.\n**Political and practical support to Ukraine**\n*   NATO condemns Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine in the strongest possible terms. This aggression gravely undermines Euro-Atlantic and global security, and is a blatant violation of international law. NATO Allies, in concert with relevant resolutions of the UN General Assembly, demand that Russia stop the war immediately, cease its use of force against Ukraine, and completely and unconditionally withdraw all its forces from Ukraine.\n*   The Allies do not and will never recognise Russia's illegal and illegitimate annexations, including of Crimea. Since Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and the beginning of its aggression in eastern Ukraine in 2014, NATO has reinforced its support for capability development and capacity-building in Ukraine, alongside Allied training of tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops.\n*   Since the NATO Summit in Warsaw in July 2016, NATO's practical support for Ukraine is set out in the Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP) for Ukraine. At the 2022 Madrid Summit, Allies strengthened the CAP to provide even more support to Ukraine. At the 2023 Vilnius Summit, Allies agreed to further develop the CAP into a multi-year programme of assistance, to help rebuild the Ukrainian security and defence sector and transition Ukraine towards full interoperability with NATO.\n*   At the 2024 Washington Summit, Allies agreed to establish NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) to coordinate the provision of military equipment and training for Ukraine by Allies and partners. They also announced a Pledge of Long-Term Security Assistance for Ukraine, providing a minimum baseline funding of EUR ...[Content truncated]",

Six Russian regions including Moscow came under attack early Wednesday, while in the city of Pskov, near the Estonian border, several transport planes were reportedly damaged when drones targeted an airport. Russian officials haven’t reported any casualties, and claimed to have thwarted almost all of the strikes.\n    \n\n            Ukraine has increasingly been emboldened to hit strategic targets inside Russia through the air in recent weeks, even as it suffers assaults on its own cities, setting up a new phase of the conflict defined by Kyiv’s apparent efforts to wear down domestic Russian support for the war.\n    \n\n            Kyiv officials meanwhile said Russia hit the Ukrainian capital with a “massive” bombardment overnight. \n    \n\nCNN’s Rob Picheta, Anna Chernova and Gul Tuysuz contributed reporting to this post.\n\n\n            The northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv has set up 60 classrooms in its subway ahead of the start of the school year in September, the mayor said in a statement.\n    \n\n            Kharkiv, which lies roughly 20 miles from the Russian border, was occupied by Russian forces in the early months of the war. Ukraine managed to liberate the city in September last year — but Russian forces have since tried to recapture the city, which has come under frequent bombardment for much of this summer.\n    \n\n            The underground classrooms will accommodate around 1,000 students, with plans to set up even more classrooms to allow for safe in-person education several days a week, Kharkiv mayor Ihor Terekhov said.\n    \n\n            The city’s subways were the main shelter for its residents during intense Russian bombardment in the first few months of the war.\n    \n\n            Ukraine ordered mandatory evacuations in Kharkiv region earlier this month, after a local Ukrainian official said that substantial reinforcements had turned the area into the “epicenter” of hostilities.\n    \n\n            Russia claimed to have captured several Ukrainian positions near the city of Kharkiv in recent weeks, with the eventual goal of capturing the city for a second time. \n    \n\n            A Kremlin spokesman has attributed the biggest drone assault on Russian territory since the war in Ukraine began to the “continued terrorist activity of the Kyiv regime.” \n    \n\n            The Russian President Vladimir Putin is receiving “timely and up-to-date information” on all developments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday. \n    \n\n        “Of course, with regard to such massive attacks, the information is also immediately brought to the attention of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief [Vladimir Putin],” Peskov added.\n    \n\n            Journalists on the regular Kremlin call pressed P...[Content truncated]",

For these reasons, the Monitor will not be providing regular fatality estimate updates at this time.(javascript:void\\(0\\))Tracking fatalities is one of the most difficult aspects of conflict data collection in general, as fatality counts are frequently the most biased, inconsistent, and poorly documented components of conflict reporting, and this is especially true of active conflict environments impacted by high levels of mis/disinformation and severe access constraints. ACLED defaults to conservative estimates based on the best available information at the time of coding in line with our specific  and . ACLED estimates are restricted to fatalities reported during individual events, meaning that these estimates may be particularly conservative in comparison with sources that do not use an event-based methodology. When and where possible, ACLED researchers seek out information to triangulate the numbers from any report, but we do not independently verify fatalities. ACLED is also a ‘living dataset’, so all fatality figures are revised and corrected — upward or downward — if new or better information becomes available (which, in some conflict contexts, can be months or years after an event has taken place). These figures should therefore be understood as indicative estimates rather than definitive fatality counts (for more on ACLED’s approach to coding fatalities, see ). ACLED additionally only captures fatalities that are directly caused by political violence; indirect conflict-related fatalities caused by disease or starvation, for example, are not included in these estimates. Other sources may come to different figures due to differing methodologies and catchments.\n**Jump to**\n**Ukraine Conflict Situation Update**:  \n13 – 19 July 2024\n----------------------------------------------------------\nRussian forces continued offensive operations along the frontline in the Donetsk region. They claimed a village north of Bakhmut and another south of Velyka Novosilka, near the boundary with the Zaporizhia region. Russian forces also continued advancing northwest of Donetsk city and captured tactically significant terrain in the area of Vuhledar, threatening a Ukrainian supply line to the latter. In the Kharkiv region, clashes continued in the area of Kupiansk, as well as in and near Vovchansk in the northern part of the region.

Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, said the city had “not experienced such a powerful attack since spring.”\nThe early-morning strikes on Kyiv came after a slew of drone attacks targeted at least six Russian regions, including one at a military airfield in Pskov that reportedly damaged four Russian military aircraft, Russia’s Defense Ministry said. \nHere’s the latest on the war and its impact across the globe.\nLithuania summoned the country’s papal envoy Wednesday over remarks by Pope Francis at the weekend that appeared to glorify Russia’s imperial past and sparking a backlash. Francis veered from a planned speech to tell a group of Russian Catholic youths that they were “heirs to the Great Russia, the Great Russia of saints, of kings, the Great Russia of Peter the Great, of Catherine the Second, that great and cultured Russian empire, with so much culture and so much humanity.” The comment drew criticism, including from the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. “The Pope intended to encourage young people to preserve and promote all that is positive in the great cultural and Russian spirituality, and certainly not to exalt imperialist logic and government personalities,” Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement.\nThe Kyiv drone attacks killed two people, ages 26 and 36, according to Kyiv’s military administration, and injured and hospitalized two others, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Wednesday on Telegram.

Operation Atlantic Resolve—the military operation to bolster the NATO alliance and support Ukraine in response to Russia’s aggression—became an overseas contingency operation in August 2023, triggering a quarterly reporting requirement for the OIGs starting in early 2024. In December 2023, Congress designated the IG responsible for coordinating quarterly reporting as the Special IG for Operation Atlantic Resolve.

( Murat Özgür Güvendik - Anadolu Agency )  \n**ISTANBUL**\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday reiterated that the war in Ukraine was caused by the West and Kyiv's hostile actions, and a desire by some countries to maintain their global hegemony.\n“I want to note that it was the desire to maintain their hegemony in the world, the desire of some countries to maintain this hegemony that led to the severe crisis in Ukraine,” Putin said in his speech via video link at the 15th BRICS Summit in Johannesburg.\nThe “crisis,” he said, was first created during the 2014 Maidan protests, which he described as an “unconstitutional coup d'etat” with the help of Western countries.\nThe protests in Ukraine, which Moscow claims were supported by the West, had led to the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych, who was viewed as pro-Russian.\nSince then, Russian-speaking citizens in Donbas, eastern Ukraine have been fighting the Ukrainian army.\nIn February 2022, Moscow launched its “special military operation” to “denazify” and “demilitarize” Ukraine, and protect the country's Russian-speaking population.\nThe Russian president said the eight-year war was started “against those people who did not agree with this coup d'état, a cruel war, a war of extermination,” adding that Moscow supported those “fighting for their culture, for their traditions, for their language, for their future.”\n“Our actions in Ukraine are dictated by only one thing - to put an end to the war that was unleashed by the West and its satellites in Ukraine against the people living in the Donbas,” Putin said.\nThe Russian leader said the BRICS economic bloc - which also includes Brazil, India, China, and South Africa - is unanimously in favor of the formation of a multipolar world order that is “truly fair and based on international law.\"\n“We are against any kind of hegemony promoted by some countries for their exclusivity and based on this postulate of a new policy - the policy of continuing neo-colonialism,” he said.\nTouching upon Russia’s upcoming chairmanship of the economic bloc for next year, Putin said the next BRICS summit could be held in the city of Kazan.\n###### Related topics\n###### Bu haberi paylaşın\n !\n!\n* * *\n...[Content truncated]",
