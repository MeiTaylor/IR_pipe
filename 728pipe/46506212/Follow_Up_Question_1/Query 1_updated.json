Operation Atlantic Resolve\u2014the military operation to bolster the NATO alliance and support Ukraine in response to Russia\u2019s aggression\u2014became an overseas contingency operation in August 2023, triggering a quarterly reporting requirement for the OIGs starting in early 2024. In December 2023, Congress designated the IG responsible for coordinating quarterly reporting as the Special IG for Operation Atlantic Resolve. Special IG quarterly reports on Operation Atlantic Resolve provide information on U.S. government programs and operations related to the U.S. government response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The reports include a summary of the OIGs\u2019 collective oversight of the Ukraine response effort.\n##### \nOIG is prioritizing inspections of overseas missions directly affected by the war in Ukraine. While engaging frankly on Russian Federation government actions that threaten international systems, U.S. Embassy Moscow aims to promote mutual understanding among Americans and Russians and sustain programmatic modes of interaction on issues of mutual benefit. In conducting this inspection, OIG will assess the mission\u2019s executive direction, policy implementation, resource management, and management controls.\n##### \nThe Bureau of Political-Military Affairs plays a key role in facilitating arms transfers and legitimate defense trade, as well as preventing diversion of defense articles to illicit channels, including in the context of U.S. government Ukraine response efforts.

This aggression gravely undermines Euro-Atlantic and global security, and is a blatant violation of international law. NATO Allies, in concert with relevant resolutions of the UN General Assembly, demand that Russia stop the war immediately, cease its use of force against Ukraine, and completely and unconditionally withdraw all its forces from Ukraine.\n*   The Allies do not and will never recognise Russia's illegal and illegitimate annexations, including of Crimea. Since Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and the beginning of its aggression in eastern Ukraine in 2014,\u00a0NATO has reinforced its support for capability development and capacity-building in Ukraine, alongside Allied training of tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops.\n*   Since the NATO Summit in Warsaw in July 2016, NATO's practical support for Ukraine is set out in the Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP) for Ukraine. At the 2022 Madrid Summit, Allies strengthened the CAP to provide even more support to Ukraine. At the 2023 Vilnius Summit, Allies agreed to further develop the CAP into a multi-year programme of assistance, to help rebuild the Ukrainian security and defence sector and transition Ukraine towards full interoperability with NATO.\n*   At the 2024 Washington Summit, Allies agreed to establish NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) to coordinate the provision of military equipment and training for Ukraine by Allies and partners. They also announced a Pledge of Long-Term Security Assistance for Ukraine, providing a minimum baseline funding of EUR 40 billion within the next year, and sustainable levels of security assistance in the future.\n*   NATO stands in unwavering solidarity with the government and people of Ukraine in the heroic defence of their nation, their land and our shared values.\u00a0The Alliance fully supports Ukraine\u2019s inherent right to self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.\u00a0\n**Ukraine\u2019s membership aspirations**\n*   In response to Ukraine\u2019s aspirations for NATO membership, Allies agreed at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Ukraine will become a member of NATO. They also agreed that Ukraine\u2019s next step on its way to membership was the Membership Action Plan (MAP), NATO\u2019s programme of political, economic, defence, resource, security and legal reforms for aspirant countries.

We will continue to collaborate across the U.S. government and with our international allies to eradicate cyber threats.\u201d  \nThe report is being released now because of the targeting involved, the fact this is new malware, and the actor group having targeted U.S. government and Defense Industrial Base in the past. The information in the publication will help National Security System, Department of Defense, and Defense Industrial Base network defenders defend against malicious cyber actors.  \nThe malware analysis report was jointly issued by the United Kingdom\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK), the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), New Zealand\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ), Canada\u2019s Communications Security Establishment (CSE) and Australian Signals Directorate (ASD).  \nThe Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) publicly uncovered the Infamous Chisel malware campaign in early August 2023 and associated it with the Sandworm threat actor.

While the attacks have no impact on oil prices globally, their continuation could destabilize the Russian domestic market.\n**The German Marshall Fund of the United States**\nThe article examines the productivity of the Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC) on June 11\u201312. Discussions at a pre-URC conference suggest that a recent and sudden high-level personnel move in Kyiv risks becoming a distraction and a source of uncertainty that will dominate the URC. The Ukrainian government should save the top annual international conference dedicated to Ukraine from this misfortune by immediately appointing a permanent minister of restoration and by publicly committing to transparency both at home and with international donors.\n**The German Marshall Fund of the United State**s\nThis article explains how Russia has adapted its strategy for the war in Ukraine. Airstrikes against power generation facilities aim to make Ukrainian cities unlivable. Russia is currently laying waste to Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, by launching attacks from an effectively US-granted safe harbor on the Russian side of the border. And disinformation in the West has become the Russian strategy that matters most to the outcome of the war.\n**Ulkopoliittinen instituutti (Finnish Institute of International Affairs)**\nAlthough a notable proportion of the Russian population regards the election and Putin\u2019s leadership as legitimate, their support for Russia\u2019s military actions in Ukraine is waning. Only a slim majority backs the continuation of the conflict. According to the author, the post-election period is likely to see the persistence of Russia\u2019s current domestic and foreign policies, with the potential for increased societal and economic tensions.\n**European Policy Centre**\nThis paper analyses the arguments around seizing Russian state assets for Ukraine. Indeed, the authors highlight that the immediate rebuilding of critical infrastructure is crucial to keeping Ukraine\u2019s economy running and for its defence, as the country will not be able to rebuild if it no longer exists. Moreover, failure to seize the reserves could encourage further crimes of aggression and undermine the geopolitical order.\n**International Institute for Strategic Studies**\nThe report written by 11 leading international lawyers sets out the legal case for seizing Russian central-bank assets and transferring them to Ukraine under the established doctrine of state countermeasure, which permits states lawfully to carry out actions against a state that has violated fundamental rules of international law.\n**Brookings Institution**\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Russia\u2019s foreign exchange reserves held by the U.S. and its allies were frozen.

In total, the Federal Republic of Germany has so far provided or committed for future years military assistance with a value of approximately 28 billion euro.\n**Funds for the security capacity building** **initiative** in 2024 alone for military assistance to Ukraine amount to approximately 7.1 billion euro. From these also Germany\u2019s contributions to the European Peace Facility of the European Union (EPF) are financed.

Additional approximately 2.9 billion euro have been committed in the first two years of the war for deliveries, which will arrive only in the years 2025 to 2028.\nSince the beginning of the Russian armed attack on Ukraine on February 24, 2022 Germany has delivered **material from Federal Armed Forces stocks** amounting to approximately 5.2 billion euro reflecting estimated replacement values. Also, more than 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers have received military training in Germany. Expenses for this **training** so far amount to approximately 282 million euro.
