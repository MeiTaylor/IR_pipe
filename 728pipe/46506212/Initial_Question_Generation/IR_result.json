Six Russian regions including Moscow came under attack early Wednesday, while in the city of Pskov, near the Estonian border, several transport planes were reportedly damaged when drones targeted an airport.

Ukraine managed to liberate the city in September last year — but Russian forces have since tried to recapture the city, which has come under frequent bombardment for much of this summer.\n    \n\n            The underground classrooms will accommodate around 1,000 students, with plans to set up even more classrooms to allow for safe in-person education several days a week, Kharkiv mayor Ihor Terekhov said.\n    \n\n            The city’s subways were the main shelter for its residents during intense Russian bombardment in the first few months of the war.\n    \n\n            Ukraine ordered mandatory evacuations in Kharkiv region earlier this month, after a local Ukrainian official said that substantial reinforcements had turned the area into the “epicenter” of hostilities.\n    \n\n            Russia claimed to have captured several Ukrainian positions near the city of Kharkiv in recent weeks, with the eventual goal of capturing the city for a second time. \n    \n\n            A Kremlin spokesman has attributed the biggest drone assault on Russian territory since the war in Ukraine began to the “continued terrorist activity of the Kyiv regime.” \n    \n\n            The Russian President Vladimir Putin is receiving “timely and up-to-date information” on all developments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday. \n    \n\n        “Of course, with regard to such massive attacks, the information is also immediately brought to the attention of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief [Vladimir Putin],” Peskov added.\n    \n\n            Journalists on the regular Kremlin call pressed P...[Content truncated]",

We review these data and highlight the limitations of international governance for protection of the environment during armed conflict and for accountability for those directly responsible for environmental damage.\nWe performed an integrative review of academic, institutional, and media information resources on the environmental health impacts of Russia’s war in Ukraine. We conducted a search for combinations of the search terms “Ukraine”, “Russia”, “war”, “environment”, “health”, “human rights”, and “international humanitarian law” on PubMed and Google. We also searched the HeinOnline Law Journal Library and EJIL:Talk! Blog of the European Journal of International Law, using combinations of the search terms “ecocide”, “international humanitarian law”, “environment”, “international human rights law”, and “war crimes”. We limited searches to articles in English and Ukrainian. We then reviewed the titles of the identified articles for topical relevance. In addition, we drew on our participation in the NATO Science and Peace for Security Advanced Research Workshop on Health and Environment in Conflict Zones (SPS.ARW.G5432), held in Kyiv, Ukraine, in 2018 (DH, MP, OK, NB, AH, TE) and in the NATO Science and Peace for Security Advanced Research Workshop on Chemical, Biologic, Radiologic, and Nuclear Agents (SPS.ATC.G5663), held in Dnipro, Ukraine, in 2019 (DH, MP, OK, TE).\nBy October 2023, nearly 500,000 Ukrainian and Russian military personnel had been killed or wounded during the war [1], and 30,000 civilians had been killed or injured, according to the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights [2]. In addition, indirect health effects of the war have likely accounted for an even greater amount of civilian morbidity and mortality due to malnutrition, communicable diseases, exacerbation of noncommunicable diseases, maternal and infant disorders, and mental and behavioral disorders. These indirect health effects of war are primarily caused by forced displacement and damage to civilian infrastructure. In November 2023, UNHCR: The United Nations Refugee Agency reported that nearly 6.3 million Ukrainians had become refugees, 5.0 million had been internally displaced, and over 17 million needed humanitarian assistance [3]. Russia’s military forces have caused extensive damage to civilian infrastructure for healthcare, agriculture and food supply, water and sanitation, energy, transportation, and communication. In addition, the war has had a devastating impact on Ukraine’s economy and has adversely affected food and energy security in many countries.\nThe Kyiv School of Economics estimated that, as of April 2023, the direct documented damages...[Content truncated]",

            "content": "[Content truncated].... Six Russian regions including Moscow came under attack early Wednesday, while in the city of Pskov, near the Estonian border, several transport planes were reportedly damaged when drones targeted an airport. Russian officials haven’t reported any casualties, and claimed to have thwarted almost all of the strikes.\n    \n\n            Ukraine has increasingly been emboldened to hit strategic targets inside Russia through the air in recent weeks, even as it suffers assaults on its own cities, setting up a new phase of the conflict defined by Kyiv’s apparent efforts to wear down domestic Russian support for the war.\n    \n\n            Kyiv officials meanwhile said Russia hit the Ukrainian capital with a “massive” bombardment overnight. \n    \n\nCNN’s Rob Picheta, Anna Chernova and Gul Tuysuz contributed reporting to this post.\n\n\n            The northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv has set up 60 classrooms in its subway ahead of the start of the school year in September, the mayor said in a statement.\n    \n\n            Kharkiv, which lies roughly 20 miles from the Russian border, was occupied by Russian forces in the early months of the war. Ukraine managed to liberate the city in September last year — but Russian forces have since tried to recapture the city, which has come under frequent bombardment for much of this summer.\n    \n\n            The underground classrooms will accommodate around 1,000 students, with plans to set up even more classrooms to allow for safe in-person education several days a week, Kharkiv mayor Ihor Terekhov said.\n    \n\n            The city’s subways were the main shelter for its residents during intense Russian bombardment in the first few months of the war.\n    \n\n            Ukraine ordered mandatory evacuations in Kharkiv region earlier this month, after a local Ukrainian official said that substantial reinforcements had turned the area into the “epicenter” of hostilities.\n    \n\n            Russia claimed to have captured several Ukrainian positions near the city of Kharkiv in recent weeks, with the eventual goal of capturing the city for a second time. \n    \n\n            A Kremlin spokesman has attributed the biggest drone assault on Russian territory since the war in Ukraine began to the “continued terrorist activity of the Kyiv regime.” \n    \n\n            The Russian President Vladimir Putin is receiving “timely and up-to-date information” on all developments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday. \n    \n\n        “Of course, with regard to such massive attacks, the information is also immediately brought to the attention of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief [Vladimir Putin],” Peskov added.\n    \n\n            Journalists on the regular Kremlin call pressed P...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "Does video evidence of a beach party in Kyiv reflect the current war situation?",
        "Answer": "The video evidence of a beach party in Kyiv cannot be taken as a reflection of the current war situation in Ukraine. Here are the reasons: 1. **Geographic Context**: The video shows a beach party in Kyiv, which is situated far from the frontline of the ongoing conflict, primarily located in the eastern regions of Ukraine. The presence of leisure activities in the capital does not negate the existence of the war. The Associated Press stated, 'The video does show partygoers at a beach club in Kyiv, but it doesn’t prove the war is fictitious'. Despite the leisure atmosphere depicted in the video, the war's impact continues to be felt in different parts of the country. 2. **Ongoing Military Activity**: Reports indicate that Ukraine continues to face significant military threats from Russia, with attacks on the capital and other regions. For instance, on August 30, 2023, it was reported that 'Russia hit the Ukrainian capital with a ‘massive’ bombardment overnight'. This indicates that while some areas might seem peaceful or normal, the country as a whole is still embroiled in an active conflict. 3. **Misinformation and Misinterpretation**: The video has been shared widely to downplay the war's seriousness, or even suggest that the war is 'fake.' Misusing such footage to trivialize the impact of the conflict can create a misleading narrative about the situation in Ukraine. As noted, 'social media users are sharing a video of young people partying... to downplay the impact of Russia’s invasion'. This highlights how such videos can be misconstrued or manipulated in discourse surrounding the war. Based on the evaluation of the evidence and the reasoning presented, I am confident at 85% in my conclusion that the video evidence does not accurately reflect the current war situation in Ukraine. The leisure activities depicted do not provide a complete or accurate context of the ongoing conflict.",
