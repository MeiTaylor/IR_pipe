Six Russian regions including Moscow came under attack early Wednesday, while in the city of Pskov, near the Estonian border, several transport planes were reportedly damaged when drones targeted an airport. Russian officials haven\u2019t reported any casualties, and claimed to have thwarted almost all of the strikes.\n    \n\n            Ukraine has increasingly been emboldened to hit strategic targets inside Russia through the air in recent weeks, even as it suffers assaults on its own cities, setting up a new phase of the conflict defined by Kyiv\u2019s apparent efforts to wear down domestic Russian support for the war.\n    \n\n            Kyiv officials meanwhile said Russia hit the Ukrainian capital with a \u201cmassive\u201d bombardment overnight.\u00a0\n    \n\nCNN\u2019s Rob Picheta, Anna Chernova and Gul Tuysuz contributed reporting to this post.\n\n\n            The northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv has set up 60 classrooms in its subway ahead of the start of the school year in September, the mayor said in a statement.\n    \n\n            Kharkiv, which lies roughly 20 miles from the Russian border, was occupied by Russian forces in the early months of the war. Ukraine managed to liberate the city in September last year \u2014 but Russian forces have since tried to recapture the city, which has come under frequent bombardment for much of this summer.\n    \n\n            The underground classrooms will accommodate around 1,000 students, with plans to set up even more classrooms to allow for safe in-person education several days a week, Kharkiv mayor Ihor Terekhov said.\n    \n\n            The city\u2019s subways were the main shelter for its residents during intense Russian bombardment in the first few months of the war.\n    \n\n            Ukraine ordered mandatory evacuations in Kharkiv region earlier this month, after a local Ukrainian official said that substantial reinforcements had turned the area into the \u201cepicenter\u201d of hostilities.\n    \n\n            Russia claimed to have captured several Ukrainian positions near the city of Kharkiv in recent weeks, with the eventual goal of capturing the city for a second time. \n    \n\n            A Kremlin spokesman has attributed the biggest drone assault on Russian territory since the war in Ukraine began to the \u201ccontinued terrorist activity of the Kyiv regime.\u201d \n    \n\n            The Russian President Vladimir Putin is receiving \u201ctimely and up-to-date information\u201d on all developments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday. \n    \n\n        \u201cOf course, with regard to such massive attacks, the information is also immediately brought to the attention of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief [Vladimir Putin],\u201d Peskov added.\n    \n\n            Journalists on the regular Kremlin call pressed P...[Content truncated]",

A year ago, this segment of society might have chosen to hide from reality. Today it is living in an artificial world in which the Russian nation is carrying out a messianic mission and defending itself from the West that seeks to destroy it.\n1Andrei Kolesnikov, \u201cWait and See: How Ordinary Russians Are Adapting to the New Reality,\u201d Carnegie Politika, August 4, 2023, https://carnegieendowment.org/politika/90327.\n2Denis Volkov and Andrei Kolesnikov, \u201cMy Country, Right or Wrong: Russian Public Opinion on Ukraine,\u201d Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, September 7, 2022, https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/09/07/my-country-right-or-wrong-russian-public-opinion-on-ukraine-pub-87803.\n3The average total numbers of \u201cdefinitely support\u201d and \u201cmostly support\u201d answers are recorded in this Levada Center poll: \u201cConflict With Ukraine: Review at the End of August 2023\u201d [in Russian], published September 5, 2023, https://www.levada.ru/2023/09/05/konflikt-s-ukrainoj-otsenki-kontsa-avgusta-2023-goda/.\n4We wrote about this last year, and the situation has changed little since then.
