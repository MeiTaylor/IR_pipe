The video does show partygoers at a beach club in Kyiv, but it doesn’t prove the war is fictitious. The front line of the war is in the eastern part of the country, far from Ukraine’s capital city. But that has not spared the capital, which has regularly been attacked by Russia with missiles and drones.\nTHE FACTS: Social media users are sharing a video of young people partying by a pool in Kyiv to downplay the impact of Russia’s invasion, going so far in some posts to suggest the war isn’t real.\n“The war in Ukraine is FAKE,” reads a post sharing the video on the platform X, formerly known as Twitter.\n“How are your US taxpayer money is working out for the war in Ukraine? Footage from a beach club in Kiev during the war,” reads another post on X with the same video.\nWhile the video was taken recently at a beach club in Kyiv, it’s not proof that the war is “fake.”\nThe video was originally posted Sunday on TikTok by a user who goes by zhadyft.

A protracted conflict, as perverse as it might seem, has some potential upsides for the United States (Table 3). While the war continues, Russian forces will remain preoccupied with Ukraine and thus not have the bandwidth to menace others. A longer war would further degrade the Russian military and weaken the Russian economy. But the war has already been so devastating to Russian power that further incremental weakening is arguably no longer as significant a benefit for U.S. interests as in the earlier phases of the conflict. It will take years, perhaps even decades, for the Russian military and economy to recover from the damage already incurred.\n### **Table 3.** Potential Benefits of a Long War for the United States\n|  | Benefit | Explanation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Highly significant benefits | blank | blank |\n| Moderately significant benefits | Russia will be further weakened. | Russia has already been significantly weakened by the war, so the United States would only see moderate benefits from further weakening its adversary. |\n| Less significant benefits | Greater Ukrainian territorial control is possible. | Benefits of greater Ukrainian territorial control are moderately or less significant (see Table 1). |\n| Russia's ability to menace others is limited while the war is ongoing. | As long as the fighting continues, the Russian military and its leaders will have much less bandwidth to intervene elsewhere. |\n| Allies may further reduce energy dependence on Russia and increase spending on their own defense. | The trends appear to be well established already. |\nNOTE: Our weighting, detailed in the text, combines an assessment of consequences of an outcome to the United States and the likelihood of an outcome occurring.\nA long war would also maintain pressure on European governments to continue to reduce energy dependence on Russia and spend more on their defense, possibly lessening the U.S. defense burden in Europe over the long run. Here too, however, it is likely that European countries will maintain these policies regardless of how much longer the war lasts.\nYet there are significant downsides of a long war for U.S. interests (Table 4). A longer war will lead to further loss of life, displacement, and suffering for Ukrainian civilians; minimizing these humanitarian consequences for Ukraine is a U.S. interest. Continued conflict also leaves open the possibility that Russia will reverse Ukrainian battlefield gains made in fall ...[Content truncated]",

It’s not a movie | Opinion\n=================================================================================\n### Share this:\n*   \n*   \n!\nSpecial to the Sun Sentinel\nKristina Fialko was born in Kyiv, Ukraine and now studies in Chicago.\n!\nBy \nUPDATED: March 15, 2022 at 7:00 p.m.\nLike you, I’ve been watching a war.\nThis consists of refreshing Telegram and Twitter every few seconds for updates from friends, family, journalists and observers on the ground in Ukraine, trying to sift through what’s real and what’s disinformation while desperately searching for reassurances that loved ones are not harmed.\nI was born in Kyiv and moved to America with my parents when I was a child.

For many others, however, this may be the first time they are paying attention to Ukraine and its people.\nA common refrain that has captivated public attention in these early days of the war is the pride and defiance of Ukrainians against Russian invaders. Viral videos depict a Ukrainian woman confronting enemy soldiers, telling them to put seeds in their pockets so flowers may grow when they die on our soil, a Ukrainian man carrying a land mine in his bare hands, Ukrainian citizens gathering weapons and preparing Molotov cocktails to defend their cities.\nThe...[Content truncated]",

We review these data and highlight the limitations of international governance for protection of the environment during armed conflict and for accountability for those directly responsible for environmental damage.\nWe performed an integrative review of academic, institutional, and media information resources on the environmental health impacts of Russia’s war in Ukraine. We conducted a search for combinations of the search terms “Ukraine”, “Russia”, “war”, “environment”, “health”, “human rights”, and “international humanitarian law” on PubMed and Google. We also searched the HeinOnline Law Journal Library and EJIL:Talk! Blog of the European Journal of International Law, using combinations of the search terms “ecocide”, “international humanitarian law”, “environment”, “international human rights law”, and “war crimes”. We limited searches to articles in English and Ukrainian. We then reviewed the titles of the identified articles for topical relevance. In addition, we drew on our participation in the NATO Science and Peace for Security Advanced Research Workshop on Health and Environment in Conflict Zones (SPS.ARW.G5432), held in Kyiv, Ukraine, in 2018 (DH, MP, OK, NB, AH, TE) and in the NATO Science and Peace for Security Advanced Research Workshop on Chemical, Biologic, Radiologic, and Nuclear Agents (SPS.ATC.G5663), held in Dnipro, Ukraine, in 2019 (DH, MP, OK, TE).\nBy October 2023, nearly 500,000 Ukrainian and Russian military personnel had been killed or wounded during the war [1], and 30,000 civilians had been killed or injured, according to the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights [2]. In addition, indirect health effects of the war have likely accounted for an even greater amount of civilian morbidity and mortality due to malnutrition, communicable diseases, exacerbation of noncommunicable diseases, maternal and infant disorders, and mental and behavioral disorders. These indirect health effects of war are primarily caused by forced displacement and damage to civilian infrastructure. In November 2023, UNHCR: The United Nations Refugee Agency reported that nearly 6.3 million Ukrainians had become refugees, 5.0 million had been internally displaced, and over 17 million needed humanitarian assistance [3]. Russia’s military forces have caused extensive damage to civilian infrastructure for healthcare, agriculture and food supply, water and sanitation, energy, transportation, and communication. In addition, the war has had a devastating impact on Ukraine’s economy and has adversely affected food and energy security in many countries.\nThe Kyiv School of Economics estimated that, as of April 2023, the direct documented damages...[Content truncated]",

These were the first victims of the Holocaust.\nThey were not transported by trains to the famous killing sites in Poland, with their gas chambers and crematoria that typically characterize the Holocaust in the minds of most people. Instead, these Holocaust victims were taken from their homes, usually by foot, to the outskirts of the cities, towns, and villages where they lived and were brutally shot—face to face or in the back—often in the presence of local residents and non-Jewish neighbors.\nThe mass shooting of Jewish victims in the summer and fall of 1941 represents the first phase of the Holocaust, often referred to by historians as “the Holocaust by bullets.” It was during this initial phase that special German killing squads (_Einsatzkommandos_) coordinated the mass murder of Jews by bullets with the help of the SS, _Wehrmacht_ troops, the Romanian military, special “operational squadrons,” order police units, and local collaborators.\nNazi Extermination Policy on the Eve of Barbarossa\n--------------------------------------------------\nBefore World War II, the 1.5 million Jews living in the Soviet republic of Ukraine constituted the largest Jewish population within the Soviet Union, and one of the largest Jewish populations in Europe. Between 1939 and 1941, when Stalin occupied Galicia, western Volhynia, northern Bukovina, and southern Bessarabia (see map below), the number of Jews in the Ukrainian Soviet Republic (UkrSSR) rose to 2.45 million people, increasing the percentage of Jews from five to six percent.\n!\nMap of present-day Ukrainian oblasts, or administrative districts.

This policy was outlined by Hitler on June 6, 1941, in a directive known as the Commissar Order, and demanded the swift execution of suspected political leaders.

It was a retreat which unfolded one day at a time within a web of perplexing uncertainties.\n!\nMonument to the Mother Land in Kyiv\nEven in this time of war, Kyiv itself remains a vibrant European city that is learning to carry on its daily life - eerily undaunted - while still under daily missile attacks. It was a bizarre experience to sit in the midst of a globally live-streamed war, unfolding in real time, while still feeling safe enough to join with the crowds wandering freely through the city. Such is the nature of modern, high-tech warfare. Our two Ukrainian retreat participants, Vasyl Grynevych and Valta Pashkovsky, were equipped with cell phone apps that alerted us to missile attacks the moment any missiles passed into Ukrainian air space, well before the missiles arrived. These attacks usually took place in the middle of the night. But since the missiles and drones were almost always shot down before they reached the city by Ukrainian Air Defense systems, and we were in an area not likely to be targeted, the choice most often was simply to ignore the air raid sirens, and to sleep in interior rooms away from exterior windows and glass.\n!\nMaidan Square in Kyiv\nThe cumulative fear and psychological stress of living in these circumstances was never far below the surface. We visited Maidan Square, where an ongoing vigil is taking place, filling the central square with thousands of Ukrainian flags, each bearing the name of a soldier or civilian killed in this war. Vasyl himself had been present during the 2014  here, when 150 demonstrators lost their lives. His stories from that event, and the memorial offerings accumulating from the current war, brought it all closer to home for us.\nIt seemed that everyone we talked to knew someone who had died, or was locked in the quagmire of trench warfare on the front lines. Valta and Vasyl are anticipating their own call to service, a call that could come at any time. Everyone was touched by the trauma of this war. Valta and Vasyl’s presence in our peace vigil added essential local knowledge and experience, giving our retreat a more heightened sense of purpose and immediacy.\n!\nDobek, Vasyl, Valta, Szymon, Kurt & Kyosan\nThroughout the week, we observed a Zen retreat schedule, rising at 4:00 AM each morning, and sitting mostly in silence for periods throughout the day until late evening.
