        "Question": "Does the video show Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin drinking during the event?",
        "Answer": "Based on the information provided in the claim and the video description, the video does **not** show Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin actually drinking during the event. The claim specifically mentions that they toast each other and then place their drinks on the table without consuming them. The video description also indicates that while both men are holding glasses of wine and engaging in speeches and gestures, there is no indication that they actually drink from their glasses. From this analysis, we can conclude that: - The claim states they toast but do not drink. - The video description supports this claim by focusing on formal interactions without depicting any actual drinking.",
