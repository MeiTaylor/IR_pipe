    "Video_information": {
        "Video_description_from_descriptor": "The video opens with a man in a black suit standing at a podium, holding a glass of wine, and appearing to deliver a speech or presentation in a formal setting with blue curtains in the background. The focus then shifts to another man in a suit standing at a table, also holding a glass of wine and giving a speech at the same event. Throughout the video, the man in the black suit with the wine glass remains the central figure, although both men are speaking. The scenes depict interactions between the individuals, highlighting moments of toasting and gestures with the glasses of wine. The setting suggests a formal event or ceremony, with microphone setups on the tables indicating a structured gathering. The key frames capture various interactions between the two men, showcasing subtle moments of trust issues or skepticism humorously referenced in the captions. These moments include both men holding glasses of what is presumed to be champagne, engaging in dialogue or gestures, and maintaining a serious demeanor. The occurrences culminate with the man in the black suit finishing his speech, implying a conclusion to the event or presentation. Overall, the video portrays a sequence of formal interactions and speeches at an organized function, emphasizing the dynamic between the two suited men through moments of raising glasses and engaging in speech delivery."

    "CVResult": {
        "Judgment": "Yes",
        "Confidence": "95%",
        "Reason": "The existing information is sufficient to determine the truthfulness of the claim. The claim clearly states that Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin toast each other but do not drink from their glasses, instead placing them on the table. The video description supports this by indicating that both men are holding glasses of wine and engaging in gestures, but it does not provide any evidence of them actually consuming the drinks. The analysis of the QA_CONTEXTS explicitly confirms this by stating that while they toast and hold glasses, there is no indication of actual drinking. Given this strong alignment between the claim and the video description, along with the clear interpretation that they place their drinks on the table without consuming them, we can conclude that the claim is truthful with high reliability."
