Our design concept for the first Manhattan location—a three-level destination featuring thermal pools, saunas, and marble hammams—was inspired by the idea of the Hero’s Journey. Our goal was to create a new architectural language, allowing guests to feel as though they’ve discovered a slightly futuristic ruin from an ancient civilization.\nAnswering the call to adventure.\n--------------------------------\n!\nAt reception, portals of fluted glass emphasize the guests’ journey to come.\n!\nGuests descend a black stair to a vestibule with a mural by Dean Barger, one of many thresholds.\n!\nBlack, mirrored portals create rhythm in the locker rooms.\n!\nGuests begin on the ground floor and descend down two subterranean levels, passing through a series of portals in a dream-like environment.\n!\nSix pools in a range of temperatures are lit in different tones (cooler to warmer).\n!\nGlowing fields of colored lights ascend to unknown depths above the pools.\n!\nAs guests emerge from the locker rooms, they enter the lounge and café for a moment of reprieve.\nA ceremonial sauna is lined in cedar with an altar-like central heater. Sauna Masters perform Aufguss, a sensory experience with scented oils, music, and, of course, heat.\n!\n!\nThe steam room is clad in Danish three-dimensional tile with strips of light for a mysterious focal point.\n!\nInner sanctum\n-------------\n* * *\nA darkened, compressed corridor evokes a sense of anticipation on the way to the treatment rooms.

World Heritage Site in 1987, largely because of its architectural history and the way in which the city landscape draws together public and private buildings and spaces. The many examples of Palladian architecture are purposefully integrated with the urban spaces to provide \"picturesque aestheticism\". In 2021, the city was added to a second World Heritage Site, a group of historic spa towns across Europe known as the \"Great Spas of Europe\". Bath is the only entire city in Britain to achieve World Heritage status, and is a popular tourist destination.\nImportant buildings include the Roman Baths; neoclassical architect Robert Adam's Pulteney Bridge, based on an unused design for the Rialto Bridge in Venice; and Bath Abbey in the city centre, founded in 1499 on the site of an 8th-century church. Of equal importance are the residential buildings designed and built into boulevards and crescents by the Georgian architects John Wood, the Elder and his son John Wood, the Younger – well-known examples being the Royal Crescent, built around 1770, and The Circus, built around 1760, where each of the three curved segments faces one of the entrances, ensuring that there is always a classical facade facing the entering visitor.\nMost of Bath's buildings are made from the local, golden-coloured, Bath Stone. The dominant architectural style is Georgian, which evolved from the Palladian revival style that became popular in the early 18th century. The city became a fashionable and popular spa and social centre during the 18th century. Based initially around its hot springs, this led to a demand for substantial homes and guest houses. The key architects, John Wood and his son, laid out many of the city's present-day squares and crescents within a green valley and the surrounding hills. According to UNESCO this provided... \"an integration of architecture, urban design, and landscape setting, and the deliberate creation of a beautiful city\". Development during modern eras, including the development of the transport infrastructure and rebuilding after bomb damage during World War II, has mostly been in keeping with earlier styles to maintain the integrated cityscape.\nCeltic, Roman and Saxon\nThe Great Bath at the Roman Baths. The entire structure above the level of the pillar bases is a later construction.\nBuildings from Bath's pre-Norman period either no longer exist, or their remains are below street level.

One of the most striking features of the building’s design was its graceful, concrete-domed colonnade which lead visitors diagonally to the Bathhouse.\nThe Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians who own the property, announced plans to demolish the Spa Bathhouse and Hotel in its entirety and PS ModCom established a dialog and presented a case for restoration instead. In the midst of these discussions the Tribe demolished the buildings in June 2014.\nImages © J. PAUL GETTY TRUST. USED WITH  \nPERMISSION.

In addition, the funding for the new building was approved by the California State Allocation Board.\nThe Administration Building was a fine example of mid-century modern design with few alterations. Its demolition versus implementing an adaptive reuse as a portion of a performing arts building is tragic and disturbing.\n!\nImages © Dan Chavkin\n### Chart House, Rancho Mirage\n#### Arson 2012, Demolished 2013\nOn February 7, 2013 the Rancho Mirage City Council denied the Palm Springs Modern Committee’s appeal of the City’s order to demolish the Chart House restaurant, which had been damaged by fire in...[Content truncated]",
