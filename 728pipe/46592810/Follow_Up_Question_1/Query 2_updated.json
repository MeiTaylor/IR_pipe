However, it could be reported in a de-identified data set as \u201c2009\u201d.\nMany records contain dates of service or other events that imply age.\u00a0 Ages that are explicitly stated, or implied, as over 89 years old must be recoded as 90 or above.\u00a0 For example, if the patient\u2019s year of birth is 1910 and the year of healthcare service is reported as 2010, then in the de-identified data set the year of birth should be reported as \u201con or before 1920.\u201d\u00a0 Otherwise, a recipient of the data set would learn that the age of the patient is approximately 100.\nCan dates associated with test measures for a patient be reported in accordance with Safe Harbor?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNo. Dates associated with test measures, such as those derived from a laboratory report, are directly related to a specific individual and relate to the provision of health care.

It represents a melding of the \nFrench, Spanish and Caribbean architectural influences in conjunction with the \ndemands of the hot, humid climate of New Orleans. As the aesthetics of American \narchitecture were accepted within the Creole population, the style died out in \nfavor of more fashionable styles. \nHallmarks of the Creole style include simplicity, brick, stucco or weatherboard \nexterior walls, large six over six windows, French doors, no dominant entrances \nand shutters attached with strap hinges on all windows and doors. In 2-story \nCreole townhouses or mixed use buildings, fanlights above ground floor windows \noften open to provide ventilation and can provide illumination to an entresol or \nmezzanine. Unroofed second floor galleries with wrought iron railings were often \nadded after 1850. \nIt is unusual to find buildings where the Creole style is liberally mixed with another \narchitectural style. Most frequently, one might find a Creole style building that \nhas been modified by placing Italianate brackets under galleries or roof overhangs. \n# Architectural Styles \nCreole townhouses often include a carriage way as seen on \nthe left instead of a prominent entrance door.
