Only two, who were older, had any massage experience, he said. Most of the girls were younger than 18.\n\"Each of the victims that went to the home were asked to bring their friends to the home. Some complied and some didn\u2019t,\" Recarey said.\nThe descriptions of how women were recruited contained in the documents is consistent with what was testified to at Maxwell\u2019s criminal trial.\u00a0Nineteen exhibits totaling 327 pages of previously sealed documents were released...[Content truncated]",

Stewart\nAlmost exactly a year ago, on Aug. 16, 2018, I visited Jeffrey Epstein at his cavernous Manhattan mansion.\nThe overriding impression I took away from our roughly 90-minute conversation was that Mr. Epstein knew an astonishing number of rich, famous and powerful people, and had photos to prove it. He also claimed to know a great deal about these people, some of it potentially damaging or embarrassing, including details about their supposed sexual proclivities and recreational drug use.\nSo one of my first thoughts on hearing of Mr. Epstein\u2019s suicide was that many prominent men and at least a few women must be breathing sighs of relief that whatever Mr. Epstein knew, he has taken it with him.\n[The Latest: Lawsuit claims Mr. Epstein trafficked girls in Caribbean until 2018.]\nDuring our conversation, Mr. Epstein made no secret of his own scandalous past \u2014 he\u2019d pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting prostitution from underage girls and was a registered sex offender \u2014 and acknowledged to me that he was a pariah in polite society. At the same time, he seemed unapologetic. His very notoriety, he said, was what made so many people willing to confide in him. Everyone, he suggested, has secrets and, he added, compared with his own, they seemed innocuous. People confided in him without feeling awkward or embarrassed, he claimed.\nI\u2019d never met Mr. Epstein before. I had contacted him because my colleagues and I had heard a rumor that he was advising Tesla\u2019s embattled chief executive, Elon Musk, who was in trouble after announcing on Twitter that he had lined up the funding to take Tesla private.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission began an investigation into Mr. Musk\u2019s remarks, which moved markets but didn\u2019t appear to have much basis in fact. There were calls for Mr. Musk to relinquish his position as Tesla\u2019s chairman and for Tesla to recruit more independent directors. I\u2019d heard that Mr. Epstein was compiling a list of candidates at Mr. Musk\u2019s behest \u2014 and that Mr. Epstein had an email from Mr. Musk authorizing the search for a new chairman.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease...[Content truncated]",

When they examined the patients, their apprehensions were deepened by the varied symptoms they encountered: most reported fatigue and muscle or joint pain, but some also experienced light sensitivity, hair loss, and anomic aphasia\u2014difficulty recalling words and phrases. \u201cThe whole situation was bizarre,\u201d Kaplan told Johnson, years later. \u201cI mean, here you have this exceptionally beautiful place with weird people and weird doctors and a weird medical problem\u2014the whole thing was weird.\u201d Holmes described the situation to Johnson as \u201ctwo doctors isolated in a mountainous area who had worked themselves into a frenzy.\u201d\nWhen the doctors set up interviews with Kaplan and Holmes and their sickest patients, the conversations only reinforced the investigators\u2019 skepticism. Peterson and Cheney were ebullient to finally have the chance to show this flummoxing condition to highly trained epidemiologists; to Kaplan and Holmes, it felt as though they were being aggressively lobbied to believe in a strange new disease. Kaplan later confessed to Johnson that he suspected a kind of \u201ccollusion\u201d between the doctors and patients. The pair left Incline with a sense that the epidemic was exaggerated. They believed that, at most, it was a set of disparate symptoms haphazardly lumped together. At times, they seemed to imply that it was a sort of mass folie \u00e0 deux\u2014a shared delusion. (There are documented cases of group psychogenic illness. In 2011, some twenty girls at a high school in Le Roy, New York, simultaneously developed a condition that caused them to stutter and twitch uncontrollably, and which seemed to have no biological cause. In the past few years, hundreds of refugee children in Sweden have fallen into  after being informed that their families would be deported.) Peterson had considered the possibility of psychosomatic illness but felt it improbable, because many of the patients were otherwise well-adjusted, with no history of mental instability or trauma. \u201cI\u2019d seen almost all these people for three years when they were well,\u201d he told me. Any psychological theory just \u201cwasn\u2019t right.\u201d\nIn May, 1986, Kaplan and Holmes published their findings in a weekly C.D.C. digest. (Holmes declined to be interviewed for this story, and Kaplan couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.) The brief article, titled \u201cChronic Fatigue Possibly Related to Epstein-Barr Virus - Nevada,\u201d advised doctors to make a diagnosis of chronic Epstein-Barr virus\u2014the C.D.C. didn\u2019t adopt the name \u201cchronic-fatigue syndrome\u201d for another two years\u2014only at the exclusion of all other possible diseases. The article acknowledged that the patients had unusually high Epstein-Barr antibodies in their blood but noted that these proteins could sometimes be found at similar levels...[Content truncated]",

What life is like as a working mom dealing with the fallout\n==========================================================================================================================\nBY\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \nMy name is Erin, and I don\u2019t have Long COVID.\nI\u2019m not sure how I would know if I did.\nTwenty-five years ago, in junior high, I came down with mono as it circulated through my social circle. Mononucleosis\u2014known as the \u201ckissing disease\u201d because it can be spread by saliva\u2014is an infection caused by the herpes virus Epstein-Barr. It can also be passed on via coughs and sneezes, and sharing drinks and food.\nNot surprisingly, it\u2019s common among teens and young adults.\nMore than anything, mono exhausted me, and kept exhausting me\u2014long after the infection was over. Getting out of bed felt like a herculean task. Every morning I found myself sick, in pain, and burdened by some invisible weight I couldn\u2019t quite describe. But I looked fine. And after the acute phase of mono, no one really believed me.\nMy friends with mono bounced back within days or weeks. But me? Flash forward to high school\u2014usually a star student and teacher\u2019s pet, I was failing and enrolled in night school with other so-called troublemakers because I was exhausted and couldn\u2019t pry myself out of bed before 10 a.m.\nThe accusations of laziness and resulting shame were real. But the symptoms, as nebulous as they were, were even more so. I felt like I was living in an alternate reality, suffering in some invisible hell no one else could see or understand. My symptoms and character were regularly called into question.\nEventually I received a diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, a disorder involving extreme fatigue for six months or more that can\u2019t be explained otherwise, and which rest doesn\u2019t help.  may involve aches and pains, temper lymph nodes, digestive issues, chills and sweats, muscle weakness, shortness of breath, brain fog, and an irregular heartbeat.\nSounds a little like Long COVID, huh?\nThere was no treatment, I was told, and left to soldier on as if nothing was happening, for fear I\u2019d be accused of being slovenly yet again. Mentally, I struggled with the weight of others\u2019 judgements. I was raised by Midwestern Boomers\u2014lethargy was a sin, and so, I sloughed on. But...[Content truncated]",
