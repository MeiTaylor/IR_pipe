Stewart\nAlmost exactly a year ago, on Aug. 16, 2018, I visited Jeffrey Epstein at his cavernous Manhattan mansion.\nThe overriding impression I took away from our roughly 90-minute conversation was that Mr. Epstein knew an astonishing number of rich, famous and powerful people, and had photos to prove it. He also claimed to know a great deal about these people, some of it potentially damaging or embarrassing, including details about their supposed sexual proclivities and recreational drug use.\nSo one of my first thoughts on hearing of Mr. Epstein’s suicide was that many prominent men and at least a few women must be breathing sighs of relief that whatever Mr. Epstein knew, he has taken it with him.\n[The Latest: Lawsuit claims Mr. Epstein trafficked girls in Caribbean until 2018.]\nDuring our conversation, Mr. Epstein made no secret of his own scandalous past — he’d pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting prostitution from underage girls and was a registered sex offender — and acknowledged to me that he was a pariah in polite society. At the same time, he seemed unapologetic. His very notoriety, he said, was what made so many people willing to confide in him. Everyone, he suggested, has secrets and, he added, compared with his own, they seemed innocuous. People confided in him without feeling awkward or embarrassed, he claimed.\nI’d never met Mr. Epstein before. I had contacted him because my colleagues and I had heard a rumor that he was advising Tesla’s embattled chief executive, Elon Musk, who was in trouble after announcing on Twitter that he had lined up the funding to take Tesla private.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission began an investigation into Mr. Musk’s remarks, which moved markets but didn’t appear to have much basis in fact. There were calls for Mr. Musk to relinquish his position as Tesla’s chairman and for Tesla to recruit more independent directors. I’d heard that Mr. Epstein was compiling a list of candidates at Mr. Musk’s behest — and that Mr. Epstein had an email from Mr. Musk authorizing the search for a new chairman.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease...[Content truncated]",

When they examined the patients, their apprehensions were deepened by the varied symptoms they encountered: most reported fatigue and muscle or joint pain, but some also experienced light sensitivity, hair loss, and anomic aphasia—difficulty recalling words and phrases. “The whole situation was bizarre,” Kaplan told Johnson, years later. “I mean, here you have this exceptionally beautiful place with weird people and weird doctors and a weird medical problem—the whole thing was weird.” Holmes described the situation to Johnson as “two doctors isolated in a mountainous area who had worked themselves into a frenzy.”\nWhen the doctors set up interviews with Kaplan and Holmes and their sickest patients, the conversations only reinforced the investigators’ skepticism. Peterson and Cheney were ebullient to finally have the chance to show this flummoxing condition to highly trained epidemiologists; to Kaplan and Holmes, it felt as though they were being aggressively lobbied to believe in a strange new disease. Kaplan later confessed to Johnson that he suspected a kind of “collusion” between the doctors and patients. The pair left Incline with a sense that the epidemic was exaggerated. They believed that, at most, it was a set of disparate symptoms haphazardly lumped together. At times, they seemed to imply that it was a sort of mass folie à deux—a shared delusion. (There are documented cases of group psychogenic illness. In 2011, some twenty girls at a high school in Le Roy, New York, simultaneously developed a condition that caused them to stutter and twitch uncontrollably, and which seemed to have no biological cause. In the past few years, hundreds of refugee children in Sweden have fallen into  after being informed that their families would be deported.) Peterson had considered the possibility of psychosomatic illness but felt it improbable, because many of the patients were otherwise well-adjusted, with no history of mental instability or trauma. “I’d seen almost all these people for three years when they were well,” he told me. Any psychological theory just “wasn’t right.”\nIn May, 1986, Kaplan and Holmes published their findings in a weekly C.D.C. digest. (Holmes declined to be interviewed for this story, and Kaplan couldn’t be reached for comment.) The brief article, titled “Chronic Fatigue Possibly Related to Epstein-Barr Virus - Nevada,” advised doctors to make a diagnosis of chronic Epstein-Barr virus—the C.D.C. didn’t adopt the name “chronic-fatigue syndrome” for another two years—only at the exclusion of all other possible diseases. The article acknowledged that the patients had unusually high Epstein-Barr antibodies in their blood but noted that these proteins could sometimes be found at similar levels...[Content truncated]",

What life is like as a working mom dealing with the fallout\n==========================================================================================================================\nBY\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \nMy name is Erin, and I don’t have Long COVID.\nI’m not sure how I would know if I did.\nTwenty-five years ago, in junior high, I came down with mono as it circulated through my social circle. Mononucleosis—known as the “kissing disease” because it can be spread by saliva—is an infection caused by the herpes virus Epstein-Barr. It can also be passed on via coughs and sneezes, and sharing drinks and food.\nNot surprisingly, it’s common among teens and young adults.\nMore than anything, mono exhausted me, and kept exhausting me—long after the infection was over. Getting out of bed felt like a herculean task. Every morning I found myself sick, in pain, and burdened by some invisible weight I couldn’t quite describe. But I looked fine. And after the acute phase of mono, no one really believed me.\nMy friends with mono bounced back within days or weeks. But me? Flash forward to high school—usually a star student and teacher’s pet, I was failing and enrolled in night school with other so-called troublemakers because I was exhausted and couldn’t pry myself out of bed before 10 a.m.\nThe accusations of laziness and resulting shame were real. But the symptoms, as nebulous as they were, were even more so. I felt like I was living in an alternate reality, suffering in some invisible hell no one else could see or understand. My symptoms and character were regularly called into question.\nEventually I received a diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, a disorder involving extreme fatigue for six months or more that can’t be explained otherwise, and which rest doesn’t help.  may involve aches and pains, temper lymph nodes, digestive issues, chills and sweats, muscle weakness, shortness of breath, brain fog, and an irregular heartbeat.\nSounds a little like Long COVID, huh?\nThere was no treatment, I was told, and left to soldier on as if nothing was happening, for fear I’d be accused of being slovenly yet again. Mentally, I struggled with the weight of others’ judgements. I was raised by Midwestern Boomers—lethargy was a sin, and so, I sloughed on. But...[Content truncated]",
