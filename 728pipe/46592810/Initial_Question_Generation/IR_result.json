Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), remarks to reporters, July 9\nFlorida Circuit Judge Luis Delgado unsealed nearly 200 pages of grand jury testimony last week related to the 2006 Florida case involving disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was alleged to have raped teenage girls. In 2019, after he was charged in federal court with sex trafficking of minors, guards found Epstein dead in his cell at a federal jail in New York. Investigators said he hanged himself.\nThe documents showed that prosecutors had heard testimony about Epstein assaulting teenage girls before they cut a plea deal with him in 2008 that was kept from victims and provided for lenient work-release. “The details in the record will be outrageous to decent people,” Delgado wrote in his order. “The testimony taken by the grand jury concerns activity ranging from grossly unacceptable to rape — all of the conduct at issue is sexually deviant, disgusting, and criminal.”\nBut Donald Trump’s name never appears anywhere in the transcripts.\nThat hasn’t stopped Democrats — perhaps seeking to distract from President Biden’s travails — from suggesting on social media that there’s a disturbing connection between the former president and a sex predator.

Here's a sample:\n*   . Although there are  of the two together ( a “terrific guy” and  in the recently unsealed documents), this image of them on a plane, in particular, is fake.\n*    at a hospital recently to distract the public from the aforementioned documents. The footage was actually from 2021. ( also appeared in the newly released records.)\n*    playing with paper airplanes while sitting in front of two collapsed Jenga towers. While the painting is real, there’s no credible evidence to confirm (or disprove) Epstein owned it.\n*   . In reality, the man is Monte Lipman, the CEO of Republic Records.\n*   . No evidence connected the video to him.\n*   . There were telltale signs of the photo being fake. For instance, the faces of people in the background are deformed and Trump has only one leg.\nThink you’ve come across a fake photo or miscaptioned video involving Epstein?  for potential fact-checking.\nNot all rumors linking Epstein to former presidents are made up. For instance,  showing Trump with two of his children, Ivanka and Eric, alongside Epstein in the ‘90s is real,...[Content truncated]"

            "content": "A judge in Florida has ordered the surprise release of graphic transcripts from the state's 2006 prosecution of paedophile Jeffrey Epstein - a probe that ended with the millionaire financier receiving a legal slap on the wrist. \nEpstein cut a deal in 2008 to avoid charges of sex trafficking and rape. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and was sentenced to 13 months in prison.\nThe nearly 200 pages of documents contain details of Epstein's crimes, including first-hand accounts from victims and specifics about payoffs to underage victims.\nWhen prosecutors made that deal, they knew he had sexually assaulted teenage girls two years before, according to the transcripts.\nOn Monday, Circuit Judge Luis Delgado ordered the 16-year-old documents released, writing that \"details in the record will be outrageous to decent people\".\n\"The testimony taken by the Grand Jury concerns activity ranging from grossly unacceptable to rape — all of the conduct at issue is sexually deviant, disgusting, and criminal.\"\nReferring to Epstein as \"the most infamous pedophile in American history\", the judge added that the state's leniency in the case \"been the subject of much anger and has at times diminished the public's perception of the criminal justice system\".\n\"Epstein is indeed notorious and infamous and is widely reported to have flaunted his wealth while cavorting with politicians, billionaires, and even British Royalty,\" he continued. \n\"It is understandable that given those reports the public has a great curiosity about what was widely reported by news (agencies) as 'special treatment' regarding his prosecution.\"\nA grand jury investigation into Epstein's rape and...[Content truncated]"

    "QA": {
        "Question": "Does the video evidence convincingly connect the location to Jeffrey Epstein's island?",
        "Answer": "The video evidence does not convincingly connect the location depicted to Jeffrey Epstein's island. Here are the reasons supporting this conclusion:\n\n1. **Lack of Direct Evidence**: Multiple sources clarify that the video, which appears to show young girls playing in a house-like environment, has no definitive connection to Epstein or his island. For instance, a report indicates that a viral video claimed to show minors on Epstein's island, but no substantive evidence was provided to link it to him or his properties [Query 1_evidence_2].\n\n2. **Misleading Framing of Videos**: The video in question is characterized by the media as having been framed misleadingly in relation to Epstein, again emphasizing that it lacks credible evidence connecting it to his activities or locations [Query 1_evidence_2]. Such misattributions often arise swiftly on social media, particularly following significant news related to Epstein, suggesting a pattern of misinformation rather than reliable documentation.\n\n3. **Previous Disinformation Related to Epstein**: Historical precedents exist where evidence has been spotlighted falsely in relation to Epstein and his crimes. As detailed in another source, various misleading narratives connected to Epstein have emerged, driven by disinformation instead of factual witnessing or clear documentation [Query 1_evidence_1].\n\nGiven these points, I am confident in the assertion that the video evidence does not convincingly connect the location to Jeffrey Epstein's island.",
