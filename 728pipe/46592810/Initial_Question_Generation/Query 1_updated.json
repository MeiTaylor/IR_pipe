Stewart\nAlmost exactly a year ago, on Aug. 16, 2018, I visited Jeffrey Epstein at his cavernous Manhattan mansion.\nThe overriding impression I took away from our roughly 90-minute conversation was that Mr. Epstein knew an astonishing number of rich, famous and powerful people, and had photos to prove it. He also claimed to know a great deal about these people, some of it potentially damaging or embarrassing, including details about their supposed sexual proclivities and recreational drug use.\nSo one of my first thoughts on hearing of Mr. Epstein\u2019s suicide was that many prominent men and at least a few women must be breathing sighs of relief that whatever Mr. Epstein knew, he has taken it with him.\n[The Latest: Lawsuit claims Mr. Epstein trafficked girls in Caribbean until 2018.]\nDuring our conversation, Mr. Epstein made no secret of his own scandalous past \u2014 he\u2019d pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting prostitution from underage girls and was a registered sex offender \u2014 and acknowledged to me that he was a pariah in polite society. At the same time, he seemed unapologetic. His very notoriety, he said, was what made so many people willing to confide in him. Everyone, he suggested, has secrets and, he added, compared with his own, they seemed innocuous. People confided in him without feeling awkward or embarrassed, he claimed.\nI\u2019d never met Mr. Epstein before. I had contacted him because my colleagues and I had heard a rumor that he was advising Tesla\u2019s embattled chief executive, Elon Musk, who was in trouble after announcing on Twitter that he had lined up the funding to take Tesla private.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission began an investigation into Mr. Musk\u2019s remarks, which moved markets but didn\u2019t appear to have much basis in fact. There were calls for Mr. Musk to relinquish his position as Tesla\u2019s chairman and for Tesla to recruit more independent directors. I\u2019d heard that Mr. Epstein was compiling a list of candidates at Mr. Musk\u2019s behest \u2014 and that Mr. Epstein had an email from Mr. Musk authorizing the search for a new chairman.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease...[Content truncated]",

Here's a sample:\n*   . Although there are  of the two together ( a \u201cterrific guy\u201d and  in the recently unsealed documents), this image of them on a plane, in particular, is fake.\n*    at a hospital recently to distract the public from the aforementioned documents.

For instance, the faces of people in the background are deformed and Trump has only one leg.\nThink you\u2019ve come across a fake photo or miscaptioned video involving Epstein?  for potential fact-checking.\nNot all rumors linking Epstein to former presidents are made up. For instance,  showing Trump with two of his children, Ivanka and Eric, alongside Epstein in the \u201890s is real,...[Content truncated]",

Maxwell, 62, is serving a 20-year prison sentence after she was convicted in December 2021 of helping Epstein recruit and sexually abuse underage girls.\nMany of those whose names appear in the documents released on Wednesday aren't accused of wrongdoing or have been mentioned previously in legal proceedings or news accounts. Despite persistent assertions across social media, the documents released on Wednesday are not an Epstein \"client list.\"\nIn December, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska found no legal justification for continuing to withhold the names of as many as 175 individuals allegedly connected with Epstein, ordering the unsealing to begin from January 1.\nSome portions of the records will remain confidential, including those identifying people who were children when they were sexually abused by Epstein, who died by suicide in August 2019 in a federal prison in Manhattan as he awaited trial on sex-trafficking charges.\nWith the release of the names including a number of celebrities, a clip of comedian Gervais taking swipes at celebrities while hosting the 2020 Golden Globe Awards has been shared on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.\nAs he stood before the crowd gathered in Beverly Hills to toast TV and movie talent, five-time host Gervais said: \"In this room are some of the most important TV and film executives in the world, from all different backgrounds. But they all have one thing in common\u2014they're all terrified of Ronan Farrow. He's coming for you!\"\nFarrow,...[Content truncated]",
