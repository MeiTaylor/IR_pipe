Please support our boldly independent journalism with_  _of any size._\nFormer President Donald Trump published a video message to the people of Hawaii on Monday, using the opportunity to make political digs at President Joe Biden and voicing skepticism over any suggestion that the climate crisis was partly responsible for the devastation.\n\u201cI would like to express my sympathy and warmest regards to the people of Hawaii,\u201d , \u201cand specifically all of those who have been so gravely and irreparably hurt by the tragedy of the wildfires in Maui, something the likes of which have seldom been seen anywhere at any time.\u201d\nTrump then shifted gears, saying the catastrophe \u201cshould never have happened,\u201d that the government \u201cwas not prepared\u201d to deal with the wildfires, and claiming the aftermath \u201cis going very poorly.\u201d\nDon\u2019t miss a beat\n-----------------\nGet the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from _Truthout_.\n*   Email\\*\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   Phone\n    This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nTrump attacked Hawaii Gov. Josh Green (D), opining that he wanted \u201cto do nothing but blame \\ on global warming and other things that just popped into his head.\u201d Trump also said that Biden responded to reporters over the weekend by saying, \u201cwith a laugh and a smile\u201d that he had \u201cno comment\u201d on the situation.\nThose reporters were trying to ask Biden questions as he was entering a vehicle. In truth, Biden responded to the crisis several days ago, both in words and in action.\n### Related Story\n]\n|\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAmidst historic destruction, activists decry fossil fuels\u2019 role in \u201capocalyptic\u201d...[Content truncated]",

(Image via Getty Images)\n ! \nIf you are active on social media, you might have come across a video claiming that former President Trump visited Maui, Hawaii, after the wildfires caused massive destruction in the area. In the 1-minute video, the former President can be seen entering a building and addressing the public, as he says:\n> \u201cThese are incredible people. We met some of the survivors and family members and what they\u2019ve been through is incredible. One woman lost 10 people in her family, an incredible woman. I said, 'How did it go?' She said, 'I lost 10, 10 people.\u201d\n!\nThe video was titled:\n> \u201cA real President truly cares. Trump 2024.\u201d\nIn the video, Melania Trump can be seen accompanying the former president, along with a FEMA truck in the background. While the claims have been misguiding a lot of people, upon searching social media, similar videos existed that dated back to March 11, 2019, when the former President visited Beauregard, Alabama, after a tornado killed more than 15 people.\nHence, the claims that  visited the Maui wildfire are false, as the video is old and is being circulated with a fake title. On August 17, 2023, a video was shared , and within a short period of time, it received more than 2300 views.\nExpand Tweet\n* * *\nDonald Trump did not visit Maui after wildfires\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhile the news of Trump visiting  has been circulating with an old video, the truth is that the video was taken in 2019, when Trump visited Alabama...[Content truncated]",

Josh Green (D) spoke Friday after the governor had surveyed the destruction, and Green provided an update and assessment of the state\u2019s needs. He praised Biden on MSNBC after he signed the emergency declaration hours after Hawaii asked.\nThe president expressed support for the victims Thursday, during an event in Salt Lake City to mark the anniversary of the signing of the Pact Act, the law that provides aid to veterans exposed to \u201cburn pits\u201d and other toxic substances during their service.\n\u201cOur prayers are with the people of Hawaii, but not just our prayers \u2014 every asset we have will be available to them,\u201d Biden said last week. \u201cThey\u2019ve seen their home, their business destroyed, and some have lost loved ones. And it\u2019s not over yet.\u201d\nBut the president has come under attack for seeming to appear tone deaf while vacationing over the weekend. Biden left Washington on Friday morning for his home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., attending Mass on Saturday, and biking and visiting the beach Sunday. Otherwise, he kept out of the public eye over the weekend.\nDuring a bike ride on Sunday morning, the president was asked if he would visit Maui. He answered, \u201cWe\u2019re looking at it.\u201d\nBut later that evening, after the official numbers exceeded the 85 killed by the 2018 Camp Fire in Northern California, Biden answered \u201cno comment\u201d when asked about the death count. Biden is now facing scrutiny from numerous Republicans, including those who shared the video and argued that the president should address the loss of life.\nFormer president Donald Trump\u2019s campaign issued a video message on Monday evening, expressing sympathy for those affected while adding to the criticism of Biden\u2019s response.\n\u201cTo say no comment is oftentimes fine, but to be smiling when you say it, especially against such a tragedy as this, is absolutely horrible and unacceptable,\u201d Trump said in the message. He also went after Hawaii\u2019s governor for \u201cwanting to do nothing but blame it on global warming, and other things that just happen to pop into his head.\u201d\nThe region\u2019s remote location and the extensive scope of the destruction have made recovery a huge logistical challenge, officials say. Many Native Hawaiians and others have mobilized to deliver generators, food, clothing and other supplies to the survivors as firefighters continue to put out the blazes.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no government agency helping us \u2014 this is it,\u201d Native Hawaiian...[Content truncated]",
