(Image via Getty Images)\n ! \nIf you are active on social media, you might have come across a video claiming that former President Trump visited Maui, Hawaii, after the wildfires caused massive destruction in the area. In the 1-minute video, the former President can be seen entering a building and addressing the public, as he says:\n> “These are incredible people. We met some of the survivors and family members and what they’ve been through is incredible. One woman lost 10 people in her family, an incredible woman. I said, 'How did it go?' She said, 'I lost 10, 10 people.”\n!\nThe video was titled:\n> “A real President truly cares. Trump 2024.”\nIn the video, Melania Trump can be seen accompanying the former president, along with a FEMA truck in the background. While the claims have been misguiding a lot of people, upon searching social media, similar videos existed that dated back to March 11, 2019, when the former President visited Beauregard, Alabama, after a tornado killed more than 15 people.\nHence, the claims that  visited the Maui wildfire are false, as the video is old and is being circulated with a fake title. On August 17, 2023, a video was shared , and within a short period of time, it received more than 2300 views.\nExpand Tweet\n* * *\nDonald Trump did not visit Maui after wildfires\n-----------------------------------------------\nWhile the news of Trump visiting  has been circulating with an old video, the truth is that the video was taken in 2019, when Trump visited Alabama...[Content truncated]",

            "content": "[Content truncated]... active on social media, you might have come across a video claiming that former President Trump visited Maui, Hawaii, after the wildfires caused massive destruction in the area. In the 1-minute video, the former President can be seen entering a building and addressing the public, as he says:\n> “These are incredible people. We met some of the survivors and family members and what they’ve been through is incredible. One woman lost 10 people in her family, an incredible woman. I said, 'How did it go?' She said, 'I lost 10, 10 people.”\n!\nThe video was titled:\n> “A real President truly cares. Trump 2024.”\nIn the video, Melania Trump can be seen accompanying the former president, along with a FEMA truck in the background.

    "QA": {
        "Question": "Does the video accurately depict President Trump visiting Maui after the August 2023 wildfires?",
        "Answer": "The video does not accurately depict President Trump visiting Maui after the August 2023 wildfires. The information provided indicates that the video actually shows a past event in March 2019, during Trump's visit to Alabama after a tornado struck that area. The video was miscaptioned and falsely claimed to depict his visit to Maui after the recent wildfires. Multiple fact-checks confirm that Trump has not visited Maui following the wildfires, and the footage circulating online is an outdated clip from his 2019 trip [Query 1_evidence_1][Query 2_evidence_2]. Given the strong evidence from reputable sources confirming the misleading nature of the video and the misrepresentation of the event, I am confident in my conclusion.",
