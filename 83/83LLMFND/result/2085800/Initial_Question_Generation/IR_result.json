                "content": "[Content truncated]... true for “strong Democrats”).22\n    It certainly feels as if the vitriol and violence-mongering in U.S. politics has something to do with the recent increase in political violence. How can this discrepancy be explained?\n    People who commit political violence have aggressive personalities.23 Many who commit forms of political violence that do not include preplanning—such as most hate crimes, threats, and violence at rallies—also have poor self-control or have lowered their self-control temporarily (by drinking, for instance).24 These traits are shared across individuals who commit all forms of violence. What is unique about political violence is that it does not arise from interpersonal friction. Instead, for people with low self-control (a large pool that includes, for instance, teenage boys and anyone who has drunk in excess) and aggressive personalities (which limits that pool somewhat) to turn to violence, they need to be enraged and have that anger directed at a group of people they don’t know. They also need to believe that they will not face severe consequences or not care about consequences (because they are too impulsive to care or because they think the consequences are worth it).\n    In moments of low political polarization, aggressive people whose impulse control is low are likely to focus most of their rage on personal interactions: domestic violence, road rage, violent crime, or even a school or workplace shooting. Some may commit hate crimes if they are prejudiced and come across a member of a minority group. Those experiencing psychosis or using particular drugs that create illusions of grandeur may direct anger toward political figures, but they are more likely to focus that desire for a sense of importance on a nearer target, such as their school or workplace. Only an insignificant number will act; most pose greater harm to themselves. In other words, in a low-polarization environment, aggressive, impulsive individuals who don’t fear consequences may commit violence, but the targets will largely be apolitical. Meanwhile, violence is likely to be lower because people are facing only self-generated rage, not an additional level of anger and grievance projected toward people outside their personal interactions.\n    However, as partisan leaders and media personalities demonize the other party, they can create feelings of rage among followers who fear the consequences of the other party’s perceived actions. Dehumanizing and denigrating rhetoric that normalizes violence or threats against some groups turns that sense of fear and anger into a target by making certain groups appear to be both threatening and, at the same time, vulnerable.25 Finally, the normalization of violence by political leaders, in particular, may provide a sense that acting violently against those groups will be permitted, may not be punished, or could be lauded and turn one into a hero (such as how Kyle Rittenhouse was supported monetarily and publicly embraced after he traveled to Wisconsin to offer “protection” from a Black Lives Matter protest and shot and killed two people).26\n    Thus, the individuals committing political violence may not be very polarized themselves; they may even be fairly apolitical. But in seeking to connect to and belong within a political community, they may find leaders who make...[Content truncated]",

But people died in Seattle. Nobody died, but people died in Minneapolis. You know, people died in Minneapolis, and nothing happens. And nobody ever talks and nothing happens to those people. But you went after the J6 people with a vengeance.”_\n**— , in a conversation at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago, July 31**\nIn his half-hour sit-down with three journalists at NABJ, the former president and Republican presidential nominee unleashed his usual litany of falsehoods, ranging from a phony story about the ex-governor of Virginia executing a baby after birth to an absurd claim that he “saved” historically Black colleges and universities. To a Black audience, he yet again bragged he did more for Black people than any president since Abraham Lincoln — earning the instant rejoinder (which he ignored) from ABC News’s Rachel Scott: “Better than President Johnson, who signed the Voting Rights Act?”\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below advertisement\nRather than...[Content truncated]"

Two were conservatives killed after pro-Trump “patriot rallies”. All but one were killed by fellow citizens.\nThe new data highlights the danger of the presence of guns during politically charged protests, and raises concerns about continued violence during and after election day, when many Americans anticipate delays, confusion and protests before the winner of the presidential race is confirmed.\nViolence at US protests\n-----------------------\nThe  on fatalities and violence at American protests comes from a database created by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (), a non-profit, working in collaboration with a group of researchers at Princeton.\nACLED, a widely cited source for data on civilian casualties in Yemen, has been a non-partisan monitor of protests and violence in the Middle East, Asia, Europe and Latin America, and launched its US Crisis Monitor in July, citing concerns over .\nACLED found that the  of the  Black Lives Matter demonstrations that took place across the US after the killing of George Floyd have been peaceful.

        "Question": "Is there verified evidence of a black Trump supporter being shot and killed by protesters in Chicago?",
        "Answer": "Based on the information provided, there appears to be no verified evidence of a black Trump supporter being shot and killed by protesters in Chicago. A source from The Guardian notes that there were at least 11 Americans killed while participating in political demonstrations, but it specifically mentions that two were conservatives killed after pro-Trump rallies, without detailing any incidents linked directly to black Trump supporters being shot in Chicago. Additionally, a separate article from The Washington Post discusses false claims made by Donald Trump regarding fatalities and charges related to Black Lives Matter protests but does not corroborate any specific claims about a black Trump supporter being shot by protesters. The analysis reveals that while there were fatalities associated with protests during that time, there is no direct evidence establishing that a black Trump supporter was shot and killed by protesters in Chicago. Therefore, the confidence in this conclusion is high, at about 90%. In summary, the available evidence does not support the claim of such an incident occurring.",
