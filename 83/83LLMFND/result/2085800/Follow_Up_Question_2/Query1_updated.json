This essay describes the history of such forces in the U.S., shares the risk factors for election violence globally and how they are trending in the U.S., and concludes with some potential paths to mitigate the problem.\nOne week after the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Eric Coomer, an executive at Dominion Voting Systems, was forced into hiding. Angry supporters of then-president Donald Trump, believing false accusations that Dominion had switched votes in favor of Joe Biden, published Coomer\u2019s home address and phone number and put a million-dollar bounty on his head. Coomer was one of many people in the crosshairs. An unprecedented number of elections administrators received threats in 2020\u2014so much so that a third of poll workers surveyed by the Brennan Center for Justice in April 2021 said that they felt unsafe and 79 percent wanted government-provided security. In July, the Department of Justice set up a special task force specifically to combat threats against election administrators.\nFrom death threats against previously anonymous bureaucrats and public-health officials to a plot to kidnap Michigan\u2019s governor and the 6 January 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, acts of political violence in the United States have skyrocketed in the last five years.\u00a0The nature of political violence has also changed. The media\u2019s focus on groups such as the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and Boogaloo Bois has obscured a deeper trend: the \u201cungrouping\u201d of political violence as people self-radicalize via online engagement. According to the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), which maintains the Global Terrorism Database, most political violence in the United States is committed by people who do not belong to any formal organization.\nAbout the...[Content truncated]",

Americans across parties share many policy preferences. There is some overlap even on hot-button issues, such as abortion and guns, and more overlap on how to teach American history.1 It is important not to make too much of this overlap, however. For instance, a majority of Democrats as well as four in ten Republicans support banning high-capacity ammunition magazines and creating a federal database to track gun sales; nearly as many Republicans support banning assault-style weapons. But only 18 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaners feel gun violence is a major problem (versus 73 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaners). So despite the significant policy overlap, only one side is motivated to put the issue on the agenda.2 Democrats have moved to the left on racial issues and some social issues over the last decade, and Republicans have moved to the right on immigration under Joe Biden\u2019s administration, though there remains overlap on these issues as well.3 In some cases, Republicans appear to be slowly adopting more progressive views on some social issues, resulting in what looks like polarization but is perhaps better characterized as faster moves by the left.4\n    However, most partisans hold major misbeliefs about the other party\u2019s preferences that lead them to think there is far less shared policy belief. This perception gap is highest among progressive activists, followed closely by extreme conservatives: in other words, the people who are most involved in civic and political life hold the least accurate views of the other side\u2019s beliefs. Figure 1 shows the gap between what groups of Americans think the other side believes and what they self-report believing, as of 2019.\n    !\n2.  **American politicians are highly ideologically polarized. In other words, they believe in and vote for different sets of policies, with little overlap. This trend has grown in a steady, unpunctuated manner for decades.**5 One reason that the most highly politically engaged Americans may misunderstand the other side is that they correctly estimate the extreme ideological polarization among politicians.\n    It is easy to assume that polarized voters are selecting more polarized leaders\u2014and that theory may hold true for recent primary elections. However, that is not the main story...[Content truncated]",

Trends in Acceptance of Political Violence\nAccording to nearly every measure of both beliefs and actual incidents, political violence is considered more acceptable than it was five years ago before then-President Trump took office.\n#### Beliefs:\nThe most consistent survey data comes from scholars Lilliana Mason and Nathan Kalmoe, who have been tracking public opinion on political violence using identical questions and methods for the last five years.1 From 2017 when their tracking begins, support for political violence rises across several measures prior to the midterm elections and declines after the elections. It also spikes (especially for Republicans) around then-President Trump\u2019s first impeachment, and again drops afterward. Support for violence from 2017 through the summer of 2020 is generally quite close across parties but somewhat higher for Democrats, though as I\u2019ll show later, actual incidents of violence are far higher for Republicans.\n**The 2020 election season was an inflection point that led to a step-change in acceptance of violence as a political tool,** particularly among Republicans. During the month of the election, Republican support for violence leaps across each of Kalmoe and Mason\u2019s questions. Democratic justifications rise in response to some questions but fall in others, and their support moves after Republican opinion and grows less quickly.\nBy February 2021, 25% of Republicans and 17% of Democrats felt threats against the other party\u2019s leaders were justifiable, and 19% of Republicans and 10% of Democrats believed it was justified to harass ordinary members of the other party. One in five Republicans (20%) and 13% of Democrats claimed that political violence was justified \u201cthese days\u201d.\n**In each case, support for political violence has doubled for Republicans since 2017 and has grown for Democrats.**\n!\nTo put this level of support into context: In 1973 during the most violent period of Northern Ireland\u2019s Troubles, 25% of Catholics and 16% of Protestants agreed that \u201cviolence is a legitimate way to achieve one\u2019s goals.\u201d2 The U.S. is fast approaching these numbers.\nOther polls trace the same leap in acceptance of violence following the election, particularly among Republicans. For instance, similar questions were posed a year apart by scholar Larry Bartels and the AEI Survey Center on American Life. In January 2020, half of Republicans and...[Content truncated]",

She said they were there to protest Trump's \"fascist language,\" and that members of the crowd confronted them.\n\"Many of them were shoving us, pushing us, trying to rip the banner from us,\" she said.\n!\nQuestions have been raised in recent days after a man at a Trump rally  a protester leaving an event in North Carolina, and after a Breitbart reporter accused Trump\u2019s campaign manager  hard enough to cause a bruise. The campaign manager has denied the claim.\n**RELATED: **\nEarlier Friday at a rally in St. Louis, Trump was repeatedly interrupted by protesters. A total of 32 people were arrested at the event at the Peabody Opera House, police said.\nTrump\u2019s rivals criticized Trump\u2019s rhetoric and language as predictably leading to violence. Marco Rubio pointed to instances where Trump has said he  a protester and made similar comments.\n\"It shouldn\u2019t surprise us that you see a growing amount of violence at some of his events,\" Rubio said.\n!\nTed Cruz said responsibility for the violence lay with those trading blows, but added \"any candidate is responsible for the culture of the campaign.\"\nHillary Clinton on Saturday also spoke about the incidents in Chicago during a campaign stop in St. Louis.\n\"The ugly, divisive rhetoric we are hearing from Donald Trump and the encouragement of violence and aggression is wrong, and it\u2019s dangerous,\" Clinton said. \"If you play with matches, you\u2019re going to start a fire you can\u2019t control. That\u2019s not leadership. That\u2019s political arson.\"\n!\nAli Vitali\nAli Vitali is a Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News, based in Washington.\u00a0She is the author of \"Electable: Why America Hasn\u2019t Put a Woman in the White House ...
