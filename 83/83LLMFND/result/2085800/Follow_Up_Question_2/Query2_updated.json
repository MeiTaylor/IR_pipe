Yet since 1980, a shift in control of at least one house of Congress was possible\u2014and since 2010, elections have seen a level of competition not seen since Reconstruction (1865\u201377).\n**_Partisan division based on identity:_**\u00a0Up to the 1990s, many Americans belonged to multiple identity groups\u2014for example, a union member might have been a conservative, religious, Southern man who nevertheless voted Democratic. Today, Americans have sorted themselves into two broad identity groups: Democrats tend to live in cities, are more likely to be minorities, women, and religiously unaffiliated, and are trending liberal.\u00a0Republicans generally live in rural areas or exurbs and are more likely to be white, male, Christian, and conservative.\u00a0Those who hold a cross-cutting identity (such as black Christians or female Republicans) generally cleave to the other identities that align with their partisan \u201ctribe.\u201d\nAs political psychologist Lilliana Mason has shown, greater homogeneity within groups with fewer cross-cutting ties allows people to form clearer in- and out-groups, priming them for conflict. When many identities align, belittling any one of them can trigger humiliation and anger. Such feelings are heightened by policy differences but are not about policy; they are personal, and thus are more powerful. These real cultural and belief differences are at the heart of the cultural conflicts in the United States.\nU.S. party and electoral institutions are intensifying rather than reducing these identity cleavages. The alignment of racial and religious identity with political party is not random. Sorting began after the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1965 as whites who disagreed with racial equality fled the Democratic Party. A second wave\u2014the so-called Reagan Democrats, who had varied ideological motivations, followed in 1980 and 1984. A third wave, pushed away from the Democratic Party by the election of Barack Obama and attracted by Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, drew previous swing voters who were particularly likely to define \u201cAmericanness\u201d as white and Christian into the Republican Party.\nA 2016 Pew Research Center poll found that 32 percent of U.S. citizens believed that to be a \u201creal American,\u201d one must be a U.S.-born Christian. But among Trump\u2019s primary voters, according to a 2017 Voter Study Group analysis, 86 percent thought it was \u201cvery important\u201d to have been born in the United States; 77 percent believed that one must be Christian; and 47 percent thought one must also be \u201cof European descent.\u201d...[Content truncated]",

As the mayhem took hold, Trump was reduced to complaining about the situation on the air, telling MSNBC: \u201cIt\u2019s sad when you can\u2019t have a rally. Whatever happened to freedom of speech?\u201d\nThe rally had been due to take place at a university that is one of the most diverse in the country, at a venue situated in the heart of , a Democratic stronghold where there are few registered Republicans.\nBefore the rally was even due to start, the scene for the evening was set as protesters inside the pavilion vented their opposition to the presidential candidate\u2019s positions on immigration, race and other issues where his rhetoric has proven divisive.\n Guardian\nThe shouts on both sides were often crude and vulgar. Trump supporters yelled \u201cGo back to Univision\u201d at Hispanic people and hurled a racially charged insult at an African American woman; while those opposed to the candidate shouted \u201cFuck Donald Trump\u201d and taunted police officers.\n!\nProtesters celebrate after it is announced that the rally has been cancelled.

After Fox News made an early call during the November 2020 election that the majority of Arizonans had voted for Biden for president, 37 percent of the network\u2019s prime-time viewers chose to move their viewership temporarily to more extreme outlets, such as Newsmax and One America News, that reported for months that a Trump victory was possible (or had actually occurred). Viewers were shaping the content, rather than being led by it.122 Similarly, after Fox News fired its most popular host, the right-wing personality Tucker Carlson, viewership plummeted\u2014while viewership increased during the same period at Newsmax.123 More polarized people may also be more motivated to engage with polarizing social media. Studies of YouTube showed that most engagement with extremist content was largely confined to a small, concentrated group of people who had preexisting, negative views on gender and race.124 And while partisan traditional news sources do seem to exacerbate polarization in America, in Europe there is little evidence to suggest that exposure to partisan or populist traditional media causes widespread polarization.125\n    It could be that social media and partisan traditional media are having more polarizing effects in America than elsewhere because of other factors. For instance, having a trusted media source\u2014whether a national source of record or a strong local news source\u2014might mitigate the polarizing effects of social and partisan media. In the United States, no single news source is trusted by more than 50 percent of Americans, while in the United Kingdom, for example, 86 percent of Britons say that they are satisfied with their state broadcasting service.126 Countries that spend more on public broadcasting have seen greater decreases in polarization, though the direction of causality is unclear.127 In the United States, it is possible that local news played the mediating, trusted role that a government broadcaster plays in some other democracies and that the decline of local news is enhancing affective polarization. One study found that after communities lost a local newspaper, voters were less likely to split their ticket in federal elections.128 The decline of local news has also been linked to lower voter turnout and citizen engagement in general.129\n4.  **Inequality and economics.** While ideological polarization in Congress is correlated with inequality, inequality\u2019s relationship with affective polarization is much less clear\u2014in part because there are very few studies on it.\n    *   One multicountry study found that high inequality and unemployment were correlated with greater affective polarization; however, another study using the same data but a different evaluation method found that the role of inequality no longer held.130\n    *   Other studies looking across countries suggest that inequality is poorly correlated with affective polarization.

Second, terrorism in the United States will likely increase over the next year in response to several factors. One of the most concerning is the 2020 U.S. presidential election, before and after which extremists may resort to violence, depending on the outcome of the election. Far-right and far-left networks have used violence against each other at protests, raising the possibility of escalating violence during the election period.\nThe rest of this brief is divided into the following sections. The first defines terrorism and its main types. The second\u00a0section analyzes terrorism trends in the United States since 1994. The third examines far-right, far-left, and religious networks. The fourth section highlights the terrorism threat over the next year.\n#### **DEFINITIONS**\nThis analysis focuses on terrorism: the deliberate use\u2014or threat\u2014of violence by non-state actors in order to achieve political goals and create a broad psychological impact.4 Violence\u2014and the threat of violence\u2014are important components of terrorism. Overall, this analysis divides terrorism into four broad categories: right-wing, left-wing, religious, and ethnonationalist.5 To be clear, terms like right-wing and left-wing terrorism do not\u2014in any way\u2014correspond to mainstream political parties in the United States, such as the Republican and Democratic parties, which eschew terrorism. Instead, terrorism is orchestrated by a small minority of extremists.\nFirst, _right-wing terrorism_ refers to the use or threat of violence by sub-national or non-state entities whose goals may include racial or ethnic supremacy; opposition to government authority; anger at women, including from the incel (\u201cinvoluntary celibate\u201d) movement; and outrage against certain policies, such as abortion.6 This analysis uses the term \u201cright-wing terrorism\u201d rather than \u201cracially- and ethnically-motivated violent extremism,\u201d or REMVE, which is used by some in the U.S. government.7 Second, _left-wing_ _terrorism_ involves the use or threat of violence by sub-national or non-state entities that oppose capitalism, imperialism, and colonialism; pursue environmental or animal rights issues; espouse pro-communist or pro-socialist beliefs; or support a decentralized social and political system such as anarchism. Third, _religious terrorism_ includes violence in support of a faith-based belief system, such as Islam, Judaism, Christianity, and Hinduism, among many others. As highlighted in the next section, the primary threat from religious terrorists comes from Sal...[Content truncated]",

As Trump has inched closer to the Republican nomination in recent weeks, protesters have become increasingly drawn to his events; those demonstrations have, in many instances, resulted in physical altercations.\nTrump wasted no time addressing Friday\u2019s cancellation, saying that his supporters \u201ccaused no problem\u201d at his rally, instead saying supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders are to blame.\n\u201cMy people are nice,\u201d Trump said at a Saturday morning rally in Dayton. \u201cThousands and thousands of people, they caused no problem. They were taunted, they were harassed by these other people. These other people, by the way, some represent Bernie, our communist. \u2026 He should really get up and say to his people: Stop.

I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m telling you. And we want to get along with everybody, and we can get along with people. We\u2019re going to unify the country.
