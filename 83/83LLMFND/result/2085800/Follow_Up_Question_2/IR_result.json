After Fox News made an early call during the November 2020 election that the majority of Arizonans had voted for Biden for president, 37 percent of the network’s prime-time viewers chose to move their viewership temporarily to more extreme outlets, such as Newsmax and One America News, that reported for months that a Trump victory was possible (or had actually occurred). Viewers were shaping the content, rather than being led by it.122 Similarly, after Fox News fired its most popular host, the right-wing personality Tucker Carlson, viewership plummeted—while viewership increased during the same period at Newsmax.123 More polarized people may also be more motivated to engage with polarizing social media. Studies of YouTube showed that most engagement with extremist content was largely confined to a small, concentrated group of people who had preexisting, negative views on gender and race.124 And while partisan traditional news sources do seem to exacerbate polarization in America, in Europe there is little evidence to suggest that exposure to partisan or populist traditional media causes widespread polarization.125\n    It could be that social media and partisan traditional media are having more polarizing effects in America than elsewhere because of other factors. For instance, having a trusted media source—whether a national source of record or a strong local news source—might mitigate the polarizing effects of social and partisan media. In the United States, no single news source is trusted by more than 50 percent of Americans, while in the United Kingdom, for example, 86 percent of Britons say that they are satisfied with their state broadcasting service.126 Countries that spend more on public broadcasting have seen greater decreases in polarization, though the direction of causality is unclear.127 In the United States, it is possible that local news played the mediating, trusted role that a government broadcaster plays in some other democracies and that the decline of local news is enhancing affective polarization. One study found that after communities lost a local newspaper, voters were less likely to split their ticket in federal elections.128 The decline of local news has also been linked to lower voter turnout and citizen engagement in general.129\n4.  **Inequality and economics.** While ideological polarization in Congress is correlated with inequality, inequality’s relationship with affective polarization is much less clear—in part because there are very few studies on it.\n    *   One multicountry study found that high inequality and unemployment were correlated with greater affective polarization; however, another study using the same data but a different evaluation method found that the role of inequality no longer held.130\n    *   Other studies looking across countries suggest that inequality is poorly correlated with affective polarization.

        "Question": "What reliable sources report incidents of violence against Trump supporters in Chicago during protests?",
        "Answer": "Several reliable sources report incidents of violence against Trump supporters in Chicago during protests: 1. **The Guardian** reported that a rally for Donald Trump in Chicago was called off amid significant violence and chaos. The article details how scuffles broke out between Trump supporters, protesters, and police, resulting in several arrests. The presence of violent confrontations before and during the rally exemplifies the intense atmosphere and the escalation of conflicts between the two groups [Query1_evidence_1]. 2. Another article from **The Washington Post** highlights that protests against Donald Trump escalated into violent confrontations in both Chicago and St. Louis. It emphasized the sometimes-violent nature of the interactions between supporters and protesters, framing this as part of the larger trends observed at Trump's rallies [Query1_evidence_2]. Overall, these reliable sources provide substantial evidence of violence against Trump supporters in Chicago, particularly in the context of protests surrounding his rallies.",
