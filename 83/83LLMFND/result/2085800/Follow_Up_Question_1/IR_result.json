But Trump has never had to cancel a rally because of the threat of protesters.\nA crowd of more than 9,000 learned of the cancellation about 6:35 p.m. Central time, more than half an hour after Trump was scheduled to take the stage. The thousands of protesters immediately burst into cheers and began chanting: \"We stopped Trump! We stopped Trump!\" Many of Trump's supporters, who had waited hours to see him, seemed stunned and a few tried a chant of their own, without much luck: \"USA! USA!\" As the two sides reacted to the news, skirmishes broke out in the crowd and spilled out of the arena into a mass protest outside.\n\"It sent a message that Chicago is a very liberal city and it will always be a liberal city because it does not promote hate — it promotes love and it promotes prosperity,\" said Farris Ahmad, 23, a protester and junior political science major at the College of DuPage.

        "Question": "What evidence exists of violent protests in Chicago against Trump supporters, specifically regarding the Claim's details?",
        "Answer": "The evidence of violent protests in Chicago against Trump supporters is substantial and documented in various reports. 1. **Trump Rally Cancellation Due to Violence**: Donald Trump called off a rally in Chicago due to safety concerns, stating that there were violent clashes between his supporters and protesters. Hundreds of protesters gathered at the venue, leading to confrontations inside the auditorium, which escalated to fights between the two groups. This escalation resulted in the violence being significant enough to cause Trump to postpone the event after consulting with local police [Query 1_evidence_1]. 2. **Scuffles and Arrests**: Following the cancellation, scuffles broke out both inside the venue and in the streets outside between Trump supporters and protesters, leading to several arrests. Witnesses described a chaotic scene with confrontations breaking out before and after the rally was called off, illustrating the intense atmosphere surrounding Trump's events [Query 1_evidence_2]. 3. **Racial Tensions**: A report highlights that clashes also reflected racial tensions, with supporters of Trump engaging in confrontational and often racially charged rhetoric towards protesters. This served to escalate the tensions even further, culminating in physical altercations [Query 1_evidence_3]. Overall, the collected evidence strongly indicates that significant violence occurred in Chicago during protests against Trump supporters, notably during the rally on March 11, 2016.",
