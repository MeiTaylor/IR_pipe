Some scholars claim that Americans are so polarized they are on the brink of civil war. Other polls suggest that voters agree on plenty of policies and that polarization is an illusion. Some philanthropists call for pluralism and civility, while others lean into activism, believing polarization is a byproduct of change toward a more just world. So, is the United States polarized or not? If it is, what is causing the polarization and what are its consequences? Should polarization be solved or tolerated?\nThis paper is intended to answer these questions. It opens with five facts about polarization in the United States today and what those imply for possible interventions. A literature review follows, organized chronologically to explain the scholarly shift from thinking of polarization as an ideological, policy-based phenomenon to an issue of emotion, as well as the emerging understanding of polarization as both a social phenomenon and a political strategy. This paper is organized as follows.\n**Part I: Introduction**\n*   Five Facts About Polarization in the United States\n*   What This Understanding Means for Interventions\n**Part II: The Literature on Polarization**\n*   First Generation Understanding: Elite Ideological Polarization\n    *  ...[Content truncated]",

While it is widely acknowledged that racist officers subsist within police departments around the country, federal, state, and local governments are doing far too little to proactively identify them, report their behavior to prosecutors who might unwittingly rely on their testimony in criminal cases, or protect the diverse communities they are sworn to serve.\nEfforts to address systemic and implicit biases in law enforcement are unlikely to be effective in reducing the racial disparities in the criminal justice system as long as explicit racism in law enforcement continues to endure. There is ample evidence to demonstrate that it does.\nIn 2017, the FBI reported that white supremacists posed a \u201cpersistent threat of lethal violence\u201d that has produced more fatalities than any other category of domestic terrorists since 2000. Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Homeland Security, Joint Intelligence Bulletin, _White Supremacist Extremism Poses Persistent Threat of Lethal Violence_, May 10, 2017,  Alarmingly, internal FBI policy documents have also warned agents assigned to domestic terrorism cases that the white supremacist and anti-government militia groups they investigate often have \u201cactive links\u201d to law enforcement officials. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Counterterrorism Division, _Counterterrorism Policy Directive and Policy Guide_, April 1, 2015 (updated November 18, 2015), 89, .\nThe harms that armed law enforcement officers affiliated with violent white supremacist and anti-government militia groups can inflict on American society could hardly be overstated. Yet despite the FBI\u2019s acknowledgement of the links between law enforcement and these suspected terrorist groups, the Justice Department has no national strategy designed to identify white supremacist police officers or to protect the safety and civil rights of the communities they patrol.\nObviously, only a tiny percentage of law enforcement officials are likely to be active members of white supremacist groups. But one doesn\u2019t need access to secretive intelligence gathered in FBI terrorism investigations to find evidence of overt and explicit racism within law enforcement. Since 2000, law enforcement officials with alleged connections to white supremacist groups or far-right militant activities have been exposed in Alabama, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and elsewhere.

A woman was shot and killed inside the Capitol, and Washington\u2019s mayor instituted an evening curfew in an attempt to contain the violence.\nThe rioters were egged on by Trump, who has spent weeks falsely attacking the integrity of the election and had urged his supporters to descend on Washington to protest Congress\u2019 formal approval of Biden\u2019s victory. Some Republican lawmakers were in the midst of raising objections to the results on his behalf when the proceedings were abruptly halted by the mob.\nTogether, the protests and the GOP election objections amounted to an almost unthinkable challenge to American democracy and exposed the depths of the divisions that have coursed through the country during Trump\u2019s four years in office.

It is being investigated by the FBI overseen by the Justice Department's National Security Division as well as the U.S. attorney's office in Pittsburgh and comes amid a heightened threat environment.\nThe Secret Service, in a statement, said that a shooter \"fired multiple shots toward the stage from an elevated position outside of the rally venue\" after which agents \"neutralized the shooter, who is now deceased.\"\nThe shooter fired as many as eight rounds from an AR-style rifle while perched on a rooftop adjacent to the venue and was 200-300 yards away at the time of the shooting, law enforcement sources told ABC News.\nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump is surrounded by U.S. Secret Service agents at a campaign rally, Saturday, July 13, 2024, in Butler, Pa.\nAP Photo/Evan Vucci\nAccording to a law enforcement source, the early indication is that the shooter was a lone wolf, but the situation is fluid.\nFBI Pittsburgh Special Agent in Charge Kevin Rojek said the agency was trying to assess the motive for the shooting. \"It's a matter of doing biometric confirmations, so there was no identification on the individual for example so we're looking at photographs right now and we're trying to run his DNA and get biometric confirmation.\"\nThere appeared to be blood on Trump's right ear as he was being taken off stage, and he could be seen mouthing \"fight\" and pumping his fist.\n**PHOTOS: Shots fired at Trump rally in Pennsylvania**\nPresident Joe Biden delivered remarks after former President Donald Trump was swarmed by Secret Service agents and rushed...[Content truncated]",

The decision immediately sparked nasty verbal and physical fights between protesters and Trump supporters who had been eager to see him that night.\nThe Republican front-runner\u2019s rallies have become increasingly violent in the past two weeks, and Trump\u2019s remarks are often interrupted by protesters denouncing his controversial stances, especially those on immigration and the treatment of Muslims. But Trump has never had to cancel a rally because of the threat of protesters.\nA crowd of more than 9,000 learned\u00a0of the cancellation about 6:35 p.m. Central time, more than half an hour after Trump was scheduled to take the stage. The thousands of protesters immediately burst into cheers and began chanting: \"We stopped Trump! We stopped Trump!\" Many of Trump's supporters, who had waited hours to see him, seemed stunned and a few tried a chant of their own, without much luck: \"USA! USA!\" As the two sides reacted to the news, skirmishes broke out in the crowd and spilled out of the arena into a mass protest outside.\n\"It sent a message that Chicago is a very liberal city and it will always be a liberal city because it does not promote hate \u2014\u00a0it promotes love and it promotes prosperity,\" said\u00a0Farris Ahmad, 23, a protester and junior political science major at the College of DuPage.

A total of 32 people were arrested at the event at the Peabody Opera House, police said.\nTrump\u2019s rivals criticized Trump\u2019s rhetoric and language as predictably leading to violence. Marco Rubio pointed to instances where Trump has said he  a protester and made similar comments.\n\"It shouldn\u2019t surprise us that you see a growing amount of violence at some of his events,\" Rubio said.\n!\nTed Cruz said responsibility for the violence lay with those trading blows, but added \"any candidate is responsible for the culture of the campaign.\"\nHillary Clinton on Saturday also spoke about the incidents in Chicago during a campaign stop in St. Louis.\n\"The ugly, divisive rhetoric we are hearing from Donald Trump and the encouragement of violence and aggression is wrong, and it\u2019s dangerous,\" Clinton said. \"If you play with matches, you\u2019re going to start a fire you can\u2019t control.

Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP\nTrump rally shooting comes amid rise in support for political violence\n======================================================================\nResearch shows more Americans support violence to stop a second Trump presidency than back violence in his favor\nSat 13 Jul 2024 21.24 EDTLast modified on Mon 15 Jul 2024 09.39 EDT\nA shooting at a Donald Trump rally in Butler, , on Saturday comes at a time of heightened support for political violence in the US, including against Trump.\nIt is still unclear why the shooter fired the gunshots at Trump\u2019s rally or what political beliefs he holds.
