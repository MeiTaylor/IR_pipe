This essay describes the history of such forces in the U.S., shares the risk factors for election violence globally and how they are trending in the U.S., and concludes with some potential paths to mitigate the problem.\nOne week after the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Eric Coomer, an executive at Dominion Voting Systems, was forced into hiding. Angry supporters of then-president Donald Trump, believing false accusations that Dominion had switched votes in favor of Joe Biden, published Coomer\u2019s home address and phone number and put a million-dollar bounty on his head. Coomer was one of many people in the crosshairs. An unprecedented number of elections administrators received threats in 2020\u2014so much so that a third of poll workers surveyed by the Brennan Center for Justice in April 2021 said that they felt unsafe and 79 percent wanted government-provided security. In July, the Department of Justice set up a special task force specifically to combat threats against election administrators.\nFrom death threats against previously anonymous bureaucrats and public-health officials to a plot to kidnap Michigan\u2019s governor and the 6 January 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, acts of political violence in the United States have skyrocketed in the last five years.\u00a0The nature of political violence has also changed. The media\u2019s focus on groups such as the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and Boogaloo Bois has obscured a deeper trend: the \u201cungrouping\u201d of political violence as people self-radicalize via online engagement. According to the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), which maintains the Global Terrorism Database, most political violence in the United States is committed by people who do not belong to any formal organization.\nAbout the...[Content truncated]",

Americans across parties share many policy preferences. There is some overlap even on hot-button issues, such as abortion and guns, and more overlap on how to teach American history.1 It is important not to make too much of this overlap, however. For instance, a majority of Democrats as well as four in ten Republicans support banning high-capacity ammunition magazines and creating a federal database to track gun sales; nearly as many Republicans support banning assault-style weapons. But only 18 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaners feel gun violence is a major problem (versus 73 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaners). So despite the significant policy overlap, only one side is motivated to put the issue on the agenda.2 Democrats have moved to the left on racial issues and some social issues over the last decade, and Republicans have moved to the right on immigration under Joe Biden\u2019s administration, though there remains overlap on these issues as well.3 In some cases, Republicans appear to be slowly adopting more progressive views on some social issues, resulting in what looks like polarization but is perhaps better characterized as faster moves by the left.4\n    However, most partisans hold major misbeliefs about the other party\u2019s preferences that lead them to think there is far less shared policy belief. This perception gap is highest among progressive activists, followed closely by extreme conservatives: in other words, the people who are most involved in civic and political life hold the least accurate views of the other side\u2019s beliefs. Figure 1 shows the gap between what groups of Americans think the other side believes and what they self-report believing, as of 2019.\n    !\n2.  **American politicians are highly ideologically polarized. In other words, they believe in and vote for different sets of policies, with little overlap. This trend has grown in a steady, unpunctuated manner for decades.**5 One reason that the most highly politically engaged Americans may misunderstand the other side is that they correctly estimate the extreme ideological polarization among politicians.\n    It is easy to assume that polarized voters are selecting more polarized leaders\u2014and that theory may hold true for recent primary elections. However, that is not the main story...[Content truncated]",

Hundreds of protesters, who had promised to be a visible presence here and filled several sections of the arena, let out an elated, unstopping cheer. Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, many of whom had waited hours to see the Republican front-runner, seemed stunned and slowly filed out in anger.\nAround the country, protesters have interrupted virtually every Trump rally, but his planned appearance here \u2014 in a city run for decades by Democrats and populated by nearly equal thirds of blacks, Latinos and whites \u2014 had drawn some particularly incensed responses since it was announced days ago.\nThe canceled rally came...[Content truncated]",

A white Trump supporter  a black protester at a rally earlier this month. Not long afterward, a Trump supporter at a different rally  a white protester, knocking him to the ground.\nThen, of course, in , protesters clashed with Trump\u2019s supporters and the police, forcing Trump to cancel a rally entirely.\nBut what do Americans make of all of this?\nIn an abstract sense, a vast majority of Americans support an individual\u2019s right to protest a political rally. More than three-quarters of respondents (77 percent) in the latest Vox/ poll said they believe crowds should leave protesters alone, rather than acting themselves to eject the protesters from rallies.\nBut the poll of 2,001 registered voters, conducted between March 17 and March 21, found much more partisan reactions to protest situations involving either violent protesters or Donald Trump. (Take a look at the poll\u2019s  and .)\nLiberals and Democrats were the most likely to agree with the statement, \u201cThe crowd should ignore the protesters until they are escorted out by police.\u201d But Republican and independent voters \u2014 even Tea Party supporters \u2014 showed overwhelming support for the right to protest.\nWe then asked the 77 percent of respondents who would prefer to leave a protester alone a follow-up question: What if the protester becomes violent? Of those, 42 percent think it\u2019s okay for the crowd to respond \u201cwith force\u201d to a violent protester. The threat of violence is where partisan fissures begin to show: Only 31 percent of Democrats think it\u2019s acceptable to meet violence with violence. But 51 percent of Republicans (and 47 percent of independents) believe force should be warranted if a protester begins to act violently.\nThat adds a bit of clarity to the partisan squabbling that\u2019s colored discussion of the recent incidents at Trump\u2019s rallies: Liberals can\u2019t understand why conservatives are reacting so harshly to protesters, and conservatives can\u2019t understand why liberals think it\u2019s abhorrent for them to react to protesters acting violently at...[Content truncated]",

A woman was shot and killed inside the Capitol, and Washington\u2019s mayor instituted an evening curfew in an attempt to contain the violence.\nThe rioters were egged on by Trump, who has spent weeks falsely attacking the integrity of the election and had urged his supporters to descend on Washington to protest Congress\u2019 formal approval of Biden\u2019s victory. Some Republican lawmakers were in the midst of raising objections to the results on his behalf when the proceedings were abruptly halted by the mob.\nTogether, the protests and the GOP election objections amounted to an almost unthinkable challenge to American democracy and exposed the depths of the divisions that have coursed through the country during Trump\u2019s four years in office. Though the efforts to block Biden from being sworn in on Jan. 20 were sure to fail, the support Trump has received for his efforts to overturn the election results have badly strained the nation\u2019s democratic guardrails.\nCongress reconvened in the evening, senators decrying the protests that defaced the Capitol and vowing to finish confirming the...[Content truncated]",
