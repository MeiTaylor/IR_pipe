Dustin Sternbeck, the chief D.C. police spokesman told the Post that detectives were reviewing surveillance video of the incident but it wasn\u2019t immediately clear what it showed.\nA  in the conservative website the Daily Caller based primarily on Marquez\u2019s account of the assault led to several reports that concluded that the men involved in the assault were affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement.\nBut D.C. police told the Post and the  they could not verify the identities of the men or the motive described by Marquez. One officer told Snopes that there was no indication that any of the individuals in the altercation were involved with or mentioned Black Lives Matter.\nSnopes also noted that Marquez had told the Daily Caller his memory of the incident was fuzzy after sustaining a blow to the back of the head and that he said some details of the incident were provided to him the next day by a manager of the McDonald\u2019s...[Content truncated]",

Bradley Kasal out of Fallujah\u2019s infamous \u201cHell House.\u201d\nMarquez, who served in the Marine Corps from 2003 to 2011, told police he was assaulted on Friday around 10:30 p.m.\u00a0while eating at a McDonald's, according to a Metropolitan Police Department report.\nMarquez said he believes the attack was racially motivated. He remembers being accosted at the McDonald's in Washington's Chinatown neighborhood by five people between 16 and 21 years old. Most were men or boys. One may have been female.\n\u201cThe kids were asking me if I think that black lives mattered,\u201d Marquez said on Monday. \u201cI was ignoring them, just because I felt intimidated. I felt how they approached me, it was very hostile. I felt they were really trying to intimidate me and just trying to start a confrontation with me.\u201d\nThe police report does not include a description of the people involved with the incident, which was first reported by\u00a0. One of the suspects allegedly hit Marquez with a gun after calling him a racist, the report says. Police have not yet made any arrests in the case, a spokesman said.\nThe suspects took Marquez\u2019 wallet, identification, credit cards, debit card and about $400 in cash, the report says.\nMarquez said his memories of what happened next are a blur. He said the restaurant\u2019s manager later told him that security camera footage shows one of the people hitting him in the back of the head with an unknown object as he was leaving the McDonald's...[Content truncated]",

Tritten\nTravis J. Tritten\nStars and Stripes \u2022 February 23, 2016\n* * *\n! \nSgt. Chris Marquez, left, and Cpl. Dane Shaffer, two of the three Marines the \"Hell House\" statue is based on, help unveil the new monument at the Warrior Hope and Care Center at Camp Lejeune, March 8, 2013. (U.S. Marines)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Police made two arrests Monday following the assault earlier this month of a decorated Marine outside a fast-food restaurant in Washington, D.C.\nA 17-year-old male was charged with aggravated assault and a 17-year-old female was charged with robbery. Both are from Washington and were not named by police due to their age.\nA third person was suspected in the Feb. 12 attack, which victim Christopher Marquez said was racially motivated. Police said the investigation is continuing.\n\u201cThe kids were asking me if I think that black lives mattered,\u201d Marquez told USA Today this month. \u201cI was ignoring them, just because I felt intimidated. I felt how they approached me, it was very hostile. I felt they were really trying to intimidate me and just trying to start a confrontation with me.\u201d\nA surveillance video released by police last week shows a black male assailant in a white tank top punch Marquez in the head from behind as Marquez walked out of a McDonald\u2019s on E Street across from FBI headquarters, according to police.\nMarquez, 30, is a Bronze Star with \u201cV\u201d device recipient who fought in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2004 and served until 2011.\nAfter being punched, Marquez fell to the ground where he was robbed by the female suspect and then kicked in the head, police said.\nMarquez was one of three Marines in an iconic photo taken during the second battle of Fallujah. He was photographed carrying a fellow Marine whose uniform is blood-soaked from a wound during the so-called Hell House battle during which one Marine was killed and 10 were wounded.\n _Twitter: _\nstripes Administrator\nstripes Administrator\n### Subscribe to Stars and Stripes\nJust 99c a week! \n* * *\nstars and stripes videos\n------------------------\n* * *\naround the web\n--------------\n* * *\nstripes top news\n----------------\n]\n### \n]\n...[Content truncated]",
