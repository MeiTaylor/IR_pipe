One can only hope that he continues telling tales for many years to come.\n!\nGeorge Orwell’s _Animal Farm_ is famous for the quote “Some animals are more equal than others.” Someone should write an update called _American Farm_ that includes the line _“Some hate crimes are more equal than others”_ after the Washington, D.C., attack of war hero Christopher Marquez.\nMost media outlets have not covered the Feb. 12 attack of Marquez, who served eight years on active duty between 2003 and 2011. In short, the Bronze Star recipient sat down to eat in a McDonald’s in the nation’s capital and was accosted by a group of teens demanding to know if he thought “black lives matter.”\nLike most sane people, he tried to ignore them and just eat his burger. _He was promptly ambushed and robbed upon exiting the restaurant._\n“I believe this was a hate crime and I was targeted because of my skin color,” Marquez told the  Feb. 15. “Too many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the mainstream media refuses to report on it.”\n!\nSuspects arrested in connection with Christopher Marquez’s assault and robbery will not be charged with a hate crime, despite harassing him with racial questions prior to their attack. (Photo: D.C. Metropolitan Police Department)\nThere are two very interesting facts about Marquez’s case:\n1.  Cops finally arrested and charge two individuals in connection with the incident, but _they  — even though they were explicitly harassing him about race and calling him “racist” before the attack._\n2.  President Obama, who always seems eager to weigh in on race-related crimes, _somehow can’t find his voice when it comes to Black Lives Matter supporters who beat a Marine veteran unconscious and stole $400, a VA medical card, and three credit cards from his back pocket just miles from the White House._ What did his assailants spend the stolen cash on, you ask? Answer: liquor, a Five Guys burgers, and products from Walmart.\nRegular readers of this blog may remember the case of , who was attacked by a similar group of kids on the DC Metro Green Line in 2011. They may also remember  on the Green Line from September 17, 2011.\nI wrote then:\n> As I came home late from work on the D.C. Metro Green line, an inebriated older man...[Content truncated]",

One can only hope that he continues telling tales for many years to come.\n!\nGeorge Orwell’s _Animal Farm_ is famous for the quote “Some animals are more equal than others.” Someone should write an update called _American Farm_ that includes the line _“Some hate crimes are more equal than others”_ after the Washington, D.C., attack of war hero Christopher Marquez.\nMost media outlets have not covered the Feb. 12 attack of Marquez, who served eight years on active duty between 2003 and 2011. In short, the Bronze Star recipient sat down to eat in a McDonald’s in the nation’s capital and was accosted by a group of teens demanding to know if he thought “black lives matter.”\nLike most sane people, he tried to ignore them and just eat his burger. _He was promptly ambushed and robbed upon exiting the restaurant._\n“I believe this was a hate crime and I was targeted because of my skin color,” Marquez told the  Feb. 15. “Too many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the mainstream media refuses to report on it.”\n!\nSuspects arrested in connection with Christopher Marquez’s assault and robbery will not be charged with a hate crime, despite harassing him with racial questions prior to their attack. (Photo: D.C. Metropolitan Police Department)\nThere are two very interesting facts about Marquez’s case:\n1.  Cops finally arrested and charge two individuals in connection with the incident, but _they  — even though they were explicitly harassing him about race and calling him “racist” before the attack._\n2.  President Obama, who always seems eager to weigh in on race-related crimes, _somehow can’t find his voice when it comes to Black Lives Matter supporters who beat a Marine veteran unconscious and stole $400, a VA medical card, and three credit cards from his back pocket just miles from the White House._ What did his assailants spend the stolen cash on, you ask? Answer: liquor, a Five Guys burgers, and products from Walmart.\nRegular readers of this blog may remember the case of , who was attacked by a similar group of kids on the DC Metro Green Line in 2011. They may also remember  on the Green Line from September 17, 2011.\nI wrote then:\n> As I came home late from work on the D.C. Metro Green line, an inebriated older man...[Content truncated]",

Accordingly, appellant's claim fails. \n## II. FELONS WERE PROPERLY EXCLUDED FROM SERVING ON APPELLANT'S JURY \nAppellant claims the statutory exclusion of felons from jury service denied him his rights to a jury selected from a representative cross-section of the community, equal protection, due process, and a fair trial. (AOB 36-44.) Appellant's claim is forfeited by his failure to raise it in the trial court. Further, appellant fails to support his equal protection and due process claims with any \nargument or supporting authority. In any event, the claim fails because the cited constitutional provisions do not require that felons be permitted to serve on Junes. 42 Outside the presence of the other prospective jurors, a prospective juror informed the court that he had previously been convicted of burglary and robbery. He had served a prison term and a term of parole, which ended in 1991. (8RT 668-671.) Outside the prospective juror's presence, the prosecutor and court indicated that they did not think felons were permitted to serve on a jury. (8RT 671-672.) Defense counsel stated that he would like to confirm the prosecutor and court's conclusion. (8RT 672.) The court, prosecutor, and defense counsel consulted the rules on juror qualifications. Referring to Code of Civil Procedure section 203, subdivision (a)(5), the court stated that felons were not permitted to serve on juries. (8RT 672.) The prosecutor and defense counsel agreed with the court's reading of the statute, and both parties stipulated to excusing the felon. (8RT 672-673.) Appellant forfeited his claim of error by stipulating to the felon's exclusion, and not objecting to the panel or moving to quash the venire.  \n> (People\nv. DeSantis, supra, 2 Ca1.4th at pp. 1216-1217 ; see People v. Fauber, supra, 2 Ca1.4th at p. 816 ; People v. Howard, supra, 1 Ca1.4th at p. 1159 .) In any event, appellant's claim that the exclusion of felons denied him a representative jury fails because felons are not a distinctive group within the meaning of the three-prong Duren test. As explained, to establish that a defendant's right to an impartial jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community has been violated, \"the defendant must show (1) that the ...[Content truncated]",
