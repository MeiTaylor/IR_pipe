Dustin Sternbeck, the chief D.C. police spokesman told the Post that detectives were reviewing surveillance video of the incident but it wasn\u2019t immediately clear what it showed.\nA  in the conservative website the Daily Caller based primarily on Marquez\u2019s account of the assault led to several reports that concluded that the men involved in the assault were affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement.\nBut D.C. police told the Post and the  they could not verify the identities of the men or the motive described by Marquez. One officer told Snopes that there was no indication that any of the individuals in the altercation were involved with or mentioned Black Lives Matter.\nSnopes also noted that Marquez had told the Daily Caller his memory of the incident was fuzzy after sustaining a blow to the back of the head and that he said some details of the incident were provided to him the next day by a manager of the McDonald\u2019s...[Content truncated]",

It notes the racial nature of the confrontation and includes Marquez's claims about the attack being unprovoked and racially motivated. This evidence provides context for the claim that his attackers were motivated by the Black Lives Matter activist movement, making it highly relevant to assessing the truth of the claim."

But when those children went to practice the same customs that they were used to doing in their communities, they were murdered \\. I felt a lot of pain and a lot of powerlessness. I have two children, and I worried that they would meet the same fate.\nAmid all that impotence I thought, too, about King\u2019s speech, and I said, \u201cI have a dream that one day our children won\u2019t be murdered for picking sugarcane.\u201d And that\u2019s when I made the decision to run for president. I didn\u2019t give it too much thought. I have to admit, I rejected politics because of everything that I had lived through, because my community has always had to defend itself from the state. Even though they say that we\u2019re all one nation, Black people, Indigenous people and farmworkers have been the most excluded and marginalized. I didn\u2019t want anything to do with the state or politics because the politics I knew didn\u2019t make me feel proud of my people, of my country. It\u2019s a politics based on corruption, based on violence, based on dispossession.\nTaking a risk that I might get trapped in all of that, I decided to participate in the system and change it. I made the decision, then, to run for the presidency. After many political attacks and rampant racism, I ended up as Gustavo Petro\u2019s running mate and we were both elected.\nPolitics isn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s not like I have changed much, but we\u2019re planting a seed to grow a politics that\u2019s different from what I have known, from what my parents knew, from what my grandparents knew.\n**Rodr\u00edguez:** Now as a vice president, do you continue facing those racist attacks? Just two days ago, your security team foiled an assassination attempt. How are you processing that, and do you feel like that has to do with your race and gender?\n**M\u00e1rquez:** It\u2019s tough. I\u2019ve been through a lot of violence. I\u2019ve been compared to monkeys, to animals, and I\u2019ve been disparaged as...[Content truncated]",

One can only hope that he continues telling tales for many years to come.\n!\nGeorge Orwell\u2019s _Animal Farm_ is famous for the quote \u201cSome animals are more equal than others.\u201d Someone should write an update called _American Farm_ that includes the line _\u201cSome hate crimes are more equal than others\u201d_ after the Washington, D.C., attack of war hero Christopher Marquez.\nMost media outlets have not covered the Feb. 12 attack of Marquez, who served eight years on active duty between 2003 and 2011. In short, the Bronze Star recipient sat down to eat in a McDonald\u2019s in the nation\u2019s capital and was accosted by a group of teens demanding to know if he thought \u201cblack lives matter.\u201d\nLike most sane people, he tried to ignore them and just eat his burger. _He was promptly ambushed and robbed upon exiting the restaurant._\n\u201cI believe this was a hate crime and I was targeted because of my skin color,\u201d Marquez told the  Feb. 15. \u201cToo many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the mainstream media refuses to report on it.\u201d\n!\nSuspects arrested in connection with Christopher Marquez\u2019s assault and robbery will not be charged with a hate crime, despite harassing him with racial questions prior to their attack. (Photo: D.C. Metropolitan Police Department)\nThere are two very interesting facts about Marquez\u2019s case:\n1.  Cops finally arrested and charge two individuals in connection with the incident, but _they  \u2014 even though they were explicitly harassing him about race and calling him \u201cracist\u201d before the attack._\n2.  President Obama, who always seems eager to weigh in on race-related crimes, _somehow can\u2019t find his voice when it comes to Black Lives Matter supporters who beat a Marine veteran unconscious and stole $400, a VA medical card, and three credit cards from his back pocket just miles from the White House._ What did his assailants spend the stolen cash on, you ask? Answer: liquor, a Five Guys burgers, and products from Walmart.\nRegular readers of this blog may remember the case of , who was attacked by a similar group of kids on the DC Metro Green Line in 2011.

In fact, the police killing of Valenzuela drew little attention outside the American Southwestern city just north of the U.S.-Mexico border.\nThe details about Floyd\u2019s death, a 46-year-old Black man, who died in May at the hands of Minneapolis police closely resembles that of Valenzuela, a Mexican American man, who was killed in Las Cruces, New Mexico, three months before global protests and outrage. Like Floyd, Valenzuela died from a choking maneuver during an encounter with an officer after a struggle.\nAs national Black Lives Matter demonstrations grow, Latino activists are joining the multiracial protests while trying to draw attention to their deadly police encounters, some of which go back decades. Latino advocates and families of those killed by police say they aren\u2019t trying to pull the focus away from Black lives, but want to illustrate their own suffering from policing and systemic racism.\nActivists say cases from  to  point to patterns of violent interactions by police against Latinos similar to those of Black people. As with the killings of Black men and women, officers rarely face punishment in the death of Latinos. However, Latino cases seldom garner national attention, even when caught on video.\nThe lack of attention around Latinos and police highlights how little is known about Latino history in the U.S. and the racism endured in the American Southwest and the U.S.-Mexico border. It also marks the backlash some Mexican Americans face when trying to join the national conversation about race.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like they don\u2019t care about Latinos and the racism we face,\u201d said Frank Alvarado, Sr., 76, a retired U.S. Marine whose son was shot multiple times by Salinas, California, police in 2014 Alvarado has since joined Black Lives Matter protests in nearby Sacramento.\nAccording to the , between 2015 and April 2020, Black Americans are killed at the...[Content truncated]",

One can only hope that he continues telling tales for many years to come.\n!\nGeorge Orwell\u2019s _Animal Farm_ is famous for the quote \u201cSome animals are more equal than others.\u201d Someone should write an update called _American Farm_ that includes the line _\u201cSome hate crimes are more equal than others\u201d_ after the Washington, D.C., attack of war hero Christopher Marquez.\nMost media outlets have not covered the Feb. 12 attack of Marquez, who served eight years on active duty between 2003 and 2011. In short, the Bronze Star recipient sat down to eat in a McDonald\u2019s in the nation\u2019s capital and was accosted by a group of teens demanding to know if he thought \u201cblack lives matter.\u201d\nLike most sane people, he tried to ignore them and just eat his burger. _He was promptly ambushed and robbed upon exiting the restaurant._\n\u201cI believe this was a hate crime and I was targeted because of my skin color,\u201d Marquez told the  Feb. 15. \u201cToo many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the mainstream media refuses to report on it.\u201d\n!\nSuspects arrested in connection with Christopher Marquez\u2019s assault and robbery will not be charged with a hate crime, despite harassing him with racial questions prior to their attack. (Photo: D.C. Metropolitan Police Department)\nThere are two very interesting facts about Marquez\u2019s case:\n1.  Cops finally arrested and charge two individuals in connection with the incident, but _they  \u2014 even though they were explicitly harassing him about race and calling him \u201cracist\u201d before the attack._\n2.  President Obama, who always seems eager to weigh in on race-related crimes, _somehow can\u2019t find his voice when it comes to Black Lives Matter supporters who beat a Marine veteran unconscious and stole $400, a VA medical card, and three credit cards from his back pocket just miles from the White House._ What did his assailants spend the stolen cash on, you ask? Answer: liquor, a Five Guys burgers, and products from Walmart.\nRegular readers of this blog may remember the case of , who was attacked by a similar group of kids on the DC Metro Green Line in 2011. They may also remember  on the Green Line from September 17, 2011.\nI wrote then:\n> As I came home late from work on the D.C. Metro Green line, an inebriated older man...[Content truncated]",

It was late January 2013, barely a month after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, and these were the families of some of the victims. Eleven of them had somehow summoned the strength to come to Washington to meet privately with Vice President Biden, members of Congress and cabinet members. But they weren\u2019t here simply to accept high-level condolences. They had come to listen and to learn about mental health and school safety policy. And they were preparing to wade into some of the roughest waters in American politics: the gun debate.\nI was there to help them navigate those waters.

President Obama had given a resolute speech in Connecticut vowing to fight for change, and members of Congress seemed to be reacting more like parents than politicians. Senator Joe Manchin, a gun-owning Democrat from West Virginia, said on television what many Americans were saying at their kitchen tables: \u201cThey are killing our babies; this has got to stop.\u201d\nAs Joe Manchin knew, however, it was never going to be that simple. Time and again, high-profile gun crimes\u2014from assassinations to mass shootings\u2014had seemed to galvanize public opinion. Yet time and again, this sense of urgency had faded, as the gun lobby slowed momentum in Congress to a crawl and then, often, to a halt.\nI stood before the Sandy Hook families on that day...[Content truncated]",
