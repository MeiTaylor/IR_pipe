I began looking into cases just like Nicole several years ago, where an alleged victim of sexual assault becomes the suspect and is charged with crimes like false reporting. I looked closely at 52 cases, and I saw patterns emerge, like 15 cases were decided in a day. Once police find inaccuracies or contradictions, they turn their investigation around, and other times they never even interview the alleged suspect. Police records sometimes show very little evidence to back up the false reporting charges. After Nicole tells her whole experience to Colangelo, she has to decide whether she wants to officially change her statement or not.\nDetective Colan\u2026:\tDo you want to consult with your attorney?\nNicole Chase:\tCan I do that?\nDetective Colan\u2026:\tSure.\nNicole Chase:\tI just want to make sure that I might even still have a chance at least of getting some type of justice.\nRachel de Leon:\tThree weeks after her interview with Colangelo, Nicole goes back to the station. She\u2019s there to officially revise her statement and turn in printouts of texts which Colangelo asked her for. A dispatcher tells her Colangelo\u2019s busy and he\u2019ll reach out if he needs her. She never hears back from him and emails the detective twice to follow up. By this time, Colangelo has already submitted a warrant for her arrest and when he finally emails her back, he doesn\u2019t tell her that. It\u2019s been two and a half months since Nicole has told Detective Colangelo the full story. She gets a call from him, and she can\u2019t believe what she\u2019s hearing.\nNicole Chase:\tYou have a warrant out for arrest, you need to come into the station. And I just held that phone and in my head, I have no idea what a warrant for my arrest is for because I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\nRachel de Leon:\tThe charge, making a false statement to a police officer. She turns herself in later that day.\nSpeaker 1:\tNicole started out as a victim reporting an alleged crime to the police. Then a detective lied to her and now she\u2019s being charged for lying to him. When we come back, Nicole fights back. That\u2019s next on Reveal.\n\tFrom the Center for Investigative Reporting in PRX, this is Reveal. I\u2019m Al Letson. We\u2019ve been talking about the police investigation into a report of sexual assault, but this isn\u2019t your typical case. What makes it stand out is who the police arrested, not the alleged perpetrator...[Content truncated]",
