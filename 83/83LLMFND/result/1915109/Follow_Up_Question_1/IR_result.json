I began looking into cases just like Nicole several years ago, where an alleged victim of sexual assault becomes the suspect and is charged with crimes like false reporting. I looked closely at 52 cases, and I saw patterns emerge, like 15 cases were decided in a day. Once police find inaccuracies or contradictions, they turn their investigation around, and other times they never even interview the alleged suspect. Police records sometimes show very little evidence to back up the false reporting charges. After Nicole tells her whole experience to Colangelo, she has to decide whether she wants to officially change her statement or not.\nDetective Colan…:\tDo you want to consult with your attorney?\nNicole Chase:\tCan I do that?\nDetective Colan…:\tSure.\nNicole Chase:\tI just want to make sure that I might even still have a chance at least of getting some type of justice.\nRachel de Leon:\tThree weeks after her interview with Colangelo, Nicole goes back to the station. She’s there to officially revise her statement and turn in printouts of texts which Colangelo asked her for. A dispatcher tells her Colangelo’s busy and he’ll reach out if he needs her. She never hears back from him and emails the detective twice to follow up. By this time, Colangelo has already submitted a warrant for her arrest and when he finally emails her back, he doesn’t tell her that. It’s been two and a half months since Nicole has told Detective Colangelo the full story. She gets a call from him, and she can’t believe what she’s hearing.\nNicole Chase:\tYou have a warrant out for arrest, you need to come into the station. And I just held that phone and in my head, I have no idea what a warrant for my arrest is for because I haven’t done anything wrong.\nRachel de Leon:\tThe charge, making a false statement to a police officer. She turns herself in later that day.\nSpeaker 1:\tNicole started out as a victim reporting an alleged crime to the police. Then a detective lied to her and now she’s being charged for lying to him. When we come back, Nicole fights back. That’s next on Reveal.\n\tFrom the Center for Investigative Reporting in PRX, this is Reveal. I’m Al Letson.

Christopher Marquez was knocked unconscious on Feb. 12 while leaving a restaurant in Chinatown. He told Marine Corps Times that prior to the attack, a group of people was very confrontational with him and asked him \"if I think that black lives mattered.\"\nMarquez, a Bronze Star with combat valor recipient, Mraquez said he does not condone people citing the attack on him to make racial slurs on social media. He also would like the Black Lives Matter movement to condemn what happened to him because he feels the mugging was racially motivated.\n\"Even though this was a racially motivated attack, more violence or hate is not the answer,\" Marquez said Thursday in an email to Marine Corps Times. \"These people want to create more racism and division in our country because it serves their narrative. The best way to counter this cowardly movement is to be united and not divided.\"\nMarquez said he strongly condemns any acts of retaliation and encourages people to have faith in the Washington DC police department and judicial system.\nThe police report of the Feb. 12 incident does not ascribe a motive to Marquez' attackers. In the brief narrative of events, police wrote that the suspects began to argue with Marquez and called him a racist. The police report quotes Marquez as responding by saying, \"I am not even talking to you and that's your opinion.\"\nPolice released surveillance footage on Thursday showing three people they want to speak with in connection with the attack...[Content truncated]",

He remembers being accosted at the McDonald's in Washington's Chinatown neighborhood by five people between 16 and 21 years old. Most were men or boys. One may have been female.\n“The kids were asking me if I think that black lives mattered,” Marquez said on Monday. “I was ignoring them, just because I felt intimidated. I felt how they approached me, it was very hostile. I felt they were really trying to intimidate me and just trying to start a confrontation with me.”\nThe police report does not include a description of the people involved with the incident, which was first reported by .

Christopher Marquez was knocked unconscious on Feb. 12 while leaving a restaurant in Chinatown. He told Marine Corps Times that prior to the attack, a group of people was very confrontational with him and asked him \"if I think that black lives mattered.\"\nMarquez, a Bronze Star with combat valor recipient, Mraquez said he does not condone people citing the attack on him to make racial slurs on social media. He also would like the Black Lives Matter movement to condemn what happened to him because he feels the mugging was racially motivated.\n\"Even though this was a racially motivated attack, more violence or hate is not the answer,\" Marquez said Thursday in an email to Marine Corps Times. \"These people want to create more racism and division in our country because it serves their narrative. The best way to counter this cowardly movement is to be united and not divided.\"\nMarquez said he strongly condemns any acts of retaliation and encourages people to have faith in the Washington DC police department and judicial system.\nThe police report of the Feb. 12 incident does not ascribe a motive to Marquez' attackers. In the brief narrative of events, police wrote that the suspects began to argue with Marquez and called him a racist. The police report quotes Marquez as responding by saying, \"I am not even talking to you and that's your opinion.\"\nPolice released surveillance footage on Thursday showing three people they want to speak with in connection with the attack...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What are the identities and affiliations of the suspects arrested for the assault on Marquez?",
        "Answer": "The identities and affiliations of the suspects arrested for the assault on Christopher Marquez are described in the following ways:\n\n1. **Identities of the Suspects**: Two suspects, a 17-year-old girl and a 17-year-old boy, were charged in connection with the attack on Marquez. Police had been looking for at least four people in total linked to this incident, suggesting that others may have been involved. The attackers were described as teenagers, primarily male, with some reports suggesting at least one female was also present during the assault.\n\n2. **Affiliations**: While Marquez claimed the attack involved racial overtones and he perceived it to relate to the Black Lives Matter movement—asserted when they confronted him about whether \"black lives matter\"—the police did not confirm any direct affiliations between the arrested suspects and organized movements like Black Lives Matter. The lack of confirmation regarding the suspects' ties to such movements indicates that while the interaction had a provocative racial element, it wasn't legally framed in that context, especially since they were not charged with hate crimes.\n\nIn summary, the suspects identified in the assault were two 17-year-olds, but further affiliations with the Black Lives Matter movement remain unsubstantiated by evidence.",
