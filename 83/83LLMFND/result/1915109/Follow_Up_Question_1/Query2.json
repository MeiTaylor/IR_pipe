One can only hope that he continues telling tales for many years to come.\n!\nGeorge Orwell’s _Animal Farm_ is famous for the quote “Some animals are more equal than others.” Someone should write an update called _American Farm_ that includes the line _“Some hate crimes are more equal than others”_ after the Washington, D.C., attack of war hero Christopher Marquez.\nMost media outlets have not covered the Feb. 12 attack of Marquez, who served eight years on active duty between 2003 and 2011. In short, the Bronze Star recipient sat down to eat in a McDonald’s in the nation’s capital and was accosted by a group of teens demanding to know if he thought “black lives matter.”\nLike most sane people, he tried to ignore them and just eat his burger. _He was promptly ambushed and robbed upon exiting the restaurant._\n“I believe this was a hate crime and I was targeted because of my skin color,” Marquez told the  Feb. 15. “Too many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the mainstream media refuses to report on it.”\n!\nSuspects arrested in connection with Christopher Marquez’s assault and robbery will not be charged with a hate crime, despite harassing him with racial questions prior to their attack. (Photo: D.C. Metropolitan Police Department)\nThere are two very interesting facts about Marquez’s case:\n1.  Cops finally arrested and charge two individuals in connection with the incident, but _they  — even though they were explicitly harassing him about race and calling him “racist” before the attack._\n2.  President Obama, who always seems eager to weigh in on race-related crimes, _somehow can’t find his voice when it comes to Black Lives Matter supporters who beat a Marine veteran unconscious and stole $400, a VA medical card, and three credit cards from his back pocket just miles from the White House._ What did his assailants spend the stolen cash on, you ask? Answer: liquor, a Five Guys burgers, and products from Walmart.\nRegular readers of this blog may remember the case of , who was attacked by a similar group of kids on the DC Metro Green Line in 2011. They may also remember  on the Green Line from September 17, 2011.\nI wrote then:\n> As I came home late from work on the D.C. Metro Green line, an inebriated older man...[Content truncated]",

One can only hope that he continues telling tales for many years to come.\n!\nGeorge Orwell’s _Animal Farm_ is famous for the quote “Some animals are more equal than others.” Someone should write an update called _American Farm_ that includes the line _“Some hate crimes are more equal than others”_ after the Washington, D.C., attack of war hero Christopher Marquez.\nMost media outlets have not covered the Feb. 12 attack of Marquez, who served eight years on active duty between 2003 and 2011. In short, the Bronze Star recipient sat down to eat in a McDonald’s in the nation’s capital and was accosted by a group of teens demanding to know if he thought “black lives matter.”\nLike most sane people, he tried to ignore them and just eat his burger. _He was promptly ambushed and robbed upon exiting the restaurant._\n“I believe this was a hate crime and I was targeted because of my skin color,” Marquez told the  Feb. 15. “Too many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the mainstream media refuses to report on it.”\n!\nSuspects arrested in connection with Christopher Marquez’s assault and robbery will not be charged with a hate crime, despite harassing him with racial questions prior to their attack. (Photo: D.C. Metropolitan Police Department)\nThere are two very interesting facts about Marquez’s case:\n1.  Cops finally arrested and charge two individuals in connection with the incident, but _they  — even though they were explicitly harassing him about race and calling him “racist” before the attack._\n2.  President Obama, who always seems eager to weigh in on race-related crimes, _somehow can’t find his voice when it comes to Black Lives Matter supporters who beat a Marine veteran unconscious and stole $400, a VA medical card, and three credit cards from his back pocket just miles from the White House._ What did his assailants spend the stolen cash on, you ask? Answer: liquor, a Five Guys burgers, and products from Walmart.\nRegular readers of this blog may remember the case of , who was attacked by a similar group of kids on the DC Metro Green Line in 2011. They may also remember  on the Green Line from September 17, 2011.\nI wrote then:\n> As I came home late from work on the D.C. Metro Green line, an inebriated older man...[Content truncated]",

McDonald's: 'Stop the racism'\n===================================================================\nBy Jeff Schogol\n Feb 19, 2016\n!:quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/archetype/56OD67PEUBBGROBV7OQCTPEPZ4.jpg)\nThe Marine Iraq War veteran decorated Marine who was assaulted and robbed outside a McDonald’s in Washington, D.C., McDonald’s wants everyone to stop using what happened to him as an excuse to inflame racial tensions.\nFormer Sgt. Christopher Marquez was knocked unconscious on Feb. 12 while leaving a restaurant in Chinatown. He told Marine Corps Times that prior to the attack, a group of people was very confrontational with him and asked him \"if I think that black lives mattered.\"\nMarquez, a Bronze Star with combat valor recipient, Mraquez said he does not condone people citing the attack on him to make racial slurs on social media. He also would like the Black Lives Matter movement to condemn what happened to him because he feels the mugging was racially motivated.\n\"Even though this was a racially motivated attack, more violence or hate is not the answer,\" Marquez said Thursday in an email to Marine Corps Times. \"These people want to create more racism and division in our country because it serves their narrative. The best way to counter this cowardly movement is to be united and not divided.\"\nMarquez said he strongly condemns any acts of retaliation and encourages people to have faith in the Washington DC police department and judicial system.\nThe police report of the Feb. 12 incident does not ascribe a motive to Marquez' attackers. In the brief narrative of events, police wrote that the suspects began to argue with Marquez and called him a racist. The police report quotes Marquez as responding by saying, \"I am not even talking to you and that's your opinion.\"\nPolice released surveillance footage on Thursday showing three people they want to speak with in connection with the attack...[Content truncated]",

Bradley Kasal out of Fallujah’s infamous “Hell House.”\nMarquez, who served in the Marine Corps from 2003 to 2011, told police he was assaulted on Friday around 10:30 p.m. while eating at a McDonald's, according to a Metropolitan Police Department report.\nMarquez said he believes the attack was racially motivated. He remembers being accosted at the McDonald's in Washington's Chinatown neighborhood by five people between 16 and 21 years old. Most were men or boys.

I felt how they approached me, it was very hostile. I felt they were really trying to intimidate me and just trying to start a confrontation with me.”\nThe police report does not include a description of the people involved with the incident, which was first reported by .

Ct. 2434 (2013) The standard for employer liability for hostile work environment harassment depends typically on whether or not the harasser is the victim's supervisor.

Discrimination against a person because of his or her ancestry can violate Title VII’s prohibition against race discrimination. Note that there can be considerable overlap between “race” and “national origin,” but they are not identical. For example, discrimination against a Chinese American might be targeted at her Asian ancestry and not her Chinese national origin. In that case, she would have a claim of discrimination based on race, not national origin.\n*   **Physical Characteristics:** Employment discrimination based on a person’s physical characteristics associated with race, such as a person’s color, hair, facial features, height and weight.\n*   **Race-linked Illness:** Discrimination based on race-linked illnesses. For example, sickle cell anemia is a genetically-transmitted disease that affects primarily persons of African descent. Other diseases, while not linked directly to race or ethnicity, may nevertheless have a disproportionate impact. For example, Native Hawaiians have a disproportionately high incidence of diabetes. If the employer applies facially neutral standards to exclude treatment for conditions or risks that disproportionately affect employees on the basis of race or ethnicity, the employer must show that the standards are based on generally accepted medical criteria.\n*   **Culture:** Employment discrimination because of cultural characteristics related to race or ethnicity. Title VII prohibits employment discrimination against a person because of cultural characteristics often linked to race or ethnicity, such as a person’s name, cultural dress and grooming practices, or accent or manner of speech. For example, an employment decision based on a person having a so-called “Black accent,” or “sounding White,” violates Title VII if the accent or manner of speech does not materially interfere with the ability to perform job duties.\n*   **Perception:** Employment discrimination against an individual based on a belief that the individual is a member of a particular racial group, regardless of how the individual identifies himself. Discrimination against an individual based on a perception of his or her race violates Title VII even if that perception is wrong.\n*   **Association:** Employment discrimination against an individual because of his/her association with someone of a particular race. For example, it is unlawful to discriminate against a White person because he or she is married to an African American or has a multiracial child, or because he or she maintains friendships or otherwise associates with persons of a certain race.\n*   **Subgroup or “Race Plus”:** Title VII prohibits discrimination against a subgroup of persons in a racial group because they have certain attributes in addition to their race. Thus, for example, it...[Content truncated]",
