She was facing a  of as much as three years in prison.\nWhen it comes to the food industry, it's not always easy being cheesy. That's the takeaway from  detailing the use of cellulose (aka wood pulp) in shredded cheese products in the U.S. The use of fillers like cellulose is hotly contested, but perhaps not for the reason you might think.\nAn FDA investigation found that a Pennsylvania company, Castle Cheese Inc., had doctored its so-called \"Parmesan\" with a mix of cheap cheddar cheese and cellulose (also known as wood pulp). The President of the company is currently facing a hefty fine and prison time for  the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\nIt's really a kind of consumer fraud.\nWhile much of the media's focus has been on the wood pulp, cellulose is in fact a very common food additive. The legality has more to do with the fact that the cheese is improperly labeled: The FDA's  regarding Parmesan requires that each ingredient be listed on the label (with the exception of animal, plant or microbial enzymes, which can simply be declared \"enzymes\").\nNora Weiser, executive director of the American Cheese Society, says cellulose isn't found in wheels of cheese, but in shredded varieties, where it's used as an anti-caking agent. \"It is a legal, food-grade additive,\" she says. \"It keeps the grated cheese products from clumping.\"\nAccording to Jaydee Hanson, Policy Director at the Center for Food Safety, the FDA allows cheese products to contain up to four percent cellulose. Any more than that might skirt the law, but Hanson says it's likely not all that harmful. \"You...[Content truncated]",

It sounds like a silly nursery rhyme, but let's take it as a serious question for a moment because, , not only is grated Parmesan cheese allowed to contain cellulose, an anti-clumping agent made from wood pulp, but the percentage of cellulose in some products may surprise you.\nIn light of recent court proceedings where a Pennsylvania cheesemaker is expected to plead guilty to selling \"100 percent grated Parmesan\" that was actually made entirely from cheaper Swiss, mozzarella and white cheddar cheese, as well as cellulose filler, Bloomberg Business decided to dig into the scandalous world of grated cheese.\nNeil Schuman of Arthur Schuman Inc, America's largest hard Italian cheese seller, told Bloomberg he believes that 20 percent of the grated parmesan on the market is mislabeled. \"The tipping point was grated cheese, where less than 40 percent of the product was actually a cheese product,\" he said. \"Consumers are innocent, and they're not getting what they bargained for. And that's just wrong.\"\nOf course, clumpy grated parmesan isn't awesome either, so some cellulose is allowed and acceptable when in the 2 to 4 percent range, according to one cheese expert. But Bloomberg decided to test a few brands to see where they fall, and though they didn't turn up any chunks of discarded Ikea furniture, many failed to land in that range.\nBased on their results, Essential Everyday 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese from Jewel-Osco landed at 8.8 percent cellulose. Great Value 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese from Walmart clocked in at 7.8 percent. Even Whole Foods, despite not listing cellulose as an ingredient, had 0.3 percent of the filler. And the extremely common Kraft had 3.8 percent cellulose.\nAll the brands but Kraft told Bloomberg they were investigating the matter. Kraft, meanwhile, said they were \"committed to the quality of our products.\" It's worth noting that the FDA could step in on these matters, but in general, they prioritize health risks over woody cheese.\nSo though the old adage is \"read the label,\" for consumers, that might not do much. The best bet is probably to buy actual parmesan cheese and grate it yourself. Then you can add as much wood as you'd like.\n\\\\]\n*   \nWas this page helpful?\nThanks for your feedback!\nTell us why!\nOther\nSubmit \nRelated Articles\n----------------...[Content truncated]",

Whole Foods 365 brand didn’t list cellulose as an ingredient on the label, but still tested at 0.3%. Kraft had 3.8%.”\nDean Sommer, a cheese technologist at the Center for Dairy Research in Madison, Wisconsin, told Bloomberg that cellulose is a safe additive and an acceptable level is 2% to 4%.\nAmy Bentley, a professor in the department of nutrition at New York University, said cellulose is not necessarily dangerous, and could possibly be healthy. Cellulose is considered to be a fiber and appears in some laxative products and drinks, she said. Bentley compared the grated parmesan to cheese products like Velveeta – not pure cheese, but still safe to consume.\n“It could possibly be healthy, but people don’t usually think that grated cheese is where their source of fiber is coming from,” Bentley said. “Could it be toxic? I don’t think so.”\nHowever, just because cellulose figures prominently in grated parmesan, people shouldn’t turn to it as a source for fiber intake, she said. “It’s cheese, it’s not Metamuc...[Content truncated]",

She was facing a  of as much as three years in prison.\nWhen it comes to the food industry, it's not always easy being cheesy. That's the takeaway from  detailing the use of cellulose (aka wood pulp) in shredded cheese products in the U.S. The use of fillers like cellulose is hotly contested, but perhaps not for the reason you might think.\nAn FDA investigation found that a Pennsylvania company, Castle Cheese Inc., had doctored its so-called \"Parmesan\" with a mix of cheap cheddar cheese and cellulose (also known as wood pulp). The President of the company is currently facing a hefty fine and prison time for  the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\nIt's really a kind of consumer fraud.\nWhile much of the media's focus has been on the wood pulp, cellulose is in fact a very common food additive. The legality has more to do with the fact that the cheese is improperly labeled: The FDA's  regarding Parmesan requires that each ingredient be listed on the label (with the exception of animal, plant or microbial enzymes, which can simply be declared \"enzymes\").\nNora Weiser, executive director of the American Cheese Society, says cellulose isn't found in wheels of cheese, but in shredded varieties, where it's used as an anti-caking agent. \"It is a legal, food-grade additive,\" she says. \"It keeps the grated cheese products from clumping.\"\nAccording to Jaydee Hanson, Policy Director at the Center for Food Safety, the FDA allows cheese products to contain up to four percent cellulose. Any more than that might skirt the law, but Hanson says it's likely not all that harmful. \"You...[Content truncated]"

            "content": "[Content truncated]... grated Parmesan should have wood? It sounds like a silly nursery rhyme, but let's take it as a serious question for a moment because, , not only is grated Parmesan cheese allowed to contain cellulose, an anti-clumping agent made from wood pulp, but the percentage of cellulose in some products may surprise you.\nIn light of recent court proceedings where a Pennsylvania cheesemaker is expected to plead guilty to selling \"100 percent grated Parmesan\" that was actually made entirely from cheaper Swiss, mozzarella and white cheddar cheese, as well as cellulose filler, Bloomberg Business decided to dig into the scandalous world of grated cheese.\nNeil Schuman of Arthur Schuman Inc, America's largest hard Italian cheese seller, told Bloomberg he believes that 20 percent of the grated parmesan on the market is mislabeled. \"The tipping point was grated cheese, where less than 40 percent of the product was actually a cheese product,\" he said. \"Consumers are innocent, and they're not getting what they bargained for. And that's just wrong.\"\nOf course, clumpy grated parmesan isn't awesome either, so some cellulose is allowed and acceptable when in the 2 to 4 percent range, according to one cheese expert. But Bloomberg decided to test a few brands to see where they fall, and though they didn't turn up any chunks of discarded Ikea furniture, many failed to land in that range.\nBased on their results, Essential Everyday 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese from Jewel-Osco landed at 8.8 percent cellulose. Great Value 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese from Walmart clocked in at 7.8 percent. Even Whole Foods, despite not listing cellulose as an ingredient, had 0.3 percent of the filler. And the extremely common Kraft had 3.8 percent cellulose.\nAll the brands but Kraft told Bloomberg they were investigating the matter. Kraft, meanwhile, said they were \"committed to the quality of our products.\" It's worth noting that the FDA could step in on these matters, but in general, they prioritize health risks over woody cheese.\nSo though the old adage is \"read the label,\" for consumers, that might not do much. The best bet is probably to buy actual parmesan cheese and grate it yourself. Then you can add as much wood as you'd like.\n\\\\]\n*   \nWas this page helpful?\nThanks for your feedback!\nTell us why!\nOther\nSubmit \nRelated Articles\n----------------...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "Is it true that wood pulp is used in the production of certain parmesan cheeses?",
        "Answer": "Yes, it is true that wood pulp is used in the production of certain Parmesan cheeses, specifically in some shredded cheese products. This wood pulp is commonly known as cellulose, which serves as an anti-caking agent to prevent clumping in grated cheeses. The FDA allows cheese products to contain up to 4% cellulose, and it is typically not harmful in those amounts. However, the controversy arises from cases where some brands have misrepresented their products as '100% Parmesan' while including significant amounts of cellulose, wood pulp, or other cheaper cheese types. A notable incident involved Castle Cheese Inc., which was found by the FDA to have doctored its Parmesan products with a mix of cheaper cheddar and cellulose, leading to legal repercussions for the company. Research has indicated that a considerable portion of grated Parmesan on the market may not contain authentic Parmesan cheese at all. One estimate suggests that around 20% of grated Parmesan could be mislabeled, with some containing over 8% cellulose, which exceeds the FDA's recommended limit. Thus, while cellulose (wood pulp) is an approved additive and can be legally present in small amounts in shredded cheese, many products labeled as Parmesan do not adhere to the standards that define true Parmesan cheese, leading to both consumer fraud and health considerations.",
