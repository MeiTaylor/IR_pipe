There\u2019s too many laws and regulations for that to fly.\nBut there is some truth behind these reports and several cheese companies including Kraft Heinz, Walmart, Jewel-Osco owner Albertsons, SuperValu and the manufacturer Icco Cheese have been involved in a lawsuit over their 100% grated Parmesan cheese.\nBecause guess what\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s not 100% Parmesan cheese.\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n    *   \n    *   \n### So, is there wood pulp in my\u00a0cheese?\n!\nThe short answer is\u200a\u2014\u200ano. This is one of those exaggerations.\nBut, there is a reason for the lawsuits. The fight is over a food-safe additive called cellulose.\nNow, you might be thinking there\u2019s no cellulose in my Parmesan cheese, but if you flip over the container you\u2019ll see cellulose on nearly every ingredient list for grated or shredded Parmesan cheese.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if the container says \u2018100% grated Parmesan cheese\u2019 it still contains cellulose. It\u2019s not 100% cheese.\nNow, you\u2019re probably thinking this is incredibly deceptive or possibly a straight up lie.\nBut with food law, the difference of one word, in this case \u2018grated,\u2019 can have huge implications.\nAnother example is the difference between a label stating \u2018chocolate\u2019 versus \u2018chocolatey.\u2019 The former is real chocolate while the later is a mimic of chocolate called compound coating.\n### Then, what does \u2018100% grated Parmesan cheese\u2019\u00a0mean?\nThe key word in this claim is \u2018grated.\u2019 If a product says \u2018100% cheese\u2019 it contains only cheese, but if you throw in the word \u2018grated\u2019 it has a whole new definition according to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).\nIn the food industry, the CFR is essentially the bible. It\u2019s the book that defines what certain foods are and what ingredients can be included. And according to the CFR a  can include the following _optional_ ingredients:\n*   Antimycotics\n*   Anticaking agents\n*   Spices\n*   Flavorings\nSo, legally the claim of \u2018100% grated cheese\u2019 is correct, even if an anti-caking agent like cellulose is used. However, to most people this would be seen as pretty misleading...[Content truncated]",

She was facing a\u00a0 of as much as three years in prison.\nWhen it comes to the food industry, it's not always easy being cheesy. That's the takeaway from  detailing the use of cellulose (aka wood pulp) in shredded cheese products in the U.S. The use of fillers like cellulose is hotly contested, but perhaps not for the reason you might think.\nAn FDA investigation found that a Pennsylvania company, Castle Cheese Inc., had doctored its so-called \"Parmesan\" with a mix of cheap cheddar cheese and cellulose (also known as wood pulp). The President of the company is currently facing a hefty fine and prison time for  the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\nIt's really a kind of consumer fraud.\nWhile much of the media's focus has been on the wood pulp, cellulose is in fact a very common food additive. The legality has more to do with the fact that the cheese is improperly labeled: The FDA's  regarding Parmesan requires that each ingredient be listed on the label (with the exception of animal, plant or microbial enzymes, which can simply be declared \"enzymes\").\nNora Weiser, executive director of the American Cheese Society, says cellulose isn't found in wheels of cheese, but in shredded varieties, where it's used as an anti-caking agent. \"It is a legal, food-grade additive,\" she says. \"It keeps the grated cheese products from clumping.\"\nAccording to Jaydee Hanson, Policy Director at the Center for Food Safety, the FDA allows cheese products to contain up to four percent cellulose. Any more than that might skirt the law, but Hanson says it's likely not all that harmful. \"You...[Content truncated]",

My Parmesan cheese is actually chock-full of\u2026 wood?\nThat\u2019s the question that many Americans are asking themselves after  from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed that Castle Cheese, Inc., a Pennsylvania-based company, had been adding wood pulp \u2013  \u2013 to their 100 percent real Parmesan cheese products for years. And not just a tiny bit of wood pulp either; in , a whole lot of wood pulp.\nAmericans everywhere \u2013 to put it one way \u2013 are stumped. But don\u2019t throw out that cylindrical jar of grated cheese that\u2019s been lurking in the back of your refrigerator just yet \u2013 the findings so far may only pertain to a few select grated cheeses on American store shelves. Still, Americans should heed caution.\nWhat Did the FDA\u2019s Investigative Report Turn up?\n------------------------------------------------\nBack in winter of 2012, the FDA, tipped off by an anonymous source, paid a surprise visit to an unsuspecting cheese factory in rural Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania. : That Castle Cheese, Inc. was processing, labeling, and selling misbranded food. Worse, the FDA found that Castle had been, in effect, \u201ccutting\u201d their 100 Percent Real Parmesan Cheese product with cut-rate cheese substitutes and fillers such as wood pulp. When their cheese-making process was complete, Castle then shipped their cheeses across the U.S. to some of the largest grocery retailers in the country.\nIt all may sound like a joke at first, but such findings are not just baffling or puzzling \u2013 they are outright despicable \u2013 and they speak to a much larger issue in the American food industry. To dupe the public into purchasing a product that they\u2019re led to believe is 100 percent of anything \u2013 when it\u2019s not \u2013 is not only inaccurate or misleading, it\u2019s a crime. Perhaps the worst crime of all: dishonesty.\nThe substitute that grated Parmesan suppliers have been using in their grated cheese products is called \u201c,\u201d which is an anti-clumping agent derived from wood pulp.\nThe FDA\u2019s investigation into cellulose usage in the cheese industry has struck a nerve and sparked more widespread skepticism across this particular market...[Content truncated]",

Some packaged grated Parmesan cheese products contain too little cheese and too much cellulose, according to independent laboratory tests noted in the report.\nKraft Heinz cheese, labeled \"100% Grated Parmesan Cheese,\" was found to have 3.8 percent cellulose. Between 2 and 4 percent is considered to be an \"acceptable level,\" according to the _Bloomberg_ story. Now, Kraft Heinz is among the companies named in a lawsuit for using cellulose filler in its \"100% Grated Parmesan Cheese\" product.\nOn February 27, an Illinois woman filed a class action lawsuit against Kraft Heinz in federal district court, claiming violations of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act. Similar lawsuits were filed last week against Kraft Heinz in federal courts in New York, Missouri and California.\nHowever, the plant fiber is legal in the U.S. and is an FDA approved anti-clumping ingredient for pre-grated cheese.\nFDA recognizes cellulose as \"safe additive,\" and it can be used at levels from 2 percent to 4 percent. Used throughout the food industry, cellulose gives foods like ice cream a creamier mouthfeel, and it's used in good quality grated cheeses, as well as not-so-great quality cheeses.\nWalmart was also sued last week over cellulose, an anti-clumping agent derived from wood chips, in its grated Parmesan cheese.\nKraft Heinz spokesman Michael Mullen recently stated that cellulose was FDA-approved, and that the Kraft Heinz cheese was still within the levels of cellulose considered acceptable.\u00a0\"We are committed to the quality of our products, and we are also committed to listening to our consumers,\" Mullen said in an email to the _Chicago Tribune_ last week. \"We know the top complaint people have about grated Parmesan cheese is clumping of the cheese.\"\nTo be sure cheese is real Parmesan, the words \"Parmigiano-Reggiano\" should be printed on the rind. When shopping for pre-grated Parmesan, consumers are advised to look for American producers with good reputations. \"Learn the names of reputable brands that offer pre-grated Parmesan, like Sartori and BelGioioso, which are both from Wisconsin, and Arthur Schuman, Inc. from New Jersey, which is the largest importer of hard Italian cheeses,\" says cheese...[Content truncated]",

There is a long list of definitions of a variety of different types of cheeses, describing what they must be made of, how they are made, what additives may be used and in what quantities, and so forth. If a product is marketed as \u201cparmesan cheese\u201d and doesn't meet the definition, the producer can be fined.\nYou can read the definition yourself at .\nParmesan cheese is pretty much milk, enzymes, and salt. The other things allowed are only allowed in fractions of a percent. Wood pulp is not on the list.\nThe grated parmesan cheese in the ubiquitous green cans is not just parmesan cheese according to the above definition. Kraft brand lists 3 ingredients: parmesan cheese, cellulose powder, and potassium sorbate. While the exact quantities aren't listed, other sources suggest that it is at least 95% parmesan cheese, with the other ingredients at most 3-5% overall.\nIt's the cellulose powder that people, especially people who want to criticize American food, are referring to when they claim it contains \u201cwood pulp\u201d. While wood pulp is mostly cellulose, that is true of most plants. Cellulose is a non-digestible form of carbohydrate that plants use to make their structure, their cell walls. It's everywhere, and usually shows up on nutritional labels as \u201cdietary fiber\u201d. It is not bad to eat. It is in the green cans to help keep the cheese from clumping up.\nI don't know where Kraft gets its cellulose powder from. It might get it from wood pulp, but if so, it is food-grade wood pulp. And it is nowhere near 40%.",
