It sounds like a silly nursery rhyme, but let's take it as a serious question for a moment because, , not only is grated Parmesan cheese allowed to contain cellulose, an anti-clumping agent made from wood pulp, but the percentage of cellulose in some products may surprise you.\nIn light of recent court proceedings where a Pennsylvania cheesemaker is expected to plead guilty to selling \"100 percent grated Parmesan\" that was actually made entirely from cheaper Swiss, mozzarella and white cheddar cheese, as well as cellulose filler, Bloomberg Business decided to dig into the scandalous world of grated cheese.\nNeil Schuman of Arthur Schuman Inc, America's largest hard Italian cheese seller, told Bloomberg he believes that 20 percent of the grated parmesan on the market is mislabeled. \"The tipping point was grated cheese, where less than 40 percent of the product was actually a cheese product,\" he said. \"Consumers are innocent, and they're not getting what they bargained for. And that's just wrong.\"\nOf course, clumpy grated parmesan isn't awesome either, so some cellulose is allowed and acceptable when in the 2 to 4 percent range, according to one cheese expert. But Bloomberg decided to test a few brands to see where they fall, and though they didn't turn up any chunks of discarded Ikea furniture, many failed to land in that range.\nBased on their results, Essential Everyday 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese from Jewel-Osco landed at 8.8 percent cellulose. Great Value 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese from Walmart clocked in at 7.8 percent. Even Whole Foods, despite not listing cellulose as an ingredient, had 0.3 percent of the filler. And the extremely common Kraft had 3.8 percent cellulose.\nAll the brands but Kraft told Bloomberg they were investigating the matter. Kraft, meanwhile, said they were \"committed to the quality of our products.\" It's worth noting that the FDA could step in on these matters, but in general, they prioritize health risks over woody cheese.\nSo though the old adage is \"read the label,\" for consumers, that might not do much. The best bet is probably to buy actual parmesan cheese and grate it yourself. Then you can add as much wood as you'd like.\n\\\\]\n*   \nWas this page helpful?\nThanks for your feedback!\nTell us why!\nOther\nSubmit \nRelated Articles\n----------------...[Content truncated]",

But now Kraft Heinz and others were named in a lawsuit for using the filler in its \"100% Grated Parmesan Cheese.\"\n*   \n*   \n*   (javascript:void\\(0\\))\n*   (javascript:void\\(0\\))\n*   (javascript:void\\(0\\))\n*   (javascript:void\\(0\\))\nThe Parmesan cheese/wood pulp plot is thickening. Using research from FDA investigations and its own independent tests, _Bloomberg News,_ reported recently that many well-known Parmesan cheese brands use wood pulp and cellulose as low-cost fillers, even when they are advertised as \"100% Parmesan Cheese.\" _Bloomberg_ earlier reported it had store-bought grated cheese tested for wood-pulp content by an independent laboratory. Some packaged grated Parmesan cheese products contain too little cheese and too much cellulose, according to independent laboratory tests noted in the report.\nKraft Heinz cheese, labeled \"100% Grated Parmesan Cheese,\" was found to have 3.8 percent cellulose. Between 2 and 4 percent is considered to be an \"acceptable level,\" according to the _Bloomberg_ story. Now, Kraft Heinz is among the companies named in a lawsuit for using cellulose filler in its \"100% Grated Parmesan Cheese\" product.\nOn February 27, an Illinois woman filed a class action lawsuit against Kraft Heinz in federal district court, claiming violations of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act. Similar lawsuits were filed last week against Kraft...[Content truncated]",

There are no known harmful side effects from adding it to food, and it's completely legal.\n\"Cellulose is a non-digestible plant fiber, and we actually happen to need non-digestible vegetable fiber in our food—that's why people eat bran flakes and psyllium husks,\" says **Jeff Potter**, author of .\nAnd though it makes for more sensational headlines, it's not quite accurate to claim that something made with cellulose is part \"wood pulp,\" as implied in a rather breathless Bloomberg News headline. () Companies that manufacture cellulose create it from a variety of sources, from wood pulp to asparagus.\n**\"Basically anything with plant stuff in it,\"** Potter says.\nSo could part of the faux-Parmesan cheese you eat once have had a tire-swing hanging from it? Sure. (We say faux-Parm because in the U.S., cheese only has to be made of cow's milk and meet a certain fat and water content, whereas **really real Parmigiano-Reggiano only comes from northern Italy** and is made and sold by a strictly controlled group of government-approved cheesemakers.)

She was facing a  of as much as three years in prison.\nWhen it comes to the food industry, it's not always easy being cheesy. That's the takeaway from  detailing the use of cellulose (aka wood pulp) in shredded cheese products in the U.S. The use of fillers like cellulose is hotly contested, but perhaps not for the reason you might think.\nAn FDA investigation found that a Pennsylvania company, Castle Cheese Inc., had doctored its so-called \"Parmesan\" with a mix of cheap cheddar cheese and cellulose (also known as wood pulp). The President of the company is currently facing a hefty fine and prison time for  the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\nIt's really a kind of consumer fraud.\nWhile much of the media's focus has been on the wood pulp, cellulose is in fact a very common food additive. The legality has more to do with the fact that the cheese is improperly labeled: The FDA's  regarding Parmesan requires that each ingredient be listed on the label (with the exception of animal, plant or microbial enzymes, which can simply be declared \"enzymes\").\nNora Weiser, executive director of the American Cheese Society, says cellulose isn't found in wheels of cheese, but in shredded varieties, where it's used as an anti-caking agent. \"It is a legal, food-grade additive,\" she says. \"It keeps the grated cheese products from clumping.\"\nAccording to Jaydee Hanson, Policy Director at the Center for Food Safety, the FDA allows cheese products to contain up to four percent cellulose. Any more than that might skirt the law, but Hanson says it's likely not all that harmful. \"You...[Content truncated]",

Is that so bad?\n============================================================================\nThis article is more than 8 years old\nNews that the FDA has found non-dairy filler ingredients used to make paper in your parmesan cheese isn’t great, but will it kill you? Probably not\nWed 17 Feb 2016 12.18 ESTLast modified on Sat 18 Aug 2018 10.00 EDT\nThe grocery store parmesan cheese in the green-topped plastic container you shake over pasta dishes contains non-dairy filler ingredients like wood pulp, according to a  from Bloomberg.\nIn 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration investigated the Pennsylvania cheese factory Castle  Inc and found the company was doctoring its “100% real parmesan” with filler ingredients like wood pulp, or cheaper cheeses like cheddar, swiss and mozzarella.\nFollowing the FDA’s findings, Bloomberg investigated other store-bought grated parmesan and discovered high percentages of cellulose – essentially powdered wood pulp and the main ingredient in paper – in four different brands.\nBloomberg found that “Essential Everyday 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese, from Jewel-Osco, was 8.8% cellulose, while Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s Great Value 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese registered 7.8%, according to test results. Whole Foods 365 brand didn’t list cellulose as an ingredient on the label, but still tested at 0.3%. Kraft had 3.8%.”\nDean Sommer, a cheese technologist at the Center for Dairy Research in Madison, Wisconsin, told Bloomberg that cellulose is a safe additive and an acceptable level is 2% to 4%.\nAmy Bentley, a professor in the department of nutrition at New York University, said cellulose is not necessarily dangerous, and could possibly be healthy. Cellulose is considered to be a fiber and appears in some laxative products and drinks, she said. Bentley compared the grated parmesan to cheese products like Velveeta – not pure cheese, but still safe to consume.\n“It could possibly be healthy, but people don’t usually think that grated cheese is where their source of fiber is coming from,” Bentley said. “Could it be toxic? I don’t think so.”\nHowever, just because cellulose figures prominently in grated parmesan, people shouldn’t turn to it as a source for fiber intake, she said. “It’s cheese, it’s not Metamuc...[Content truncated]",
