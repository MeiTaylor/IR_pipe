  "CVResult": {
    "Judgment": "Yes",
    "Confidence": "85%",
    "Reason": "The information provided in the video descriptor mentions that 'Castle Cheese is under investigation for mixing wood pulp with their parmesan cheese.' This directly supports the claim that several widely-available cheeses are partially made from wood, specifically referencing a known case of imitation parmesan cheese containing wood pulp. The mention of 'imitation cheese' and the company's long history of supplying this product adds to the reliability of the claim. However, the information is based on an investigation, which suggests that while there is reason to believe there may be truth to the claim, it is still being evaluated. Therefore, the confidence level is high but not absolute."

2024-08-03 14:41:54 - ThreadPoolExecutor-12_0 - INFO - Here's an evaluation of the listed websites based on their credibility, reliability, historical accuracy, and capability to detect and expose fake news. Each website is assigned a quality score out of 10, accompanied by detailed reasoning.

1. **abbeythefoodscientist.com**
   - **Quality Score: 6/10**
   - **Reasoning:** Abbey the Food Scientist presents itself as a food science-oriented website with a mission to educate the public about food chemistry and nutrition. While it has useful content, it’s more focused on personal blogging and may lack the rigorous journalistic fact-checking associated with higher credibility sites. Its factual accuracy may vary depending on individual articles, but it provides some degree of insight into food topics, including controversies.

2. **www.eater.com**
   - **Quality Score: 8/10**
   - **Reasoning:** Eater is a reputable food news and culture platform that covers a wide range of topics including food trends, restaurants, and sometimes food industry controversies. It employs professional journalists and checks information fairly well, contributing to a higher score. However, it may occasionally prioritize entertaining angles over rigorous investigative reporting, which prevents a perfect score.

3. **www.cornucopia.org**
   - **Quality Score: 9/10**
   - **Reasoning:** Cornucopia Institute is known for its advocacy work in sustainable agriculture and food justice. It provides detailed reports and research on agricultural practices, including potential issues like food fraud. Given its focus on transparency, research, and accountability within the food industry, it has a strong reputation and offers valuable insights that help detect misinformation related to food products.

4. **www.sokolovelaw.com**
   - **Quality Score: 5/10**
   - **Reasoning:** Sokolove Law is primarily a personal injury law firm with a blog that occasionally touches on topics relevant to food safety or processing issues. While they may have some useful content, the nature of their business does not position them as authoritative sources for detecting fake news or providing in-depth analysis of food industry claims. The information may be more promotional than factual.

5. **www.foodprocessing.com**
   - **Quality Score: 7/10**
   - **Reasoning:** Food Processing is a trade publication that provides information on the food and beverage industry. It usually features articles on technological advancements, safety regulations, and industry trends. While it presents factual, industry-relevant content, the focus is on industry professionals rather than investigative journalism. There may be less emphasis on broader consumer issues, impacting its overall credibility slightly.

6. **thecounter.org**
   - **Quality Score: 8/10**
   - **Reasoning:** The Counter is a nonprofit news site focused specifically on food issues. It addresses various topics concerning food policy, agriculture, and sustainability with a journalistic approach. Its commitment to well-researched articles enhances its credibility, providing readers with accurate and reliable information, making it a useful resource for detecting misinformation in the food sector.

7. **www.quora.com**
   - **Quality Score: 4/10**
   - **Reasoning:** Quora is a question-and-answer platform where individuals can post various topics and find answers from other users. While it can provide diverse viewpoints, the information is user-generated and not always fact-checked or credible. Misinformation can easily disseminate via this platform, leading to lower reliability in terms of accuracy and truthfulness.

8. **www.washingtonpost.com**
   - **Quality Score: 9/10**
   - **Reasoning:** The Washington Post is a major American daily newspaper with a strong reputation for investigative journalism and fact-checking. It covers a wide range of topics, including food industry controversies and health-related issues. Its editorial standards and history of journalistic integrity contribute to its high score, making it a reliable source for detecting fake news.

9. **www.bonappetit.com**
   - **Quality Score: 8/10**
   - **Reasoning:** Bon Appétit is a well-known food and cooking magazine that often discusses food trends, recipes, and sometimes industry-related issues. It provides a mix of entertainment and useful information. While the magazine is reputable, some content may lean towards lifestyle rather than critical reporting, hence a slightly lower score compared to purely journalistic sources.

10. **drtaylorwallace.com**
    - **Quality Score: 7/10**
    - **Reasoning:** Dr. Taylor Wallace is a food scientist and nutrition expert who provides insights on food science and safety. His content can be informative and backed by scientific principles. However, being a personal website, the content must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis for reliability and trustworthiness. It is valuable for understanding food-related science but does not consistently operate at the level of more established news outlets.

### 3. **www.foodandwine.com**
**Quality Score: 8/10**  
**Explanation:** Food & Wine is a reputable source in the culinary field, known for its quality recipes and food-related articles. It often collaborates with culinary professionals and chefs, providing reliable information. The editorial content is generally well-researched, making this site credible for culinary facts.

**Quality Score: 7/10**  
**Explanation:** Food Processing provides insights into the food production industry, including current trends and technological advancements.

**Explanation:** Reddit is a community-driven platform where users share various content.

There\u2019s too many laws and regulations for that to fly.\\nBut there is some truth behind these reports and several cheese companies including Kraft Heinz, Walmart, Jewel-Osco owner Albertsons, SuperValu and the manufacturer Icco Cheese have been involved in a lawsuit over their 100% grated Parmesan cheese.\\nBecause guess what\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s not 100% Parmesan cheese.\\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n    *   \\n    *   \\n### So, is there wood pulp in my\u00a0cheese?\\n!\\nThe short answer is\u200a\u2014\u200ano. This is one of those exaggerations.\\nBut, there is a reason for the lawsuits. The fight is over a food-safe additive called cellulose.\\nNow, you might be thinking there\u2019s no cellulose in my Parmesan cheese, but if you flip over the container you\u2019ll see cellulose on nearly every ingredient list for grated or shredded Parmesan cheese.\\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if the container says \u2018100% grated Parmesan cheese\u2019 it still contains cellulose. It\u2019s not 100% cheese.\\nNow, you\u2019re probably thinking this is incredibly deceptive or possibly a straight up lie.\\nBut with food law, the difference of one word, in this case \u2018grated,\u2019 can have huge implications.\\nAnother example is the difference between a label stating \u2018chocolate\u2019 versus \u2018chocolatey.\u2019 The former is real chocolate while the later is a mimic of chocolate called compound coating.\\n### Then, what does \u2018100% grated Parmesan cheese\u2019\u00a0mean?\\nThe key word in this claim is \u2018grated.\u2019 If a product says \u2018100% cheese\u2019 it contains only cheese, but if you throw in the word \u2018grated\u2019 it has a whole new definition according to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).\\nIn the food industry, the CFR is essentially the bible. It\u2019s the book that defines what certain foods are and what ingredients can be included. And according to the CFR a  can include the following _optional_ ingredients:\\n*   Antimycotics\\n*   Anticaking agents\\n*   Spices\\n*   Flavorings\\nSo, legally the claim of \u2018100% grated cheese\u2019 is correct, even if an anti-caking agent like cellulose is used.

She was facing a\u00a0 of as much as three years in prison.\\nWhen it comes to the food industry, it's not always easy being cheesy. That's the takeaway from  detailing the use of cellulose (aka wood pulp) in shredded cheese products in the U.S. The use of fillers like cellulose is hotly contested, but perhaps not for the reason you might think.\\nAn FDA investigation found that a Pennsylvania company, Castle Cheese Inc., had doctored its so-called \\\"Parmesan\\\" with a mix of cheap cheddar cheese and cellulose (also known as wood pulp). The President of the company is currently facing a hefty fine and prison time for  the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\\nIt's really a kind of consumer fraud.\\nWhile much of the media's focus has been on the wood pulp, cellulose is in fact a very common food additive. The legality has more to do with the fact that the cheese is improperly labeled: The FDA's  regarding Parmesan requires that each ingredient be listed on the label (with the exception of animal, plant or microbial enzymes, which can simply be declared \\\"enzymes\\\").\\nNora Weiser, executive director of the American Cheese Society, says cellulose isn't found in wheels of cheese, but in shredded varieties, where it's used as an anti-caking agent. \\\"It is a legal, food-grade additive,\\\" she says. \\\"It keeps the grated cheese products from clumping.\\\"\\nAccording to Jaydee Hanson, Policy Director at the Center for Food Safety, the FDA allows cheese products to contain up to four percent cellulose.

The fight is over a food-safe additive called cellulose.\\nNow, you might be thinking there\u2019s no cellulose in my Parmesan cheese, but if you flip over the container you\u2019ll see cellulose on nearly every ingredient list for grated or shredded Parmesan cheese.\\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if the container says \u2018100% grated Parmesan cheese\u2019 it still contains cellulose. It\u2019s not 100% cheese.\\nNow, you\u2019re probably thinking this is incredibly deceptive or possibly a straight up lie.\\nBut with food law, the difference of one word, in this case \u2018grated...[Content truncated]\"\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"evidence2\": {\n            \"title\": \"The Amount of Wood Pulp in Grated Parmesan Cheese May ...\",\n            \"link\": \"https://www.foodandwine.com/news/amount-wood-pulp-grated-parmesan-cheese-may-surprise-you\",\n            \"displayLink\": \"www.foodandwine.com\",\n            \"snippet\": \"Jun 22, 2017 ... ... contain cellulose, an anti-clumping agent made from wood ...

It sounds like a silly nursery rhyme, but let's take it as a serious question for a moment because, , not only is grated Parmesan cheese allowed to contain cellulose, an anti-clumping agent made from wood pulp, but the percentage of cellulose in some products may surprise you.\\nIn light of recent court proceedings where a Pennsylvania cheesemaker is expected to plead guilty to selling \\\"100 percent grated Parmesan\\\" that was actually made entirely from cheaper Swiss, mozzarella and white cheddar cheese, as well as cellulose filler, Bloomberg Business decided to dig into the scandalous world of grated cheese.\\nNeil Schuman of Arthur Schuman Inc, America's largest hard Italian cheese seller, told Bloomberg he believes that 20 percent of the grated parmesan on the market is mislabeled. \\\"The tipping point was grated cheese, where less than 40 percent of the product was actually a cheese product,\\\" he said. \\\"Consumers are innocent, and they're not getting what they bargained for. And that's just wrong.\\\"\\nOf course, clumpy grated parmesan isn't awesome either, so some cellulose is allowed and acceptable when in the 2 to 4 percent range, according to one cheese expert. But Bloomberg decided to test a few brands to see where they fall, and though they didn't turn up any chunks of discarded Ikea furniture, many failed to land in that range.\\nBased on their results, Essential Everyday 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese from Jewel-Osco landed at 8.8 percent cellulose. Great Value 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese from Walmart clocked in at 7.8 percent. Even Whole Foods, despite not listing cellulose as an ingredient, had 0.3 percent of the filler. And the extremely common Kraft had 3.8 percent cellulose.\\nAll the brands but Kraft told Bloomberg they were investigating the matter. Kraft, meanwhile, said they were \\\"committed to the quality of our products.\\\" It's worth noting that the FDA could step in on these matters, but in general, they prioritize health risks over woody cheese.\\nSo though the old adage is \\\"read the label,\\\" for consumers, that might not do much. The best bet is probably to buy actual parmesan cheese and grate it yourself. Then you can add as much wood as you'd like.\\n\\\\\\\\]\\n*   \\nWas this page helpful?\\nThanks for your feedback!\\nTell us why!\\nOther\\nSubmit \\nRelated Articles\\n----------------...[Content truncated]\"\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"evidence3\": {\n            \"title\": \"Kraft Heinz in Lawsuit Over Parmesan Cheese Containing Wood Pulp\",\n            \"link\": \"https://www.foodprocessing.com/home/news/11322101/kraft-heinz-in-lawsuit-over-parmesan-cheese-containing-wood-pulp\",\n            \"displayLink\": \"www.foodprocessing.com\",\n            \"snippet\": \"Mar 2, 2016 ...

That's the takeaway from  detailing the use of cellulose (aka wood pulp) in shredded cheese products in the U.S. The use of fillers like cellulose is hotly contested, but perhaps not for the reason you might think.\\nAn FDA investigation found that a Pennsylvania company, Castle Cheese Inc., had doctored its so-called \\\"Parmesan\\\" with a mix of cheap cheddar cheese and cellulose (also known as wood pulp). The President of the company is currently facing a hefty fine and prison time for  the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\\nIt's really a kind of consumer fraud.\\nWhile much of the media's focus has been on the wood pulp, cellulose is in fact a very common food additive. The legality has more to do with the fact that the cheese is improperly labeled: The FDA's  regarding Parmesan requires that each ingredient be listed on the label (with the exception of animal, plant or microbial enzymes, which can simply be declared \\\"enzymes\\\").\\nNora Weiser, executive director of the American Cheese Society, says cellulose isn't found in wheels of cheese, but in shredded varieties, where it's used as an anti-caking agent. \\\"It is a legal, food-grade additive,\\\" she says. \\\"It keeps the grated cheese products from clumping.\\\"\\nAccording to Jaydee Hanson, Policy Director at the Center for Food Safety, the FDA allows cheese products to contain up to four percent cellulose.

2024-08-03 14:42:19 - ThreadPoolExecutor-12_0 - INFO - Here is the evaluation of the relevance of each evidence to the question regarding whether wood pulp is used in the production of certain parmesan cheeses:

1. **evidence0**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 8
   - **Justification**: This evidence confirms that there is a legal distinction concerning the use of cellulose (wood pulp) in grated cheeses. It explicitly states that cellulose can be found in nearly all grated or shredded Parmesan cheese despite misleading labels claiming they are "100% Parmesan cheese". This closely relates to the claim as it directly addresses the use of wood pulp in Parmesan cheese production, providing specifics about legal definitions concerning food labeling.

2. **evidence1**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 9
   - **Justification**: This evidence summarizes the FDA's investigation into Castle Cheese, which was caught using wood pulp in its so-called Parmesan cheese products. It discusses the legal implications of using such fillers and highlights consumer fraud issues, clearly tying back to the claim about wood pulp being present in Parmesan cheese products. This is highly relevant to understanding the truthfulness of the claim.

3. **evidence2**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 6
   - **Justification**: While this evidence mentions the regulatory use of cellulose and its lack of nutritional benefit, it does not provide specific case examples of Parmesan cheese. Although it acknowledges the use of cellulose in cheese, it lacks depth on legal implications or direct links to major brands, making it less impactful in confirming the claim.

4. **evidence3**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 8
   - **Justification**: This evidence provides a thorough overview of the FDA's findings against Castle Cheese, revealing that they had been misbranding their products and indeed using wood pulp. It informs the reader of the scale of the issue and the direct connection between the product and wood pulp, aligning well with the initial claim.

5. **evidence4**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 7
   - **Justification**: This source discusses the legality of using cellulose in pre-grated cheese and mentions specific instances, including Kraft Heinz. While it confirms that cellulose is commonly included in these products, it does not emphasize wood pulp's role strongly enough to reach higher relevance.

6. **evidence5**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 7
   - **Justification**: This evidence references ongoing lawsuits and consumer deception in the cheese market. It acknowledges that many grated cheese products contain wood pulp, directly supporting the claim. However, it presents a general overview without deep specifics about the claims or the implicated companies.

7. **evidence6**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 5
   - **Justification**: This evidence provides a somewhat casual take on cellulose but lacks strong ties to specific parmesan cheese products. It mentions that products can legally contain additives, including cellulose, which loosely relates to the question but does not add substantial weight.

8. **evidence7**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 9
   - **Justification**: This source discusses the FDA's formal definition of Parmesan cheese, clarifying that wood pulp is not allowed. It connects the legislation to the mislabeling cases, providing a critical perspective on what genuine Parmesan should consist of. This is highly relevant in determining the veracity of the claim.

9. **evidence8**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 6
   - **Justification**: This evidence states that cellulose is added for safety and is non-harmful. While this is useful information, it does not significantly address the question of whether this practice constitutes misleading labeling in Parmesan cheeses.

10. **evidence9**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 7
   - **Justification**: This evidence clarifies that cellulose, derived from wood pulp, is commonly used in cheese production. It provides a perspective on the safety and legality of the use of cellulose but lacks specificity in the context of Parmesan cheese, making it moderately relevant.

These scores and justifications reflect how each evidence helps clarify the truthfulness of the claim that wood pulp is included in some Parmesan cheese products.

2024-08-03 14:42:23 - ThreadPoolExecutor-12_1 - INFO - Here are the relevance scores for each piece of evidence provided:

1. **evidence0**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 8
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses the FDA cracking down on companies selling parmesan cheese that is not 100% cheese, directly suggesting that wood pulp is present in some parmesan cheese. It's relevant because it corroborates the claim that certain parmesan products may include wood pulp, indicating potential mislabeling or adulteration.

2. **evidence1**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 9
   - **Justification**: This evidence explicitly states that while there are regulations, certain cheese companies have been implicated in lawsuits for using cellulose (wood pulp) in their parmesan products, challenging the notion that these products are 100% parmesan. This strongly supports the claim that wood pulp is used in parmesan cheese.

3. **evidence2**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 9
   - **Justification**: It clearly links cellulose, which is derived from wood pulp, to grated parmesan cheese products and provides specific data on its levels across various brands. This information reinforces the claim that wood pulp is a common ingredient in many parmesan cheese products, directly addressing the question.

4. **evidence3**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 8
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses a lawsuit against Kraft Heinz for using cellulose in its parmesan cheese. It indicates that many brands might use wood pulp as a filler, which is pertinent to the question regarding the use of wood pulp in parmesan cheese production.

5. **evidence4**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 7
   - **Justification**: This evidence explains that cellulose, often made from wood pulp, is added to parmesan cheese as a filler, though it downplays its severity. It is relevant but less so since it somewhat trivializes the use of wood pulp, making it seem less concerning.

6. **evidence5**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 6
   - **Justification**: While it mentions that wood pulp has been used in cheese products for a long time, it lacks depth in detailing specific instances or brands. It provides a general acknowledgment of wood pulp's long history in cheese but does not offer concrete examples or implications.

7. **evidence6**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 7
   - **Justification**: This evidence describes an FDA investigation into a specific cheese producer using wood pulp in parmesan cheese. It offers context for the use of wood pulp without sufficiently detailing its prevalence in the broader market, but it still supports the claim.

8. **evidence7**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 8
   - **Justification**: This evidence reports on lab tests revealing that many store-bought parmesan cheeses contain cellulose, highlighting its presence as a filler. It closely correlates with the question about wood pulp's role in parmesan, supporting the claim effectively.

9. **evidence8**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 7
   - **Justification**: This evidence points to multiple lawsuits concerning the presence of wood pulp in parmesan cheese products. However, the focus on legal actions makes it slightly less direct in addressing the specifics of the claim, though still quite relevant.

10. **evidence9**:
    - **RelevanceScore**: 6
    - **Justification**: This evidence mentions the investigation regarding wood pulp in parmesan cheese but focuses more on consumer reactions and general claims rather than providing specific data. It confirms the claim but does so in a less impactful manner compared to others.

In summary, the scores reflect how well each piece of evidence addresses the question of whether wood pulp is used in parmesan cheeses and its relevance to validating or debunking the initial claim.

2024-08-03 14:42:45 - Thread-83 (process_claim_verification) - INFO - Yes, it is true that wood pulp is used in the production of certain Parmesan cheeses, specifically in some shredded cheese products. This wood pulp is commonly known as cellulose, which serves as an anti-caking agent to prevent clumping in grated cheeses. The FDA allows cheese products to contain up to 4% cellulose, and it is typically not harmful in those amounts [Query 2_evidence_1].

However, the controversy arises from cases where some brands have misrepresented their products as "100% Parmesan" while including significant amounts of cellulose, wood pulp, or other cheaper cheese types. A notable incident involved Castle Cheese Inc., which was found by the FDA to have doctored its Parmesan products with a mix of cheaper cheddar and cellulose, leading to legal repercussions for the company [Query 1_evidence_2].

Research has indicated that a considerable portion of grated Parmesan on the market may not contain authentic Parmesan cheese at all. One estimate suggests that around 20% of grated Parmesan could be mislabeled, with some containing over 8% cellulose, which exceeds the FDA's recommended limit [Query 2_evidence_1].

Thus, while cellulose (wood pulp) is an approved additive and can be legally present in small amounts in shredded cheese, many products labeled as Parmesan do not adhere to the standards that define true Parmesan cheese, leading to both consumer fraud and health considerations [Query 1_evidence_1][Query 1_evidence_2].

**Confidence level: 90%**. The evidence provided includes credible sources discussing FDA regulations and specific cases of mislabeling that support the claim regarding the use of wood pulp in Parmesan cheese products.

    "QA_CONTEXTS": {"Question": "Is it true that wood pulp is used in the production of certain parmesan cheeses?", "Answer": "Yes, it is true that wood pulp is used in the production of certain Parmesan cheeses, specifically in some shredded cheese products. This wood pulp is commonly known as cellulose, which serves as an anti-caking agent to prevent clumping in grated cheeses. The FDA allows cheese products to contain up to 4% cellulose, and it is typically not harmful in those amounts. However, the controversy arises from cases where some brands have misrepresented their products as '100% Parmesan' while including significant amounts of cellulose, wood pulp, or other cheaper cheese types. A notable incident involved Castle Cheese Inc., which was found by the FDA to have doctored its Parmesan products with a mix of cheaper cheddar and cellulose, leading to legal repercussions for the company. Research has indicated that a considerable portion of grated Parmesan on the market may not contain authentic Parmesan cheese at all. One estimate suggests that around 20% of grated Parmesan could be mislabeled, with some containing over 8% cellulose, which exceeds the FDA's recommended limit. Thus, while cellulose (wood pulp) is an approved additive and can be legally present in small amounts in shredded cheese, many products labeled as Parmesan do not adhere to the standards that define true Parmesan cheese, leading to both consumer fraud and health considerations.", "Confidence": "90%"},

The text notes that the FDA permits cheese products to contain up to 4% cellulose, and highlights instances where brands like Castle Cheese Inc. were found to include significant amounts of cellulose, misrepresenting their products.
