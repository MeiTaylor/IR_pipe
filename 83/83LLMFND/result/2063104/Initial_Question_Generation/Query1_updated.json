Before any words were spoken, the audience rose for a standing ovation. He is the first sitting president to ever be part of the SXSW Conference & Festivals in Austin, TX.\nPresident Obama and Evan Smith discussed a myriad of topics including **civic engagement in the 21st Century** before an audience of creators, early adopters, and entrepreneurs who are defining the future of our connected lives. During the Keynote, the President called on the SXSW audience as well as the tech industry at-large to help solve the nation\u2019s biggest problems by working in conjunction with the United States government.\n> #### \"It\u2019s not enough to focus on the cool, next big thing. It\u2019s harnessing the cool, next big thing to help people in this country.\"\nHe also reminded the audience about the campaign that he ran on in 2008 saying, \"The slogan wasn\u2019t 'Yes, _I_ can' it was 'Yes, _we_ can,'\" to encourage the attendees and live stream listeners around the country to make an impact in their communities.\nWatch the entire .

President and Mrs. Obama\u2019s visit here will inspire attendees to that purpose.\u201d\nUnfortunately, the president\u2019s speech happens on the same day as a panel near and dear to the first lady\u2019s health-conscious interests\u2014. Luckily SXSW features   panels.\nThe tech festival has become a go-to for  and . No word if the Obamas will stick around for , or if someone will disrupt the \nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser will also be in attendance.\nYou haven't listened to any stories!\nWhat's the hold up?\nWAMU stopped publishing DCist.com in February 2024. You are viewing the site archive.",

Photograph: Lizzie Chen/The Guardian\nJuliet Tango were playing in front of a waffle truck, having driven to Austin from Olympia, Washington \u2013 a distance of more than 2,000 miles. \u201cWe had a hell of a trip, we just got here this morning and rolled in on our last two dollars of gas,\u201d said drummer Ripley Ty.\nBut was it worth it?\n\u201cAbsolutely! We\u2019re going to be playing out here tonight and tomorrow night and hopefully make enough gas money to get home.\u201d\n!\nBlushhh Music is Mathew Knowles\u2019 latest band on his music label, Music World. Photograph: Lizzie Chen/The Guardian\nFurther down Sixth Street we came across three young women in tracksuits painted with their logo, Blushhh Music. They were happy to have their photograph taken, but reacted to an interview request like Dracula confronted with a crucifix. All interview requests, I was informed, go through their manager, Mathew Knowles. They are Blushhh Music \u2013 in other words, proteges of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s dad. They gave the Guardian a poster.\n!\nRapper Micky Munday from Los Angeles came down to Austin to perform during SXSW. This is his third time at the festival. Photograph: Lizzie Chen/The Guardian\nMicky Munday was one of a number of rappers hanging out on the street \u2013 the LA native was set to play three shows including the Lit Lounge and the Eastern. \u201cSouth by Southwest is dope,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful thing. When you\u2019re out here, everyone comes for new music, they come with open ears, so it\u2019s a blessing.\u201d\nSo how was he going down? \u201cWe rocking that motherfucker, man. We killing that shit. We\u2019re jumping on couches and tables, kicking over drinks on the bar, spilling drinks on women, pouring champagne on ladies \u2013 you\u2019ve got to do what you\u2019ve got to do, man. We in the moment!\u201d\n!\nBud Wilmer and Linda McGuyer drove to Austin from Houston to check out the festival. Wilmer makes his own guitars.

The Obamas are giving keynote addresses, Oscar-winning directors are premiering their movies, and brands are descending on the city to spend millions on sponsorships, swag and flashy stunts.\nIt\u2019s easy to mourn the years where SXSW put independent art and music at its forefront, before Super Bowl levels of corporate mania (and corporate money) took over. , the festival is once again reasserting its importance to art, tech and civic engagement.\n**The Obamas, getting real**: Obviously, the Obamas\u2019 keynotes bookending the festival \u2014 Barack\u2019s to open SXSW Interactive today; Michelle\u2019s to close the festivities on March 16 \u2014 are the two most noteworthy. We\u2019re looking forward to Obama\u2019s speech about tech and civic engagement, and hopefully, at a conference more known for its buzzy app launches, he can galvanize the entrepreneurs in the room to do good. But more exciting is Michelle\u2019s, where she\u2019ll discuss her Let Girls Learn initiative and girls\u2019 education. Her speech kicks off SXSW Music, coming at a time when the music industry\u2019s sexism problem is now a national conversation. So we hope we hear echoes of feminism and gender equality in Michelle\u2019s talk.\n**The...[Content truncated]",
