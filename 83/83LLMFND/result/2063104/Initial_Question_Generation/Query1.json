Before any words were spoken, the audience rose for a standing ovation. He is the first sitting president to ever be part of the SXSW Conference & Festivals in Austin, TX.\nPresident Obama and Evan Smith discussed a myriad of topics including **civic engagement in the 21st Century** before an audience of creators, early adopters, and entrepreneurs who are defining the future of our connected lives. During the Keynote, the President called on the SXSW audience as well as the tech industry at-large to help solve the nation’s biggest problems by working in conjunction with the United States government.\n> #### \"It’s not enough to focus on the cool, next big thing. It’s harnessing the cool, next big thing to help people in this country.\"\nHe also reminded the audience about the campaign that he ran on in 2008 saying, \"The slogan wasn’t 'Yes, _I_ can' it was 'Yes, _we_ can,'\" to encourage the attendees and live stream listeners around the country to make an impact in their communities.\nWatch the entire .

Photo by Mike Theiler-Pool/Getty Images.\nFor the first time since the conference launched in 1987, this year’s South By Southwest Festival will feature a sitting president and first lady.\nPresident Barack Obama will have a conversation with the editor in chief of _The Texas Tribune_ on March 11, and First Lady Michelle Obama will discuss her  on March 16.\n“I can’t imagine a better way to celebrate our event’s 30th year than to welcome both the President and First Lady to SXSW,” said festival co-founder Roland Swenson . “As each new generation comes up at SXSW they look for ways they can be of service, and it’s important to reflect and support that message. President and Mrs. Obama’s visit here will inspire attendees to that purpose.”\nUnfortunately, the president’s speech happens on the same day as a panel near and dear to the first lady’s health-conscious interests—. Luckily SXSW features   panels.\nThe tech festival has become a go-to for  and . No word if the Obamas will stick around for , or if someone will disrupt the \nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser will also be in attendance.\nYou haven't listened to any stories!\nWhat's the hold up?\nWAMU stopped publishing DCist.com in February 2024. You are viewing the site archive.",

Photograph: Lizzie Chen/The Guardian\nJuliet Tango were playing in front of a waffle truck, having driven to Austin from Olympia, Washington – a distance of more than 2,000 miles. “We had a hell of a trip, we just got here this morning and rolled in on our last two dollars of gas,” said drummer Ripley Ty.\nBut was it worth it?\n“Absolutely! We’re going to be playing out here tonight and tomorrow night and hopefully make enough gas money to get home.”\n!\nBlushhh Music is Mathew Knowles’ latest band on his music label, Music World. Photograph: Lizzie Chen/The Guardian\nFurther down Sixth Street we came across three young women in tracksuits painted with their logo, Blushhh Music. They were happy to have their photograph taken, but reacted to an interview request like Dracula confronted with a crucifix. All interview requests, I was informed, go through their manager, Mathew Knowles. They are Blushhh Music – in other words, proteges of Beyoncé’s dad. They gave the Guardian a poster.\n!\nRapper Micky Munday from Los Angeles came down to Austin to perform during SXSW. This is his third time at the festival. Photograph: Lizzie Chen/The Guardian\nMicky Munday was one of a number of rappers hanging out on the street – the LA native was set to play three shows including the Lit Lounge and the Eastern. “South by Southwest is dope,” he said. “It’s a beautiful thing. When you’re out here, everyone comes for new music, they come with open ears, so it’s a blessing.”\nSo how was he going down? “We rocking that motherfucker, man. We killing that shit. We’re jumping on couches and tables, kicking over drinks on the bar, spilling drinks on women, pouring champagne on ladies – you’ve got to do what you’ve got to do, man. We in the moment!”\n!\nBud Wilmer and Linda McGuyer drove to Austin from Houston to check out the festival. Wilmer makes his own guitars. Photograph: Lizzie Chen/The Guardian\nBud Wilmer and Linda McGuyer were “just hanging out”, having driven here from Houston.\n“We’ve got no plans, we’ll just see what happens.” Big music fans? “Who isn’t?” said Wilmer, a guitar maker. They’ve been to the festival before and like to people...[Content truncated]",

The Obamas are giving keynote addresses, Oscar-winning directors are premiering their movies, and brands are descending on the city to spend millions on sponsorships, swag and flashy stunts.\nIt’s easy to mourn the years where SXSW put independent art and music at its forefront, before Super Bowl levels of corporate mania (and corporate money) took over. , the festival is once again reasserting its importance to art, tech and civic engagement.\n**The Obamas, getting real**: Obviously, the Obamas’ keynotes bookending the festival — Barack’s to open SXSW Interactive today; Michelle’s to close the festivities on March 16 — are the two most noteworthy.

From there, I used Google Maps URLs to figure out the latitude and longitude of the new venues for the custom geocoding and the Noun Project to find a nice public domain building icon. As far as chart types, these are largely unchanged. So, what’s new besides some updated session information?\nCustom Maps: Going from “10 Minutes or Less” to “30 Seconds Tops”\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nI’ve made some visual changes this year, including changing some colors and fonts around to fit the new logo a little better.
