Recently, he also failed to attend Justice Scalia's funeral. How can Obama think that a music festival is more important than the funeral of a former first lady? Why does he think that it is okay to just skip the funeral of a member of the supreme court who died in office? His actions seem to demonstrate a complete lack of respect for conservatives in particular and America as a whole.\n    0\n    0\n    Report Post\n*   coach deez nuts\n    registered\n    Follow\n    Follow coach deez nuts\n    ----------------------\n    Block\n    Block coach deez nuts\n    ---------------------\n     and sign in to block users and avoid seeing their posts.\n    registered\n    #### coach deez nuts\n    Member since 11/24/2015.\n    527 posts.

It\u2019s a guaranteed trivia stumper. So, since I sort of did just ask the question, go ahead, take a guess. I\u2019ll wait. \u2026\nGive up?

As gay men died in droves, President Reagan refused, until late in his second term, to even speak the name of the virus that was killing them.\nSo Staley \u2014 an AIDS activist prominently featured in the Oscar-nominated documentary \u201c\u201d \u2014 was stunned last Friday when his preferred presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, praised Nancy Reagan\u2019s \u201clow-key advocacy\u201d to fight AIDS in an interview with NBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell.\n\u201cBottom line, it was a WTF moment,\u201d Staley told TheWrap. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\nMany gay voters have a soft spot for Clinton. She\u2019s appeared at countless gay events and expressed her support for LGBT causes \u2014 including in a historic 2011  before the United Nations. In April, she scored major points by featuring a same-sex couple holding hands in her , a first for any presidential candidate.\nBut her gaffe threatened to undercut Clinton\u2019s support among one of her most important bases \u2014 one that helped power President Obama to his second term.\n**Also Read:** \nSean Denoyer, an Illinois resident who\u2019s already cast his primary vote, had the same reaction as many gay voters. \u201cI was horrified,\u201d he said. \u201cIt confirmed my worst fears. I was just starting to feel a little comfortable with her but now I don\u2019t trust her anymore.\u201d\nClinton\u2019s campaign went into overdrive to make amends. Within minutes, Clinton issued a swift  on Twitter, saying she \u201cmisspoke.\u201d She followed up with a longer, more heartfelt  the following day on Medium.\n\u201cTo be clear, the Reagans did not start a national conversation about HIV and AIDS,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat distinction belongs to generations of brave lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, along with straight allies, who started not just a conversation but a movement that continues to this day.\u201d\nBut some say the damage was already done.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me she \u2018misspoke,'\u201d said Jon Cooper, a longtime fundraiser for Obama/Biden. \u201cI\u2019m not buying. Hillary is an intelligent person. She had to be aware of the biggest stain of Reagan\u2019s presidency.\u201d\nCooper, who was part of the Draft Biden Super PAC last year, says he was considering fundraising for either Sanders or Clinton after Biden announced he wasn\u2019t running. But Clinton\u2019s comments have pushed him further toward Sanders.\n**Also Read:** \nMoreover, he said some of his donor friends were so spooked by Clinton\u2019s remarks that...[Content truncated]",
