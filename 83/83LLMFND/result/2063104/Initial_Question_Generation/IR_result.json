        "Question": "Did President Obama actually skip Nancy Reagan's funeral to attend South by Southwest?",
        "Answer": "Yes, President Obama did skip Nancy Reagan's funeral to attend the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival. The evidence indicates that he was scheduled to deliver a keynote speech at SXSW on the same day as the funeral, which was set for March 11, 2016. The decision attracted some criticism, as many observers noted the timing of his appearance at SXSW, contrasting it with the funeral of the former first lady. Michelle Obama did attend the funeral to represent her husband. This reinforces the fact that while the president had a commitment to speak at an important event, it meant he would not be present at a significant occasion for a former first lady, which some people viewed as questionable prioritization. In summary, based on the evidence, President Obama indeed chose to attend SXSW instead of Nancy Reagan's funeral.",
