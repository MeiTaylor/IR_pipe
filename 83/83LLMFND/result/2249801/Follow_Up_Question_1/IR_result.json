        "Question": "What evidence exists of Angelina Jordan's performances at age eight compared to Amy Winehouse's singing at age ten?",
        "Answer": "Angelina Jordan's performances at age eight are well-documented, particularly highlighted by her winning audition on \"Norway's Got Talent\" in 2014, where she showcased her exceptional vocal abilities by singing \"What a Difference a Day Makes.\" This performance took place on July 3, 2014, when she was celebrated for captivating the audience with her talent at a young age. Additionally, her biography notes that she was born on January 10, 2006, which places her performance achievements firmly at the age of eight during this period. In contrast, Amy Winehouse did not have publicly available performances at the age of ten. The earliest known footage of Winehouse singing comes from when she was 14 years old, during a friend's birthday party, where she performed \"Happy Birthday.\" This indicates that there is no evidence of her performing in front of an audience at the age of ten or capturing the same level of public attention or acclaim as seen with Angelina Jordan. Thus, we can conclude that there is substantial evidence of Angelina Jordan's talent displayed at age eight through various performances, while there is a lack of evidence for any significant performances by Amy Winehouse until she was older. This comparison illustrates a clear distinction in the visibility and recognition of their talents at those respective ages.",
