She appears to be stoned or drunk. And her boyfriend seems to be pushing the behavior a bit. Nonetheless it's quite gross. As an Amy fan, I don't know what to do about it. I don't necessarily feel guilty for listening to her music, because nothing is going to her... I think I will forever be a fan of her music. But her past behavior makes it hard to still think she was an amazing person. I really want to know what y'all think, because as much as i love Amy, I can't act like she was perfect.\nRead more\nAdd a Comment\nSort by:\nBest\nOpen comment sort options\n*   Best\n    *   Top\n    *   New\n    *   Controversial\n    *   Old\n    *   Q&A\n• \nSorry you have to grapple with that. I remember feeling embarrassed for her when it came out.\nThe way I approach this is that I see this in the context its in. It seems she's singing a song that is supposed to be fun, and probably sang at a pub, but is just filled with offensive buzzwords. The thing is, she's not singing it with conviction - the idea that Amy hated any of these groups is just absurd. I think her actions show she was a very tolerant person with people of all different persuasions in her friendship groups.\nI'm gay, and thing is, some of Amys lyrics seem homophobic - Stronger than Me equ...[Content truncated]",
