She appears to be stoned or drunk. And her boyfriend seems to be pushing the behavior a bit. Nonetheless it's quite gross. As an Amy fan, I don't know what to do about it. I don't necessarily feel guilty for listening to her music, because nothing is going to her... I think I will forever be a fan of her music. But her past behavior makes it hard to still think she was an amazing person. I really want to know what y'all think, because as much as i love Amy, I can't act like she was perfect.\nRead more\nAdd a Comment\nSort by:\nBest\nOpen comment sort options\n*   Best\n    *   Top\n    *   New\n    *   Controversial\n    *   Old\n    *   Q&A\n• \nSorry you have to grapple with that. I remember feeling embarrassed for her when it came out.\nThe way I approach this is that I see this in the context its in. It seems she's singing a song that is supposed to be fun, and probably sang at a pub, but is just filled with offensive buzzwords. The thing is, she's not singing it with conviction - the idea that Amy hated any of these groups is just absurd. I think her actions show she was a very tolerant person with people of all different persuasions in her friendship groups.\nI'm gay, and thing is, some of Amys lyrics seem homophobic - Stronger than Me equ...[Content truncated]",

The two girls only rehearsed, never performed.\nAt age nine Amy began taking occasional classes at the , gaining her first formal training in singing and dancing. At age twelve, she won a scholarship to the  in London, and her audition even got written up in _The Stage_. It’s all too fitting that her audition song was  “On the Sunny Side of the Street”—a jazz standard popular with African-American singers who crossed over to popular acclaim, but composed more than a half century  before Winehouse was born.\nHer application to the school includes an essay where she spelled out her goals:\n> I want to go somewhere where I am stretched right to my limits and perhaps even beyond.\n> \n> To sing in lessons without being told to shut up (provided they are singing lessons).\n> \n> But mostly I have this dream to be very famous.\nShe wasn’t even a teenager yet, but she already knew what she wanted—and was aiming as high as she could dream. And her dreams were sky high.\nI sometimes wonder if she would still be alive if she hadn’t been quite so famous. Maybe even a less lucrative career as a jazz singer would have been a better decision, at least for fans like me, and for Winehouse’s own survival.\nWho knows? But I do wonder what she could have done if she had been able to record with the best jazz musicians in the world. And it might have happened. Her relationship with Tony Bennett would have opened doors for her. Not doors to fame and fortune—those were already at her beck and call. But imagine Winehouse collaborating with the Maria Schneider Orchestra (as David Bowie did shortly before his death), or working with Kamasi Washington (as Kendrick Lamar has done), or making music with Fred Hersch (as have Renée Fleming, Audra McDonald, and other crossover vocalists).\nCall me crazy, but I can picture her sitting in with Paul Motian’s band or The Bad Plus at the Village Vanguard. I can envision her doing duets with Gregory Porter or Esperanza Spalding. In my mind, I can see her singing in the cacophonous midst of Sons of Kemet, or going into the studio with Flying Lotus, or hiring Jacob Collier to produce her next record.\nThose things will never happen, but make no mistake. Amy could have handled every one of those situations, and not only would have risen to the occasion, but revealed new aspects of...[Content truncated]",

I really like what she’s doing at the minute with the whole jazz and soul vibe she’s got going on. The best way to describe her music is like a mix between Tracy Chapman and Amy Winehouse in my opinion; she brings a lot of world issues to light in her songs like Tracy did, along with being common as muck and a great vocalist/lyricist like Amy.\nHowever, when people say “She’s the next Amy Winehouse” or “She’s Amy Winehouse reincarnated” it bugs me because to be fair, I don’t see much of a resemblance. Maybe the nose a little but that’s it. Anyway, the whole point of me writing this post is because of Raye’s new music video. I think the song is marvellous, it’s very different to what’s in the charts these days. The video is great too, but there seem to be undoubtedly a few references to Amy throughout so i’m quite curious if this is Raye’s method of embracing the comparisons she gets. She did say in an interview with Capital (Or maybe Heart) that she didn’t feel capable of living up to the comparisons since Amy is a legend.\nJust curious about everyone’s thoughts! Let me know what you think.\nRead more\n*   !\n    !\n*   !\n    !\n*   !\n    !\n*   !\n    !\n*   !\n    !\n*   !\n    !\n*   !\n    !\n*   !\n    !\n**Top 6%** \n*   &nbsp;\n*   &nbsp;\n* * *\n*   TOPICS\n*   Internet Culture (V...[Content truncated]",

She is wearing a simply black tank top.\nDan Kitwood/Getty Images\nDirected by **Asif Kapadia**, _Amy_ is an in-depth and, at times a devastating, look at the singer's life, which was tragically cut short at age 27 on July 23, 2011 when she died of accidental alcohol poisoning.\nShe was not only a drug addict, but Winehouse also suffered from bulimia.\n\"I honestly think 50 things killed her,\" Kapadia recently told me. \"It's no simple thing. It's everything. It's her situation at home. It's her family, her relationships, it's her boyfriend, it's no self-esteem…not feeling enough love to love herself and to care about herself. Everything.\n\"And then on top of that, you get too much money, too much success,\" he continued. \"Nobody says no…Everything created a situation of this mess around her. Nobody stopped it. It went on and on and on. It got out of control. And when they did try to stop it, it was too late.\"\n_Amy_ is in theaters in L.A. and NYC on July 3 followed by a nationwide release on July 10.",

Her brother is one of the trumpet players. She wants to play a talent show but needed a video to submit so my brother recruited some people including me for this recording. I was very happy to be part of this project as it was my first time being in a \"real\" studio.  \nI only had one rehearsal with the band going in and only had two hours to record three songs. ( The third video will be released later)\nI was very nervous and only started feeling relaxed at the end. But then it was time to go.\nA few things I am obsessing over:  \nMy time fluctuations.  \nI wish I could have came up with better drum parts.  \nAnd the side view that shows my gut.\nLet me know what you think.\nLast edited: Mar 17, 2014\n*   \n*   \nTo be completely honest, I liked the vibe of the song but I didn't really like the singing - the thing that this is all about. I don't know why, but she seems nervous so maybe that has something to do with it.\nI always like songs like these because they are so joyful. I think you did a good job with the drumming!

The musician, who gave us songs like “I Left My Heart in San Francisco,” came from an Italian immigrant family, but many Jewish stars inspired him and collaborated with him, from Irving Berlin, for whom he recorded a whole tribute album, to Billy Joel, whom he joined in a couple of concerts.\nYet Bennett’s most famous and touching collaboration with a Jewish star was without a doubt his 2011 duet with singer Amy Winehouse — one of the last recordings of the groundbreaking Jewish singer before her untimely death, which was featured on his album “Duets II: The Greatest Hits.”\nIn March of 2011, Bennett flew to London to record a cover of “Body and Soul” with Winehouse, who had been absent from the recording studio for a while. For an entire day, they worked on this sweeping, enchanting and truly unique rendition of the 1930 Jazz standard written by Edward Heymann and composed by Johnny Green.\nWinehouse passed away before the song was ever released to the public, in July of 2011, at age 27. The single ended up being released on what would’ve been her 28th birthday. When it charted on the Billboard Hot 100...[Content truncated]",
