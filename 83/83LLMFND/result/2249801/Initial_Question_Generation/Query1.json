I think her actions show she was a very tolerant person with people of all different persuasions in her friendship groups.\nI'm gay, and thing is, some of Amys lyrics seem homophobic - Stronger than Me equ...[Content truncated]",

But it never actually looks beneath the surface. Charting the charismatic songwriter’s rise from scrappy working-class London beginnings to international superstardom, the film is rarely anything more than a thinly drawn approximation of her life.\nWe’ve got Amy Winehouse (Marisa Abela) aggressively yelling about how much she loves jazz and breaking into song at family gatherings. We’ve got her lover, Blake Fielder-Civil (Jack O’Connell), being a cheeky chappy, betting on horses and drinking pints in the pub. Then of course there’s Amy’s dad, Mitch Winehouse (Eddie Marsan), being a salt-of-the-earth supporter of his daughter who occasionally drops some Cockney rhyming slang into a sentence, lest we forget where he’s from.\nSponsored\nThe actors do the absolute most with the material at hand — kudos to the entire cast — but a self-conscious script holds them back at every turn. There’s just not enough meat to work with.\nPart of the problem is that the Amy and Blake we see here...[Content truncated]",

Just when you thought we might be done exploiting Amy Winehouse’s tragic end for profit, it turns out … there’s still some cash to be made! This morning, a new trailer emerged for _Back to Black_, a biopic that aims to capture Winehouse’s rise to stardom and ultimate spiral into self-destruction, all for our sick enjoyment. Hurray!\nBefore I say anything else, please now look at the trailer. And be sure to pay particular attention to the supremely ironic part where the actress playing Winehouse (Marisa Abela) mutters the line, “I wanna be remembered for just being me.” _Ugh._\nPlease now allow me to now tell you all of the reasons I already hate this movie.\n1.  Amy Winehouse was goofy and hilarious and had a bawdy sense of humor and there is no sign of any of that in this trailer and that is a giant bummer.\n2.  The Winehouse estate approved _Back to Black_, but the Winehouse estate has demonstrated over and over again that  from Amy Winehouse’s name, regardless of whether or not she’d have approved. These people , for crying out loud. Can we be done giving them money now?\n3.  Marisa Abela is doing an extremely good Amy Winehouse impersonation here. It’s genuinely impressive. Unfortunately, all of the things that made Winehouse such a compelling performer and human were perfectly intangible and cannot be replicated. By anyone. Even someone who’s nailing the accent this well. No amount of hairspray and eyeliner is going to compensate for that.\n4.  That “You’ve gotta remember: I ain’t no Spice Girl” line was deemed enough of a movie high-point to be put in this trailer. Let’s consider how bad...[Content truncated]",
