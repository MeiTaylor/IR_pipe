In other footage Winehouse grabs a mic in front of her live band and sings, “Like two ships passing in the night/ In the night, in the night/ Want the same thing where we lay/ Otherwise mine’s a different way.”\nThe video refresh — the original was directed by Paul Gore — comes as _Frank_ has been reissued in a limited-edition 2LP . The LP features the singles “Take The Box,” “Stronger Than Me,” F–k Me Pumps” and “In My Bed,” and has the original sleeve imagery, plus additional images by Valerie Phillips from the original album photoshoot.\n### Trending on Billboard\nWinehouse died on July 23, 2011 at age 27 of an accidental alcohol overdose after years of substance use struggles.

        "Question": "Is the girl in the video actually Amy Winehouse, and is she ten years old?",
        "Answer": "The girl in the video is not Amy Winehouse, and she is not ten years old. The video features a young girl named Angelina Jordan, who is eight years old at the time of the performance, singing \"What a Difference a Day Makes\" on a stage in an outdoor event, which is quite different from Amy Winehouse's performances at a similar age. Furthermore, evidence shows that Amy Winehouse was recorded singing at the age of 14, and there is no footage or record of her singing at 10 years old, which further supports that the girl in the video is not her. Specifically, two articles detail home video footage of Winehouse singing \"Happy Birthday\" at a friend's birthday party when she was 14, showcasing her talent at that age, indicating she was older than 10 at the time of her recorded singing. Thus, it is clear that the girl in the video is Angelina Jordan and is not Amy Winehouse, who did not perform publicly at the age of 10.",
