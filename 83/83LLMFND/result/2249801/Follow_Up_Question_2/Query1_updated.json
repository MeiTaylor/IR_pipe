Today, it is in the realm of music. I came across this amazing singer a few weeks ago and wanted to share the talent discovery. She is just 14, I believe, but started singling at 18 months! She can sing anything, except perhaps Metal! I think she has the best young female voice I have ever heard. (All ages are approximate and approximately accurate!) (And it makes a nice change from talking about politics all the time!)\nSo, sit back, relax, turn the volume up and enjoy the adventure...\nLet's start her off singing at age 8!!\nHere is her at age 10!\nAgain, aged 10:\nAged 10 with full backing orchestra:\nAged 12ish: (Born to Die - love this song)\nFor Adele lovers, aged 13:\nFor Whitney Houston belting type songs, aged 13:\nAge 13 or just 14 on America's Got Talent:\nLet me know what you think. Hopefully it puts a smile on some faces.\nLast edited: Jun 7, 2020\n*   \n*   \nI remember her, what a voice. I also love...\n]\n*   \n*   \nI remember her and she really is talented! I could not believe what I was watching when I saw it.\n*   \n*   \nI also listen to Charlotte Summers over and over.\n]\n*   \n*   \nI'm beginning to think that Jon has got access to my browser history! Yet again last night I was on a similar wavelength, or should I say channeling!\nThis looks like her most recent appearance on America...[Content truncated]",
