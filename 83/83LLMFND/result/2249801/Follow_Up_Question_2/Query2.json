She also formed a working relationship with producer Salaam Remi through these record publishers. Winehouse's debut album, Frank, was released in 2003. Many of the album's songs were influenced by jazz and, apart from two covers, were co-written by Winehouse. Frank was a critical success in the UK and was nominated for the Mercury Prize. The song \"Stronger Than Me\" won her the Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.\nWinehouse released her follow-up album, Back to Black, in 2006. The album went on to become a huge international success and one of the best-selling albums...[Content truncated]",

But the spotlight was unnecessarily cruel to someone so young.\nThe discography she left behind is pitifully thin: two studio albums (w/extras) plus one posthumous. Obviously the latter can be discounted: have any of those scrapped together post-tragedy albums ever been good? _Frank_ is trickier to dismiss, but it's still more \"interesting\" than accomplished. \"You Sent Me Flying\" and \"Fuck Me Pumps\" are two gems buried amongst the clutter, but on the whole _Frank_ is directionless and occasionally quite nasty.\nAnd then there's _Back to Black_: a masterpiece that ranks amongst the greatest albums of the 2000s.\nThe most obvious and vital change since _Frank_ is the arrival of Mark Ronson as a producer. He described Winehouse as his \"musical soulmate\" after her death, and it's hard to dispute: _Back to Black_ is by far the finest project either artist has worked on. Him having found her sound in a fresh and organic take on contemporary R&B (and Salaam Remi having followed suit), Amy was now able to come into herself as an artist.\nHer secret was the same as Kurt Cobain's and Dusty Springfield's: she felt emotion so deeply that they bled into the music. \"Rehab\" paints a portrait of a woman who feels heartbreak so intensely that she has to numb it with drink. \"You Know That I'm No Good\" is punctuated by the complex guilt and self-loathing of the cheater. All the love songs here feel _real_, as if Amy had been through a break-up on the same day that she was off to the studio. The apex comes with the one-two knock out of the title track and \"Love is a Losing Game\". The former sounds as much 1959 as it does 2006. The latter sounds eternal.\nFifteen years later, and two songs could trick you into thinking that Amy was going to be alright in the end: the cathartic \"Tears Dry on Their Own\" (\"I should just be my own best friend/Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men\") and the jubilant \"Addicted\" (better to get high than drink yourself to death). They make me wonder what she could have achieved if she'd been given the time to mature: she definitely sounds like a woman with at least a...[Content truncated]",

Afterward, Winehouse canceled all concerts and public appearances for the rest of the year, again citing “doctor’s orders.” That December, Winehouse was arrested again on suspicion of attempting to interfere with her husband’s bribery case. She voluntarily reported to a police station and was arrested before questioning.\nIn January 2008, a video allegedly showing Winehouse smoking crack cocaine surfaced, leading to a brief stint in a London rehab clinic. She was arrested that May for questioning but wasn’t formally charged in the case after police said they couldn’t officially determine what the singer was smoking.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nAfter a June 2008 concert where she was caught on video throwing punches into the crowd, Winehouse returned to a London clinic, where she had been receiving treatment for “traces of emphysema” and an irregular heartbeat caused by smoking crack cocaine and cigarettes. Winehouse’s father told reporters that his daughter was warned that she would have to wear an oxygen mask if she didn’t stop abusing drugs.\n!\nGetty Images\nAmy Winehouse leaves home with her father, Mitch Winehouse (left), for a March 2009 court appearance.\nThe singer soon found herself in more legal trouble when a burlesque dancer named Serene Flash accused Winehouse of hitting her in the eye at a London charity event in September 2008. Winehouse testified in court she did push Flash away but only after feeling intimidated when Flash asked her for a photo and attempted to embrace her. “I think she was being overly friendly but that was intimidating. I was scared. I’m not Mickey Mouse, I’m a human being,” Winehouse . In July 2009, a district judge dismissed the case.\nLast Performance, Death, and Funeral\n------------------------------------\nWinehouse gave her final concert performance on June 18, 2011, serving as an opening act for DJ and singer-songwriter Moby at the Tuborg Festival in Belgrade, Serbia. Winehouse slurred her words and uncomfortably swayed back and forth throughout the set, receiving a cascade of boos from the 20,000 fans in attendance. The singer, who had recently ended a stint in rehab, was rushed back to her hotel, while  to fulfill their time obligation.\nOnly weeks later on July 23, 2011, Winehouse was found unresponsive in the bedroom of her home in Camden, London, and pronounced dead at age 27. Authorities determined the cause of death was accidental alcohol poisoning.\nAdvertisement -...[Content truncated]",

After stepping into the gloom of the byzantine manor and being welcomed by the narrator’s fiendish baritone, we were ushered into little cars that shuffled us through a series of spooky tableaus. Soon, below us — so that we had to peer down — a lively ballroom scene appeared. There was a long banquet table with spectral diners, and dancers waltzing in ghoulish glory. You could see them, but you could also see through them. The last image you encountered in the room was an organist. He was caped and similarly transparent — bluish — and pumping upward from the organ pipes were tiny skulls. The organist was in studious concentration. He was there to play.\nBefore the trip was over, in a gift shop I gravitated toward a postcard rack, and there among the offerings I picked out one of the organist. On the long drive back — and for many months afterward — I kept studying it. I was too young to wonder how the technicians at Disney had pulled off this effect but old enough not to believe what I saw. I just happened to be fascinated with the very notion of death not keeping a musician from performing.\nForty-seven years later, I began to hear about concerts that made me think of that organist again: tours featuring Roy Orbison, Frank Zappa, Amy Winehouse, classical pianist Glenn Gould, Maria Callas, Buddy Holly, Whitney Houston and heavy metal belter Ronnie James Dio. All of the performers had one defining commonality: They were dead. And yet they were all back on the tour circuit, or would be soon, in hologram form, thanks to a new crop of companies that were putting Hollywood-style digital re-creations of famous musicians onstage.\nAt some point, I told my youngest son, Anderson, that I was going to be writing about the surge of music holograms — and, as would be the case for so many people I mentioned this story to over the months I spent reporting it, I had to explain what this was and that, yes, it was actually happening. Anderson, who had recently become obsessed with ’60s psychedelia artists like Jefferson Airplane and the 13th Floor Elevators, was aghast.\n“That’s bulls---!” he said. He insisted that the whole enterprise was disgusting and amoral, and in a hot flash he was stomping his way up to his bedroom. As it was for me — at 18 but also now — music...[Content truncated]",

But it's her small but powerful body of recorded music that will be her legacy.\nThe singer was found dead Saturday at age 27 by ambulance crews called to her home in north London's Camden area, a youth-culture mecca known for its music scene, its pubs -- and the availability of illegal drugs.\nThe London Ambulance Service said Winehouse had died before crews arrived at the house in leafy Camden Square. The cause of death was not immediately known.\nThe singer's body was taken from her home by private ambulance to a London mortuary where post-mortem examinations were to be carried out either Sunday or Monday...[Content truncated]",

I finally got to see it last week, and I left the theater with a profound feeling of disgust . . . at myself and my culture.\n_Amy_ tells the story of the British jazz singer Amy Winehouse through archival footage and voice-over interviews with friends and family. Winehouse’s words and songs are used to reveal and critique the forces behind her meteoric rise and tragic downfall. The film is unapologetic and brutal, casting blame for Amy’s fate towards celebrity worship, Winehouse’s standoffish family (especially her father), and Winehouse herself. It focuses largely on the latter part of Amy’s life as a professional singer, including her ascent from unknown vocalist to Grammy-winning superstar. Along the way, it evaluates complex concepts like drug addiction, adolescent naiveté, and the destructive nature of our parasitic celebrity worship culture.\nThe film opens with home video footage of a teenage Amy Winehouse singing, “Happy Birthday” with her iconic jazzy voice. Bereft of fame, she sings for silliness and joy with an unmistakable talent despite the simplicity of the song. This same sense of life accompanies Amy throughout her early career, as she breaks into the world of professional jazz singing. Radio and television interviews with...[Content truncated]",
