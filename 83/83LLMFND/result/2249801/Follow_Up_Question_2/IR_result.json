Afterward, Winehouse canceled all concerts and public appearances for the rest of the year, again citing ‚Äúdoctor‚Äôs orders.‚Äù That December, Winehouse was arrested again on suspicion of attempting to interfere with her husband‚Äôs bribery case. She voluntarily reported to a police station and was arrested before questioning.\nIn January 2008, a video allegedly showing Winehouse smoking crack cocaine surfaced, leading to a brief stint in a London rehab clinic. She was arrested that May for questioning but wasn‚Äôt formally charged in the case after police said they couldn‚Äôt officially determine what the singer was smoking.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nAfter a June 2008 concert where she was caught on video throwing punches into the crowd, Winehouse returned to a London clinic, where she had been receiving treatment for ‚Äútraces of emphysema‚Äù and an irregular heartbeat caused by smoking crack cocaine and cigarettes. Winehouse‚Äôs father told reporters that his daughter was warned that she would have to wear an oxygen mask if she didn‚Äôt stop abusing drugs.\n!\nGetty Images\nAmy Winehouse leaves home with her father, Mitch Winehouse (left), for a March 2009 court appearance.\nThe singer soon found herself in more legal trouble when a burlesque dancer named Serene Flash accused Winehouse of hitting her in the eye at a London charity event in September 2008. Winehouse testified in court she did push Flash away but only after feeling intimidated when Flash asked her for a photo and attempted to embrace her. ‚ÄúI think she was being overly friendly but that was intimidating. I was scared. I‚Äôm not Mickey Mouse, I‚Äôm a human being,‚Äù Winehouse . In July 2009, a district judge dismissed the case.\nLast Performance, Death, and Funeral\n------------------------------------\nWinehouse gave her final concert performance on June 18, 2011, serving as an opening act for DJ and singer-songwriter Moby at the Tuborg Festival in Belgrade, Serbia. Winehouse slurred her words and uncomfortably swayed back and forth throughout the set, receiving a cascade of boos from the 20,000 fans in attendance. The singer, who had recently ended a stint in rehab, was rushed back to her hotel, while  to fulfill their time obligation.\nOnly weeks later on July 23, 2011, Winehouse was found unresponsive in the bedroom of her home in Camden, London, and pronounced dead at age 27. Authorities determined the cause of death was accidental alcohol poisoning.\nAdvertisement -...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What specific details about Angelina Jordan's performance confirm her age and identity compared to Amy Winehouse's early years?",
        "Answer": "Angelina Jordan's performance provides specific details that confirm her age and identity distinct from Amy Winehouse's early years:\n\n1. **Age Confirmation through Performance Events**: Angelina Jordan's audition for the 2014 season of \"Norway's Got Talent\" took place when she was seven years old, and she won at the age of eight by performing \"What a Difference a Day Makes.\" This performance date, as reported, explicitly states her birth year as 2006, thus confirming her age during the event [Query 1_evidence 1].\n\n2. **Professional Recording Evidence**: The earliest documented performances of Angelina Jordan showcase her exceptional vocal talent at a young age. For example, her notable performances, including appearances on popular television shows like \"The View,\" occurred prominently when she was eight years old, establishing her as a recognized talent in front of a wide audience [Query 1_evidence 2]. This contrasts with Amy Winehouse, who did not appear in public performances until she was 14 years old, as no significant recordings or performances from her 10-year-old years exist; the earliest footage features her at age 14 singing \"Happy Birthday\" at a friend's birthday party [Query 2_evidence 1].\n\n3. **Lack of Early Public Performances by Amy Winehouse**: Amy Winehouse was not publicly performing or recognized as a singer at age ten. The only footage of her singing comes from a later stage of her life, reinforcing that she had not developed a public persona as a child artist comparable to Angelina, who was performing impactful pieces at a much younger age [Query 2_evidence 1].\n\nOverall, these detailed comparisons clearly illustrate how Angelina Jordan's performances not only confirm her age but also outline a stark contrast to Amy Winehouse's early developmental years in music, as evidenced by their respective timelines and public engagements.",
