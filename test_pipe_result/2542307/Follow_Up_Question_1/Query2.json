Sibrel’s bete noir is disproving that the moon landing ever happened, and while there’s overwhelming evidence that mankind made the leap in 1969, he’s not alone — moon landing conspiracy theories having been percolating since the mid-1970s. So how is this dedicated group handling the release of the Ryan Gosling-starring First Man, which triumphantly cements the story of the Apollo 11 mission in Oscar-ready packaging? The short answer is: not well.\nThe “moon landing hoax” theory posits that the United States, desperate to score a propaganda victory over the Soviet Union in the Space Race, set up a film studio and created bogus footage of Armstrong and Aldrin taking that giant leap for mankind. It’s a surprisingly pervasive belief, despite even the Mythbusters devoting time to debunking the conspiracy, with polls indicating as many as 20 percent of Americans doubt that man ever walked on the moon.\nIn 1976, technical writer Bill Kaysing published We Never Went To The Moon: America’s Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle, a seminal text for the moon landing hoax movement. Just five years after the Apollo 11 mission, Kaysing — who worked at the rocket engine company...[Content truncated]",

But there's still a lot to learn about the moon, and some \"facts\" people like to toss around are, well, wrong.\nHere are a few common myths about the moon:\n1\\. The moon has a ‘dark side’\n------------------------------\nSorry, . The side of the moon we can’t see has daytime, too. It’s more accurate to think of it as the “far side” of the moon.\nThe moon is tidally locked with the Earth, meaning it revolves around us and its own axis at the same rate. Because of this, we only ever get to see one side of the moon. In fact, no person had ever glimpsed the moon’s far side until 1959 when the Soviet spacecraft Luna 3 snapped the very first photo.\n!\n2\\. The moon causes ‘lunacy’\n----------------------------\nEver hear \"crazy things happen because it's a full moon?\"\nIt has been said that, because the moon influences the ocean tides on Earth, it can also raise and lower emotional \"tides\" in human beings. That, according to this myth, makes folks behave strangely, and is the reason for the recorded uptick in crime on full-moon nights.\nAs fun as it is to think we’re all part werewolf, the reality is the full moon just provides more light for criminal activity.\n**More:**\n3\\. A ‘blue moon’ is blue in color\n----------------------------------\nWhile certain atmospheric and cosmic occurrences can make the moon appear to change...[Content truncated]",

The Moon makes Earth a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. It also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years.\nThe Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth several billion years ago.\nEarth's only natural satellite is simply called \"the Moon\" because people didn't know other moons existed until Galileo Galilei discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610.

Can someone tell me or link me values and numbers on atmospheric conditions of both earth and moon, how much drag it produces, and how much fuel is needed to overcome gravity in both bodies and other details that I can use to tell him how that is a inaccurate estimate? Thanks.\nEdit: people considering my dad as a degenerate in the comments wasn’t too fun. The reason why I posted for help in the first place is because he is not the usual American conspiracy theorist fully denouncing the moon landings. If he was that kind of person as you guys have mentioned i would have just moved on. He is a relatively smart man busy with running a business. I know for a certainty that his opinion can be changed if the proper values and numbers are given. Please stop insulting my father.\nRead more\nArchived post.

Anything that accidentally or intentionally mangles the basic principles of astronomy. And who is on the lookout for good examples of Bad Astronomy? The Bad Astronomer, of course, a/k/a professional astronomer Phil Plait. In Bad Astronomy, Plait clears up misconceptions and malarkey relating to our Earth, moon, and the wider Universe. Ranging from commonly misunderstood notions such as why the sky is blue and the reason we have seasons, to large-scale shenanigans such as the so-called moon landing hoax and UFO sightings, Bad Astronomy wipes the stardust from readers' eyes to reveal just how the Universe works. Not only does Plait clearly explain the principles behind major concepts like the Big Bang, he leads readers to understand basics such as what makes the Moon look big when it rises and why the planets -- and astrology-- cannot directly influence our lives. Here is a fascinating and enlightening read for amateurs and experts alike. Bad Astronomy is the first volume in Wiley's \"Bad Science\" series; forthcoming titles will look at common misconceptions related to biology, weather, and the Earth.\nCopyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.\n\"The author sharply and convincingly dismisses astrology, creationism, and UFO sightings.... Plait succeeds brilliantly because his clear and understandable explanations are convincing and honest.\" -- Library Journal, March 15, 2002Inspired by his popular web site, www. badastronomy.com, this first book by Plait (astronomy, Sonoma State Univ.) debunks popular myths and misconceptions relating to astronomy and promotes science as a means of explaining our mysterious heavens. The work describes 24 common astronomical fallacies, including the beliefs that the Coriolis effect determines the direction that water drains in a bathtub and that planetary alignments can cause...[Content truncated]",
