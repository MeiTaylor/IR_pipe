Recommendations drive a significant amount of the overall viewership on YouTube, even more than channel subscriptions or search. I\u2019ve spent over a decade at YouTube building our recommendation system and I\u2019m proud to see how it\u2019s become an integral part of everyone\u2019s YouTube experience. But all too often, recommendations are seen as a mysterious black box. We want these systems to be publicly understood, so let me explain how they work, how they\u2019ve evolved, and why we\u2019ve made delivering responsible recommendations our top priority.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Recommendations on homepage.\nOur recommendation system is built on the simple principle of helping people find the videos they want to watch and that will give them value. You can find recommendations at work in two main places: your homepage and the \u201cUp Next\u201d panel. Your homepage is what you see when you first open YouTube\u2014it displays a mixture of personalized recommendations, subscriptions, and the latest news and information. The Up Next panel appears when you\u2019re watching a video and suggests additional content based on what you\u2019re currently watching, alongside other videos that we think you may be interested in.\nBack in 2008, when we first started building our recommendation system, the experience was entirely different. Let\u2019s say you mostly watch cooking videos. Wouldn\u2019t it be frustrating if your homepage only recommended the latest sports and music videos to you because they had the most views? That was YouTube in the early days. The system ranked videos based on popularity to create one big \u201cTrending\u201d page. Not a lot of people watched those videos and the majority of YouTube\u2019s viewership came from searches or shared links off the platform.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Recommendations on \"Up next.\"\nTo do this, we start with the knowledge that everyone has unique viewing habits. Our system then compares your viewing habits with those that are similar to you and uses that information to suggest other content you may want to watch. So if you like tennis videos and our system notices that others who like the same tennis videos as you also enjoy jazz videos, you may be recommended jazz videos,\u00a0even if you\u2019ve never watched a single one before\u00a0(for categories like news and information, this might function differently - more on that later). A few years ago, our system recommended videos from\u00a0Tyler Oakley\u00a0to my oldest daughter, because that\u2019s who many of the people who watched Vlogbrothers also watched at the time. She ended up becoming a big fan...[Content truncated]",

Instructors should ensure that students interact only within groups and no cross-talking occurs between groups.\nAfter revealing the correct answers and allowing teams to calculate their scores, record the team score and the lowest individual score from each team. Subtract the team score from the individual score; this provides the \u201csynergy\u201d score. Ask the students in the teams with negative synergy scores why they think their team performed as it did. Then ask the teams with positive synergy scores why they think their teams performed well. Listen for evidence of good collaboration in the teams with positive synergy.\n### NASA Exercise Handout\nYou are a member of a space crew originally scheduled to rendezvous with a mother ship on the lighted surface of the moon. Due to mechanical difficulties, however, your ship was forced to land at a spot some 200 miles from the rendezvous point. During the crash landing, much of the equipment aboard was damaged and, since survival depends on reaching the mother ship, the most critical items available must be chosen for the trip. Below are listed the 15 items left intact and undamaged after landing. Your task is to rank them in terms of their importance in allowing your crew to reach the rendezvous point.\n**Step 1**: Without communicating with team members, rank each item in order of importance. Place the number 1 by the most important item, the number 2 by the second-most important, and so on through number 15, the least important. Record these in the column labelled \u201cStep 1.\u201d\n**Step 2:** Now, as a team, reconsider the items and come up with a new set of rankings. Record these in the column labelled \u201cStep 2.\u201d\n<table width=\"636\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"215\"><strong>Items</strong></td><td width=\"85\"><strong>Step 1 Your Ranking</strong></td><td width=\"84\"><strong>Step 2 Team Ranking</strong></td><td width=\"84\"><strong>Step 3 Expert\u2019s Ranking</strong></td><td width=\"84\"><strong>Step 4 Difference* between Step 1&amp;3</strong></td><td width=\"84\"><strong>Step 5 Difference* between Step 2&amp;3</strong></td></tr><tr><td width=\"215\">Box of matches</td><td width=\"85\"></td><td width=\"84\"></td><td width=\"84\"></td><td width=\"...[Content truncated]",
