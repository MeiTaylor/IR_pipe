Conspiracy theories about the event dating back to the 1970s are in fact more popular than ever. A common theory is that film director Stanley Kubrick helped NASA fake the historic footage of its six successful moon landings.\nBut would it really have been possible to do that with the technology available at the time?\nI’m not a space travel expert, an engineer or a scientist. I am a filmmaker and lecturer in film post-production, and – while I can’t say how we landed on the moon in 1969 – I can say with some certainty that the footage would have been impossible to fake.\nHere are some of the most common beliefs and questions – and why they don’t hold up.\n### Claim 1: ‘The moon landings were filmed in a TV studio.’\nThere are  of capturing moving images. One is film, actual strips of photographic material onto which a series of images are exposed. Another is video, which is an electronic method of recording onto various mediums, such as moving magnetic tape. With video, you can also broadcast to a television receiver. A standard motion picture film records images at 24 frames per second, while broadcast television is typically either 25 or 30 frames, depending on...[Content truncated]",

That created an embarrassment of riches. How in the world were the NASA photo editors to curate the thousands of images that came back and choose the very best ones for distribution? \nThey ultimately did make their selections and the pictures they selected became icons: Buzz Aldrin’s crooked-armed pose in the Sea of Tranquility; the Apollo 17 flag pointing toward the Earth in the sky. What were missing were the more humanizing pictures: the outtakes showing the astronauts in a clumsy or unguarded moment; the moon bases looking like the sloppy campgrounds they were. \nNow, a group of European designers have selected the best of those unpolished images for a new book — Apollo VII – XVII. The video above includes a sampling of their work, and an explanation of why it matters.\nHere are the Apollo pictures and the stories behind them: Unseen Apollo, Going to the Moon Through Astronauts’ Eyes\nWrite to Jeffrey Kluger at jeffrey.kluger@time.com",

The lander targeted a southern portion of Apollo crater within the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) Basin on the lunar far side. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe landing is a critical step towards bringing unique and scientifically invaluable lunar samples to Earth for analysis. U.S. decadal surveys have highlighted an SPA sample return as a highest priority science objective.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chang’e-6 lander used a variable 7,500-newton-thrust engine to slow its velocity in lunar orbit and begin its descent. The lander was scheduled to make rapid positional adjustments at an altitude of around 2.5 kilometers above the lunar surface before continuing its descent. The spacecraft entered a hovering phase for fine hazard avoidance at approximately 100 meters above the surface. It used light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and optical cameras to find a safe landing spot.\n\n\n\n\n\nChang’e-6 is China’s fourth successful lunar landing from four attempts, and the second on the far side of the moon. It is also the third lunar landing in 2024. It follows Japan’s SLIM in January and Intuitive Machines’ IM-1 Odysseus lander in...[Content truncated]",

You can find links to all of the citizen science projects we mention in the transcript for this episode at nasa.gov. For sensitive listeners, this story includes descriptions of anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.**\n**HOST PADI BOYD: Emily Mason had been interested in astronomy as a child. But when she got to college, she became interested in completely unrelated topics. In 2011, she earned an undergraduate degree in Asian Studies.**\nEmily Mason:\nI had graduated and was supposed to go to Taiwan to start my master’s degree in cross-strait relations. And Curiosity landed on Mars.\n\\\nEmily Mason:\nand the six minute, or six or seven minutes of terror, or whatever it we watched it like come down and eject the different parts. And everyone was like, “Oh, God, don’t crash.”\n\\\nEmily Mason:\nAnd I sat up all night watching that with my mom. And I was like, oh, no, I went into the wrong field.\n\\, Kenneth Brian Lewis \\, James Matthew Stanfield \\, Bill Kendall Whittington \\\\]\nEmily Mason:\nSo I cancelled my plane ticket and re-enrolled at the university for astrophysics.\n**HOST PADI BOYD: Emily realized she loved space so much, she wanted to go back to school immediately. During her second time around in college, she discovered a citizen science project called** **.**\n**HOST PADI BOYD: Planet Hunters invites members of the public to look for exoplanets, which are planets around other stars. Users see graphs called light curves that show the amount of light coming from a star over time. If the amount of light dips and then comes back up, that could be a sign that a planet has crossed in front of a star, in an event called a transit.**\nEmily Mason:\nI was living at home to do the degree program again....[Content truncated]",

How else did the direc­tor get his hands on a super advanced lens from NASA to shoot those gor­geous can­dle-lit scenes in ? The film is slick­ly pro­duced and fea­tures an impres­sive array of inter­vie­wees from Hen­ry Kissinger, to Buzz Aldrin to Chris­tiane Kubrick. Some of the oth­er peo­ple inter­viewed include Jack Tor­rance and David Bow­man. If that’s not a tip off that the whole movie is fake, then the bloop­er reel at the end dri­ves the point home. Only a lot of peo­ple didn’t get the joke. Con­spir­a­cy enthu­si­asts  cit­ed the movie as fur­ther proof that the moon land­ing was faked.\nMoon hoax­ers like to point to  as a con­fes­sion by Kubrick that he was forced into a Big Lie.
