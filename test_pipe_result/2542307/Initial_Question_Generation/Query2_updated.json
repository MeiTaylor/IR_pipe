And there is a fluttering effect because the weak gravity on the Moon is not strong enough to uncrumple the flag. After a little waving while the astronauts planted the flags into the Moon\u2019s surface, they have remained still ever since.\n### Fried by radiation\nPerhaps the most convincing argument that the landings were faked has to do with something called the Van Allen belts. These are two giant doughnut-shaped belts surrounding the Earth. They are made of highly energetic charged particles from the solar wind. Some people believe humans couldn\u2019t have passed through these belts without being exposed to lethal doses of radiation.\nThis was a genuine concern before the Apollo missions. And it is the reason scientists behind Apollo 11 made sure they protected the astronauts as best they could. They insulated the spacecraft from radiation with an aluminium shell. And they chose a trajectory from the Earth to the Moon which minimised the amount of time spent in the Van Allen belts.\nReadings from the nine Apollo missions that reached the Moon showed the astronauts\u2019 average radiation exposure was 0.46 radiation-absorbed dose (rad). This proved Nasa was right to shield the astronauts from radiation. Though it\u2019s less than that experienced by some nuclear energy workers, 0.46 rad is around 10 times more than the radiation exposure of medical professionals who routinely work with x-ray and radiotherapy machines.\n### Proof we walked on the Moon\nOf course, until we return to the Moon there will always be anomalies and oddities in the records that can spark new claims that the Moon landings were faked. But it is the sheer size and variety of this record that proves every one of these claims to be false.\nFrom the Apollo Moon missions, there are 8,400 publicly available photos, thousands of hours of video footage, a mountain of scientific data, and full transcripts and audio recordings of all air-to-ground conversations. We even have 382 kilograms of Moon rock that Apollo astronauts brought back to Earth. These rocks have been independently verified as lunar by laboratories around the world, ruling out a US conspiracy.\nIf this is not enough to convince the most-hardened sceptic, Nasa\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) might sway them. Today, LRO takes high resolution pictures of the lunar surface from a low orbit. During its mission, it has captured the landing sites and the abandoned descent modules and rovers from the Apollo missions. And its resolution is so good it has picked up the dark squiggly paths that the astronaut\u2019s footprints made. Spacecraft from China, India and Japan have also spotted these...[Content truncated]",

Among 9/11 truthers, anti-vaxxers, chemtrailers, flat-Earthers, Holocaust deniers and Sandy Hook conspiracists, the idea that the moon landings were faked isn\u2019t even a source of anger any more \u2013 it is just a given fact.\nThe podcast kingpin Joe Rogan is among the doubters. So too is the YouTuber Shane Dawson. A sociology professor in New Jersey was exposed last year for telling his students the landings were fake. While Kaysing relied on photocopied samizdat to alert the world, now conspiracists have the subreddit r/moonhoax to document how Nasa was \u201cso lazy\u201d it used the same moon rover for Apollo 15, 16 and 17; or how \u201cthey have been trolling us for years\u201d; or to bring up the fact there is \u201cone thing I can\u2019t get my head around ...\u201d\n\u201cThe reality is, the internet has made it possible for people to say whatever the hell they like to a broader number of people than ever before,\u201d sighs Roger Launius, a former chief historian of Nasa. \u201cAnd the truth is, Americans love conspiracy theories. Every time something big happens, somebody has a counter-explanation.\u201d\nIt turns out British people love conspiracy theories, too. Last year, the daytime TV show This Morning welcomed a guest who argued that no one could have walked on the moon as the moon is made of light. Martin Kenny claimed: \u201cIn the past, you saw the moon landings and there was no way to check any of it. Now, in the age of technology, a lot of young people are now investigating for themselves.\u201d A recent YouGov poll found that one in six British people agreed with the statement: \u201cThe moon landings were staged.\u201d Four per cent believed the hoax theory was \u201cdefinitely true\u201d, 12% that it was \u201cprobably true\u201d, with a further 9% registering as don\u2019t knows. Moon hoaxism was more prevalent among the young: 21 % of 24- to 35-year-olds agreed that the moon landings were staged, compared with 13...[Content truncated]",

On a nationally representative survey, we asked whether people agreed, disagreed, or were unsure about these conspiracy claims\u2014and for comparison, asked similar questions about some basic scientific facts, such as whether Earth is billions of years old.\nAcceptance or openness to conspiracy beliefs was significantly higher among certain subgroups, including Millennials and supporters of ex-president Trump.
