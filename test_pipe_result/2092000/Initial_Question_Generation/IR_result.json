But why after so many years, you might have asked? And why have there been no official announcement or any celebrations? After all it was an UNESCO award, and not a joke.  \nBut that is exactly what it is. A rather imprudent joke, playing with the sentiment of millions of Indians.  \nWhen India Today wrote to the UNESCO asking for details and clarifications regarding this 'announcement', Sue Williams (Chief, Editorial, Press Relations and Unesco Courier, Bureau of Public Information, Unesco) wrote back that no such award has been announced.  \nShe wrote that the UNESCO was aware of this mail, but it was not true.  \n\"We are aware of several blogs in India reporting this story, but can assure you that Unesco has made no such announcement concerning the anthem of India or any country,\" she wrote.  \nSo why is this elaborate hoax? The mail, that comes with a picture of Rabindranath Tagore, the tricolour, the Ashoka Pillar and the text of_Jana Gana Mana_, India's National Anthem, looks innocent enough. It also carries a text message detailing the announcement and the history of the anthem.  \n...[Content truncated]",

        "Question": "Does the video provide credible evidence that UNESCO recognized 'Jana Gana Mana' as the best national anthem?",
        "Answer": "The video does not provide credible evidence that UNESCO recognized 'Jana Gana Mana' as the best national anthem. In fact, there is substantial evidence to contradict this claim. \n\n1. UNESCO itself has clarified that the claims circulating since 2008 regarding 'Jana Gana Mana' being declared the best national anthem are merely rumors. This misinformation has been debunked multiple times by credible sources and UNESCO has stated that no such announcement has been made regarding India's national anthem or any country's anthem.\n\n2. The prevalence of this misinformation is evident, as it has been circulated widely on social media and email, often with misleading or fabricated captions suggesting that such a declaration was made by UNESCO.\n\n3. Other reputable news sources have also reported that UNESCO has not recognized 'Jana Gana Mana' in any such capacity, reinforcing that this claim is a fabrication.\n\nTaken together, these points strongly indicate that the video does not provide any credible evidence supporting the claim that 'Jana Gana Mana' is recognized by UNESCO as the best national anthem.",
