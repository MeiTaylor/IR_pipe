A pop song, a rock song, a rap, a tv theme, an advertising jingle, a piece of classical music or even a jazz riff. For most of us the answer would be \u201cfairly often\u201d. It\u2019s in your head, you\u2019re humming it as you make breakfast or walk to the station or sit at the computer. It lingers right there in your mind for minutes, hours, sometimes even a whole day.\nNow consider how often you find yourself singing a national anthem as you sit at the traffic lights, take a shower, make a coffee. Have you ever?\nSo what\u2019s the problem with national anthems? Well, I see a bunch of problems \u2013 but to keep it simple may I suggest just two: the words and the music.\nLet me elaborate\u2026\n### _the music_\nNational anthems aren\u2019t cool. At all. They\u2019re almost without exception militaristic or regal, pompous, loud and/or brass band marching kinds of songs. They\u2019ll often start slowly, seriously and over the course of a couple of minutes build to a militaristic crescendo. And then repeat again, maybe twice again.\nThink of a few familiar ones: (click the titles to listen)\nBrass-bathed, god-loving, militaristically rousing. Great crowd-energising stuff.\nSame thing. A nice crescendo of the horns, big brass, meaty cymbal crashes.\nA marching tune if ever there was one. Ugh.\nWithout exception all just variations on a theme. The same old tired, heavy, serious and frankly dull theme.\nAnd if you\u2019re wondering whether I\u2019m just being Euro-focussed, try further afield:\nYes, it\u2019s all more of the same.\nAll these national anthems attempt to inspire a sense of power, love or pride for one\u2019s country, which one could argue is the sole point of a national anthem. But they\u2019re boring. They\u2019re predictable. They\u2019re old fashioned and over the top.\nWhy do they have to be so damn\u2026 dull and unsexy? Whatever happened to beauty?\nListen to this: it\u2019s \u541b\u304c\u4ee3 (Kimigayo), the Japanese national anthem. Listen all the way through \u2013 it lasts less than a minute.\n> ### .mp3)\nPompous? No.  \nMilitaristic? Absolutely not.  \nMarching tune?

UNESCO has not made any such declaration. The national anthem of any country is not ranked by UNESCO.\nClaim :\n-------\nFacebook user  shared the post on July 15. Caption reads, \u201cOur national anthem \u2013 \u201cJana Gana Mana Adhinayak Jai Hey Bharat Bhagya Vidhata\u201d has been declared as the best national anthem of the world.. UNESCO has declared it, as an Indian I am proud of it.. Jai hind, Bharat Mata ki Jai.\u201d\nOther  too are sharing the similar claims. The archive version of the post can be viewed by clicking .\nInvestigation:\n--------------\nTo know the truth of the viral claim, we took the help of Google Open Search. We started searching on Google with the help of related keywords, but we could not find any credible media reports related to the claim. If this news was true then there must have been some news report related to it. But we did not find any such report during the search.\nTaking the investigation further, we started scanning UNESCO\u2019s official  and social media . We could not find any information related to the viral claim even here.\nFor more information we contacted the UNESCO office in Delhi. They told us that the viral claim is false. UNESCO does not rank national anthems. No such survey or ranking is done by us. The national anthem is a way for all countries to show their love for their country.\nIn the last step of the investigation, we did a background check of the user who shared the post...[Content truncated]",
