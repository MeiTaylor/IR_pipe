But why after so many years, you might have asked? And why have there been no official announcement or any celebrations? After all it was an UNESCO award, and not a joke.  \nBut that is exactly what it is. A rather imprudent joke, playing with the sentiment of millions of Indians.  \nWhen India Today wrote to the UNESCO asking for details and clarifications regarding this 'announcement', Sue Williams (Chief, Editorial, Press Relations and Unesco Courier, Bureau of Public Information, Unesco) wrote back that no such award has been announced.  \nShe wrote that the UNESCO was aware of this mail, but it was not true.  \n\"We are aware of several blogs in India reporting this story, but can assure you that Unesco has made no such announcement concerning the anthem of India or any country,\" she wrote.  \nSo why is this elaborate hoax? The mail, that comes with a picture of Rabindranath Tagore, the tricolour, the Ashoka Pillar and the text of_Jana Gana Mana_, India's National Anthem, looks innocent enough. It also carries a text message detailing the announcement and the history of the anthem.  \n...[Content truncated]",
