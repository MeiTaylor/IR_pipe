You've seen them dominating your local grocery's pet food aisle. They are\u00a0easily the most popular dog treat on the market. And if you're not careful, feeding your pup loads of these unhealthy snacks can result in an unhealthy pet.\nThat can mean shorter life, skin disease, lack of energy and more!\nHere are 3 reasons why milk bones are unhealthy for your dog.\n1.  **Some brands pack sugar into their milk bones** - Milk Bones Essential plus Oral Care lists\u00a0sugar as a third ingredient in their milk bones.

On an initial watch, we noticed a brief\u00a0portion that cited\u00a0the unreliable health site Mercola.\u00a0We were unable to substantiate claims\u00a0that BHA, which is commonly used as a preservative in Milk-Bones (and many other dog treats), posed a risk to pets.\u201d_\nSnopes.com dismissed the evidence to risk of BHA in pet treats stating (bold added for emphasis): _\u201cWhile \u201cexperimental animals\u201d (presumably rats or mice) were mentioned, **dogs did not appear in that NIH document**.\u201d_ Snopes.com dismissed the risk to pets consuming BHA because this study was not performed on dogs (though it was performed on animals).\nBut\u2026to proves the safety of BHA in **dog treats** Snopes.com cited **a human study**. _\u201cThe association between dietary intake of BHA and BHT and stomach cancer risk was investigated in the Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) that started in 1986 among 120,852 men and women aged 55 to 69 years \u2026\u201d_\nSn...[Content truncated]",

Higher amounts of physical activity may be even better for lowering cancer risk.\nFor people who are not active or just starting a physical activity program, activity levels below the recommended levels can still help your health, especially your heart. The amount and intensity of activity can then be increased slowly over time. Most children and young adults can safely do moderate and/or vigorous activities without checking with their doctors. But men older than 40 years, women older than 50 years, and people with chronic illnesses or risk factors for heart disease should check with their doctors before starting a vigorous activity program.\n**Children and teens** should be encouraged to be active at moderate to vigorous intensities for at least an hour a day, every day. This should include muscle-strengthening activities at least 3 days a week. Activities should be age appropriate, enjoyable, and varied, including sports and fitness activities in school, at home, and in the community. To help reach activity goals, daily physical education programs and activity breaks should be provided for children at school, and \"screen time\" (TV viewing, playing video games, or time spent on the phone or computer) should be limited at home.\n### Limiting time spent sitting\nThere is growing evidence that the amount of time spent sitting is important, regardless of your activity level. Sitting time raises the risks of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some types of cancer, as well as of dying at a younger age.\nLifestyle changes and advances in technology have led to people being less active and spending more time sitting each day. This is true both in the workplace and at home, due to increased TV, computer, and other screen time. Limiting the amount of time spent sitting, as suggested in the table below, may help maintain a healthy body weight and reduce the risk of certain cancers.\n**Tips to reduce sitting time**\n*   Limit time spent watching TV and using other forms of screen-based entertainment.\n*   Use a stationary bike or treadmill when you do watch TV.\n*   Use stairs rather than an elevator.\n*   If you can, walk or bike to your destination.\n*   Exercise at lunch with your coworkers, family, or friends.\n*   Take an exercise break at work to stretch or take a quick walk.\n*   Walk to visit coworkers instead of phoning or sending an e-mail.\n*   Go dancing with your spouse or friends.\n*   Plan active vacations rather than only sightseeing trips.\n*   Wear a...[Content truncated]",

The truth is that rawhide poses risks to your dog beyond simple witticism. Ultimately, rawhide dog treats good or bad, should not be given to your dog without direct supervision.\nAre Jerky Treats Bad for Dogs?\n------------------------------\nVeterinarians state there is quality dog jerky on the market. However, veterinarians are quick to warn an owner to feed only high quality dog jerky. The FDA issued a 2011 bulletin warning during a national panic for chicken, duck, and sweet potato dog jerky, linked to product from China and other overseas countries.\nThe number one culprit for dogs is jerky\u2019s high sodium content. Small levels of salt are not necessarily bad for a dog, salt being a necessary component to maintain its health. However, high levels of salt in a dog\u2019s diet can lead to sodium poisoning and symptoms that can be fatal.\nSymptoms of sodium poisoning:\n*   Coma\n*   Diminished Appetite\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Edema\n*   Elevated Heart Rate\n*   Excessive Thirst\n*   Excessive Urination\n*   Uncoordination\n*   Lethargy\n*   Seizures\n*   Tremors\n*   Vomiting\nVeterinarians embrace natural dog jerky as a healthy treat for your dog. When choosing dog jerky, make sure it is naturally dehydrated and from a single protein source. Veterinarians recommend that jerky be made without added preservatives, salt, and spices. Look at DogDeli Natural Air-Dried Jerky.\nAre Milk Bone Treats Bad for Dogs?\n----------------------------------\nMilk bones have been touted for years as an essential treat to maintain a dog\u2019s healthy teeth. As a result, milk bones have become a national standard dog treat. But most owners don\u2019t know that commercial milk bones often contain high levels of unhealthy ingredients like sugar, wheat, and BHA.\nSugar in Milk Bone Treats\n-------------------------\nAccording to a study by the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention, 53.9% of dogs in the US are overweight. Sugar is enticing to dogs. So, manufacturers have added this sweetener to entice a dog\u2019s preference. Sugar impacts the health and welfare of dogs as it does humans. Not only does sugar cause dog obesity, it can lead to high blood sugar, dental ailments and cardiovascular disease.\nBHA in Milk Bone Treats...[Content truncated]",

But you can reduce your risk by keeping a healthy weight and eating a healthy balanced diet.\nWhat are carcinogenic foods?\n----------------------------\nIf something is carcinogenic, it means that it could cause cancer.

As a precaution, you should avoid close contact with pregnant women, babies and young children for 6 hours after the scan.\nYou\u00a0need someone to take you home and stay overnight if you\u2019ve had medicine to help you relax (sedative).\u00a0For the next 24hours you also shouldn\u2019t:\nIf travelling abroad within a week of your PET scan, it's a good idea to take your appointment letter with you. This is because most airports have sensitive radiation monitors. This may pick up a trace of radiation left in your body following your test.\nA PET scan is a safe test for most people. But like all medical tests it has some risks. Your doctor and radiographer make sure the benefits of having the test outweigh these risks.\nSome of the possible risks include:\nPregnant women should only have the scan in an emergency. There\u2019s a risk that the radiation could harm the developing baby. Contact the department beforehand if you're pregnant or think you might be\u00a0pregnant.\nIf you're breastfeeding, let the department know a few days before your appointment. They will let you know if you need to stop breastfeeding for a length of time after having the radioactive tracer. You might need to store enough expressed milk for at least one feed.\nExposure to radiation from the radioactive tracer during a PET scan slightly increases your risk of developing cancer in the future. Talk to your doctor\u00a0if this worries you.\u00a0\nYou might get a small bruise around the area where they put the needle in.\u00a0\nThere is a risk that the radioactive tracer will leak outside the vein. This can cause swelling and pain in your arm but it's rare.\nRarely, people have an allergic reaction to the radioactive tracer. This most often starts with weakness, sweating and difficulty breathing. Tell your radiographer immediately if you feel unwell.\nYour scan will be looked at by a specialist doctor and you should get\u00a0your results within 1 or 2 weeks. You won't get any results at the time of the scan.\u00a0\nWaiting for results can make you anxious. Ask your doctor or nurse how long it will take to get them. Contact them\u00a0if you haven\u2019t heard anything after a couple of weeks.\nYou might have the contact\u00a0details for a specialist nurse. You can contact them for information and support if you need to. It may help to talk to a close friend or relative about how you feel.\u00a0\nWe have more information on tests,\u00a0t...[Content truncated]",
