According to the Environmental Working Group: “A scientific panel created by the European Food Safety Authority found that titanium dioxide “can no longer be considered as safe when used as a food additive.” The panel, citing concerns about titanium dioxide’s genotoxicity, or its ability to damage DNA, based its conclusion on a review of hundreds of scientific studies. EWG called on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to quickly consider whether to ban titanium dioxide from use in food.\"  A chemical that may damage our pet's DNA should NOT be fed to pets.😡  Titanium dioxide has always been on our Dirty Dozen list of additives you need to avoid in your pet food and one of the many reasons why we created easy-to-make additive-free versions",
