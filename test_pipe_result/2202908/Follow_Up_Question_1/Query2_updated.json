My name is\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* am a licensed veterinarian and I will be assisting you today. First I need to ask you a few questions so that I can be well informed and give you the best advice.\n1- Is she showing any symptoms?\n!\nDiscover more answers\nCustomer\nNo..when I came how she was excited as normal & boucing all around so pleased at what she had done. She is lying on the floor now which is normal.\nCustomer\nHer eyes look normal, breathing normal. Just concerned about the amount and since it contains vitamins..worried about maybe diarrhea.\n]\nFriend, she can not overdose on the ingredients of these milk bones, she could develop some vomiting or dietary otherwise she will be fine. I would keep an eye on her if she develops vomiting or diarrhea this is what you can do:\n1- Do not give things like Pepto Bismol or imodium. Start her on Pepcid AC (famotidine) 10mg tablet every 12 hours for the next 2-3 days. You can buy Pepcid AC over the counter in any pharmacy.\n2- No food or water for 8-12 hours. Need to give her gastrointestinal tract time to rest.\n3- After 8-12 hours offer a small amount of water. Wait half hour, if no vomiting, offer small amount of rice (50%) and boiled boneless chicken or ground beef (50%) 4-6 times a day. Keep on this diet for several days then wean into regular diet.\n4- If she continues to vomit after doing the above she will need to be seen by your family veterinarian for a hands on examination.\nMy goal is to provide you with excellent service - I hope I've provided the information you were seeking, if you feel you have received anything less, please reply back as I am happy to address follow-up questions. Kindly rate me when you are done.\nCustomer\nThank you. I will keep an eye on her.\n]\nYou're welcome. :)\n]\nHi Stacy, I'm just following up on our conversation about Mandy. How is everything going?

For example, if your dog breaks off large chunks and swallows them whole, that could lead to serious complications like choking or an . Whenever you give your dog a new type of chew, always keep an eye on them to be sure it\u2019s a safe choice.\nWhat to Look for in an Edible Dog Chew\n--------------------------------------\nThe following list will help you choose an appropriate chew:\n*   **Hardness**: Chews that are too hard can crack your dog\u2019s teeth or cut their gums.\n*   **Durability**: The chew should be strong enough to withstand vigorous chewing. If it\u2019s too soft, your dog can break off chunks and swallow them whole, which is a health hazard.\n*   **Long-lasting**: Look for edible dog chews that will last. These options will keep your dog occupied for longer and provide more value.\n*   **Size**: Chews that are too small for your dog present a choking risk. Pick edible dog chews that are large enough so your dog can\u2019t get the entire thing in their mouth at once.\n*   **Ingredients**: Look for limited, natural ingredients. Avoid any flavorings or coatings that could upset your dog\u2019s stomach.\nIf you have any concerns about your choice of edible dog chews, consult your veterinarian.\n!\n\u00a9Christian M\u00fcller - stock.adobe.com\nTypes of Edible Dog Chews\n-------------------------\nHere are some of the more common chews.\n### Rawhide\nRawhide, which is made from the inner layer of horse or cowhide, is a popular chew, but  depends on the dog. Power chewers can break off large pieces. If your dog swallows these chunks, they can choke, or a piece can become lodged in their intestines.\nRawhide is also difficult to digest. Pieces will pass through the digestive system whole, which is why they pose an obstruction risk. If you choose to provide rawhide, prevent your dog from eating large pieces by removing any chunks as soon as your dog breaks them off. Once your dog has chewed the rawhide so that it\u2019s small enough to swallow in one piece, take it away from your dog.\n### Bully Sticks\nUnlike rawhide,\u00a0, sometimes known as pizzle sticks, are easily digestible. Single-ingredient chews made from beef muscle, bully sticks range in thicknesses and lengths. They also come braided and shaped for an extra-long chew. They do not splinter. Instead, the end of...[Content truncated]",

A safe one, from a dental-health perspective, counts as a bone that helps cleanse the teeth via chewing, but isn\u2019t so hard that it causes a dental fracture (aka, a cracked tooth). \n\u201cDog teeth are hollow like ours. When a dog breaks a tooth, it\u2019s not only painful, but it also exposes the root so that bacteria can get inside and lead to infection,\u201d explains Dr. Carmichael. Several times a week, he sees a dog who has suffered a dental fracture due to chewing on a bone \u2014 which, for scale, has added up to \u201cprobably 10,000 dogs over the course of my career.\u201d\nNYC\u2019s top veterinary dentist on bad breath, dental disease, and brushing your dog\u2019s teeth...daily.\nThen there\u2019s the gastrointestinal (GI) aspect: Many bones present digestive hazards, especially when they can be torn into large and ingestible chunks, says Dr. Yuri Lawrence, PhD, a veterinarian and mobile internist in Austin, Texas. If a large piece is ingested, it could get stuck in the esophagus, causing breathing problems, or in the GI tract, which can create inflammation and invite vomiting, loss of appetite, and serious discomfort. Often, surgery is the only option.\nWith the help of our experts, The Wildest put together a guide to navigating the bone aisle, separating the safe from the downright dangerous choices out there. And, word to the wise (those who, like me, throw a guilt-bone on their way out the door): Only give your dog a bone when you\u2019re home to monitor them. Not only will it help you learn your dog\u2019s (potentially hazardous) chewing habits, you\u2019ll also thank yourself in the event that something bad happens.\n In both the dental and digestive departments, pig ears fly high. (They\u2019re also a sustainable option). Because the texture is relatively thin compared to most bones, there\u2019s less risk of your dog cracking a tooth while chewing on it, says Dr. Carmichael. And when it comes to GI problems, Dr. Lawrence has yet to have dog come in for an internal issue from eating a pig ear. \u201cAs long as it seems like the right size for your dog\u201d \u2014 as in, something they can properly chew up \u2014 \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have to worry.\u201d\nSimilar to pig ears, bully sticks \u2014 which are actually dried, cured bull penis, BTW \u2014 are generally safe on the oral front, because they soften as they\u2019re chewed, says Dr. Carmichael. The curled sticks are also hard to snap in half, says Dr. Lawrence, making them...[Content truncated]",

For a general overview, see our consumer fact sheet.\nThis fact sheet provides an overview of selected ingredients in dietary supplements designed or claimed to enhance exercise and athletic performance. Manufacturers and sellers promote these products, sometimes referred to as ergogenic aids, by claiming that they improve strength or endurance, increase exercise efficiency, achieve a performance goal more quickly, and increase tolerance for more intense training. These effects are the main focus of this fact sheet. Some people also use ergogenic aids to prepare the body for exercise, reduce the chance of injury during training, and enhance recovery from exercise [1,2].\nDietary supplements to enhance exercise and athletic performance come in a variety of forms, including tablets, capsules, liquids, powders, and bars. Many of these products contain numerous ingredients in varied combinations and amounts. Among the more common ingredients are amino acids, protein, creatine, and caffeine. According to one estimate, retail sales of the category of sports nutrition supplements totaled $5.67 billion in 2016, or 13.8% of $41.16 billion total sales for dietary supplements and related nutrition products for that year [3].\nSeveral surveys have indicated the extent of dietary supplement use for bodybuilding and to enhance exercise and athletic performance:\nIt is difficult to make generalizations about the extent of dietary supplement use by athletes because the studies on this topic are heterogeneous. However, the data suggest that [9]:\nFor any individual to physically perform at his or her best, a nutritionally adequate diet and sufficient hydration are critical.
