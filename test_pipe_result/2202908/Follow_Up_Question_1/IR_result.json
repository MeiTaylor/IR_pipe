Puppies can be unpredictable chewers and have sharper teeth than older dogs, which increases the risk for broken pieces that may pose a swallowing hazard. Long lasting treats are also not recommended for dogs known to gulp their food.\nWhat size Milk-Bone® Wonder Bones® Paw Rockers® should I give my dog?\nMilk-Bone® Wonder Bones® Paw Rockers® Small/Medium Made With USA-Raised Beef or USA-Raised Chicken are ideal for adult dogs that weigh more than 13 pounds.\n\nIf your adult dog is between 5 and 30 pounds, we recommend the Milk-Bone® Wonder Bones® Paw Rockers® Mini Made With USA-Raised Chicken.\nAre Milk-Bone® Wonder Bones® Paw Rockers® good for dogs with sensitive stomachs?\nMilk-Bone® Wonder Bones® Paw Rockers® are easy on the digestive system and are designed to be eaten slowly. If your dog does well with low-fat, low-fiber and lower protein dog treats, Paw Rockers® may be a good option. Whether or not your dog has a history of upset stomach, we recommend introducing new foods and treats slowly.\nIs it safe to leave my dog unattended with Milk-Bone® Wonder Bones® Paw Rockers®?\nMilk-Bone® Wonder Bones® Paw Rockers® are designed to break down in your dog’s stomach, but it is always prudent to make sure your dog is not gulping the bones. It is important to monitor your dog while he or she is enjoying a chew to make sure they aren’t chewing too rapidly or trying to swallow large or sharp pieces.\nMy dog has preexisting periodontal disease or inflammation of their gums. Should they enjoy a Milk-Bone® Wonder Bones® Paw Rockers® treat?\nAlthough uncommon, long lasting treats like Milk-Bone® Wonder Bones® Paw Rockers® may make dogs’ gums more irritated or bleed more easily if they have a history of periodontal disease or inflammation of the gums. If your dog is experiencing discomfort, please contact your trusted veterinarian for guidance.\nWhat is the chew time?\nAverage chew time varies based on many factors such as your dog’s size, age, excitement to chew, etc. However, we have seen anywhere from:\nHow should I store Milk-Bone® Wonder Bones® Paw Rockers®?\nUnopened, Milk-Bone® Wonder Bones® Paw Rockers® should be stored in a cool, dry location for up...[Content truncated]",

For example, if your dog breaks off large chunks and swallows them whole, that could lead to serious complications like choking or an . Whenever you give your dog a new type of chew, always keep an eye on them to be sure it’s a safe choice.\nWhat to Look for in an Edible Dog Chew\n--------------------------------------\nThe following list will help you choose an appropriate chew:\n*   **Hardness**: Chews that are too hard can crack your dog’s teeth or cut their gums.\n*   **Durability**: The chew should be strong enough to withstand vigorous chewing. If it’s too soft, your dog can break off chunks and swallow them whole, which is a health hazard.\n*   **Long-lasting**: Look for edible dog chews that will last. These options will keep your dog occupied for longer and provide more value.\n*   **Size**: Chews that are too small for your dog present a choking risk. Pick edible dog chews that are large enough so your dog can’t get the entire thing in their mouth at once.\n*   **Ingredients**: Look for limited, natural ingredients. Avoid any flavorings or coatings that could upset your dog’s stomach.\nIf you have any concerns about your choice of edible dog chews, consult your veterinarian.\n!\n©Christian Müller - stock.adobe.com\nTypes of Edible Dog Chews\n-------------------------\nHere are some of the more common chews.\n### Rawhide\nRawhide, which is made from the inner layer of horse or cowhide, is a popular chew, but  depends on the dog. Power chewers can break off large pieces. If your dog swallows these chunks, they can choke, or a piece can become lodged in their intestines.\nRawhide is also difficult to digest. Pieces will pass through the digestive system whole, which is why they pose an obstruction risk. If you choose to provide rawhide, prevent your dog from eating large pieces by removing any chunks as soon as your dog breaks them off. Once your dog has chewed the rawhide so that it’s small enough to swallow in one piece, take it away from your dog.\n### Bully Sticks\nUnlike rawhide, , sometimes known as pizzle sticks, are easily digestible. Single-ingredient chews made from beef muscle, bully sticks range in thicknesses and lengths. They also come braided and shaped for an extra-long chew. They do not splinter.

        "Question": "What additional studies or expert analyses assess the safety of ingredients in Milk-Bone treats for dogs?",
        "Answer": "The safety of ingredients in Milk-Bone treats for dogs has been assessed by various studies and expert analyses, but the conclusions vary depending on the specific ingredients evaluated. Here is a summary of key findings:\n\n1. **BHA (Butylated Hydroxyanisole)**: A significant concern mentioned in discussions around Milk-Bone treats is the presence of BHA, a preservative. Although there have been sensational claims regarding its carcinogenicity, reputable sources, including veterinary blogs, assert that BHA is deemed safe in the trace amounts used in pet foods. The Patton Veterinary Hospital, for example, reassures clients about the safety of Milk-Bone treats, stating that they use them in their practice and observe that many staff members feed them to their own pets without concern.\n\n2. **Titanium Dioxide**: Dr. Karen Becker reports that certain chemicals used in Milk-Bone treats, specifically titanium dioxide, have come under scrutiny. According to a scientific panel from the European Food Safety Authority, titanium dioxide is no longer considered safe as a food additive due to concerns about its genotoxic properties, meaning it may damage DNA. This assessment is based on a comprehensive review of scientific studies highlighting potential risks associated with titanium dioxide. This represents a more recent concern that could impact the perceived safety of Milk-Bone treats.\n\n3. **General Veterinary Assessment**: The general consensus among veterinarians is that Milk-Bone treats can be safely consumed by dogs in moderation. Many professionals support the inclusion of these treats in pet diets, suggesting that they are not inherently unhealthy and do not pose a significant risk.\n\nOverall, while some studies and experts express concerns about specific ingredients like titanium dioxide, there is still a strong body of evidence and professional opinion supporting the safety of Milk-Bone treats when provided as part of a balanced diet.",
