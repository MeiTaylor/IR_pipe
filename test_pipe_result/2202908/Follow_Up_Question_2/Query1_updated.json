Several studies observed that the pet food characteristics, the sources from which the owners receive dietary recommendation, and the relationship between owners and their pets can influence the choice of food they will buy [4\u20136]. The difficulty in understanding labels can also influence this decision, since many owners do not understand ingredient description as well as the presence of preservatives and may opt for foods that do not contain these ingredients [2,7].\nFood additives are ingredients added intentionally in diets with the aim of modifying the physical, chemical, biological, or sensory characteristics during the process of manufacturing a food [8]. Additives can be dyes, emulsifiers, or antioxidants, both natural such as tocopherols, or synthetic such as butylhydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) [9]. Without these additives, there can be alterations in the food characteristics and, consequently, alterations in the nutritional value, including oxidation of fatty acids [9]. Despite the effect in food preservation, many owners are concerned about preservatives with allegations of toxicity or even carcinogenesis [2,10].\nAccording to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the information alone does not produce or change behavior unless there is a change in the subject\u2019s attitude [11]. TPB proposes that behaviors can be predicted by: (a) attitudes; (b) subjective norms, which are how much the subject believes that others influence the behavior; (c) and perceived behavioral control, which is the perception of the subject over the ability to execute the behavior [11]. Few studies evaluated the beliefs of dog owners, and most of them show descriptive or quantitative results [4,10]. Therefore, behavioral analysis according to the TPB can bring important information to the pet food industry and professionals on how to approach some themes with pet owners [12].\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the applicability of TPB and its ability to predict dog owner behavior, as well as evaluate the difference in owner eating habits and the habits they impose on their dogs regarding foods with or without preservatives.\nFor this prospective study a questionnaire was elaborated containing two sets of questions: a first set with 16 questions related to the owners and dog characteristics; and a second set with 38 affirmations regarding direct and indirect measures for the TPB analysis. A pilot questionnaire was first applied and a convenience sample of 6 individuals was used to obtain feedback to elaborate the final version of the questionnaire. The final questionnaire was divided into four sections...[Content truncated]",

                    "content": "[Content truncated]...: Many plastic products are mischaracterized as being EA free if extracted with only one solvent and not exposed to common-use stresses. However, we can identify existing compounds, or have developed, monomers, additives, or processing agents that have no detectable EA and have similar costs. Hence, our data suggest that EA-free plastic products exposed to common-use stresses and extracted by saline and ethanol solvents could be cost-effectively made on a commercial scale and thereby eliminate a potential health risk posed by most currently available plastic products that leach chemicals having EA into food products.\nChemicals that mimic or antagonize the actions of naturally occurring estrogens are defined as having estrogenic activity (EA), which is the most common form of endocrine disruptor activity [Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) 2003, 2006; National Research Council 1999]. Chemicals having EA typically interact with one or more of the classical nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) subtypes: ER\u03b1, ER\u03b2, or nonclassical membrane or ER-related subtypes (Hewitt et al. 2005; Matsushima et al. 2008; National Research Council 1999). In mammals, chemicals having EA can produce many health-related problems, such as early puberty in females, reduced sperm counts, altered functions of reproductive organs, obesity, altered sex-specific behaviors, and increased rates of some breast, ovarian, testicular, and prostate cancers (Della Seta et al. 2006; Gray 2008; Kabuto et al. 2004; National Research Council 1999; Newbold et al. 2004; Patisaul et al. 2006, 2009). Fetal, newborn, and juvenile mammals are especially sensitive to very low (sometimes picomolar to nanomolar) doses of chemicals having EA (Gray 2008; vom Saal et al. 2005). Many of these effects observed in mammals are also expected to be produced in humans, because basic endocrine mechanisms have been highly conserved across all classes of vertebrates (Kavlock et al. 1996; National Research Council 1999).\nThermoplastics, which are used for many items that contain food, are made by polymerizing a specific monomer or monomers in the presence of catalysts into a high-molecular-weight chain known as a thermoplastic polymer [see Supplemental Material, Figure 1 (doi:10.1289/ehp.1003220)]. The resulting polymer is mixed with small quantities of various additives (ant...[Content truncated]",

Although this is a lovely idea, it is rarely the case. When animals are slaughtered for food production, the lean muscle is cut off for human consumption. The remaining carcass (bones, organs, blood, beaks, etc.) is what goes into pet food, commonly known as \"by-products,\" \"meal,\" \"by-product meal,\" or the like. Read on if you are not faint of heart.\u00a0\nIn addition to the carcasses described above, other \"leftovers\" from the human food industry (restaurant grease, out-of-date supermarket meat, etc) and \"4D\" livestock animals (dead, dying, diseased, disabled) may also be found in pet food through a process called rendering. Rendering is defined as \"an industrial process of extraction by melting that converts waste animal tissue into usable materials\".\u00a0 In other words, rendering involves placing livestock carcasses and possibly \"leftovers\" into huge vats, grinding it up and cooking it for several hours.\u00a0 Rendering separates fat, removes water, and kills bacteria, viruses, parasites and other infectious organisms. The fat that is separated becomes \"animal fat\" that goes into pet food (for example, chicken fat, beef fat, etc). The remaining dried protein solids become \"meal\" or meat \"by-product meal\" for addition to pet food.\u00a0 Read on for some additional disturbing definitions:\r\n\u00a0\nBy-products (for example, chicken by-products or beef by-products): clean non-rendered \"parts\", other than meat, derived from slaughtered mammals. It includes, but is not limited to lungs, spleen, kidneys, brain, blood, bone, fatty tissue and stomachs and intestines freed of their contents. This is a cheap way for pet food companies to keep the protein levels \"high\" (although not high quality) while keeping food production costs low.\u00a0\nMeat Meal (for example, lamb meal): in this example, all lamb tissues, exclusive of blood, hair, hoof, horn, hide trimmings, manure, stomach and rumen contents that are cooked (rendered). After cooking, the dried solids are added as \"meal\" to pet food.\nMeat By-product Meal (for example, chicken by-product meal): chicken by-products (defined above) that are cooked (rendered).
