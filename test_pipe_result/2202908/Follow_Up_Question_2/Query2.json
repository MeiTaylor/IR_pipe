VOCs include a variety of chemicals, some of which may have short- and long-term adverse health effects. Concentrations of many VOCs are consistently higher indoors (up to ten times higher) than outdoors. VOCs are emitted by a wide array of products numbering in the thousands.\nOrganic chemicals are widely used as ingredients in household products. Paints, varnishes and wax all contain organic solvents, as do many cleaning, disinfecting, cosmetic, degreasing and hobby products. Fuels are made up of organic chemicals. All of these products can release organic compounds while you are using them, and, to some degree, when they are stored.\nEPA's Office of Research and Development's \"Total Exposure Assessment Methodology (TEAM) Study\" (Volumes I through IV, completed in 1985) found levels of about a dozen common organic pollutants to be 2 to 5 times higher inside homes than outside, regardless of whether the homes were located in rural or highly industrial areas. TEAM studies indicated that while people are using products containing organic chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to very high pollutant levels, and elevated concentrations can persist in the air long after the activity is completed.\n* * *\nSources of VOCs\n---------------\nHousehold products, including:\n*   paints, paint strippers and other solvents...[Content truncated]",

These toxins are not harmful to the organisms themselves but they may be toxic to other creatures, including humans, when eaten. These chemical compounds have diverse structures and differ in biological function and toxicity.\nSome toxins are produced by plants as a natural defense mechanism against predators, insects or microorganisms, or as consequence of infestation with microorganisms, such as mould, in response to climate stress (such as drought or extreme humidity).\nOther sources of natural toxins are microscopic algae and plankton in oceans or sometimes in lakes that produce chemical compounds that are toxic to humans but not to fish or shellfish that eat these toxin-producing organisms. When people eat fish or shellfish that contain these toxins, illness can rapidly follow.\nSome of the most commonly found natural toxins that can pose a risk to our health are described below.\n**Aquatic biotoxins**\n---------------------\nToxins formed by algae in the ocean and fresh water are called algal toxins. Algal toxins are generated during blooms of particular naturally occurring algal species. Shellfish such as mussels, scallops and oysters are more likely to contain these toxins than fish. Algal toxins can cause diarrhea, vomiting, tingling, paralysis and other effects in humans, other mammals or fish. The algal toxins can be retained in shellfish and fish or contaminate drinking water. They have no taste or smell, and are not eliminated by cooking or freezing.\nAnother example is ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) which is caused by consuming fish contaminated with dinoflagellates that produce ciguatoxins. Some fish known to harbour ciguatoxins include barracuda, black grouper, dog snapper, and king mackerel. Symptoms of ciguatera poisoning include nausea, vomiting, and neurologic symptoms, such as tingling sensation on fingers and toes. There is currently no specific treatment for ciguatera poisoning.\n**Cyanogenic glycosides**\n-------------------------\nCyanogenic glycosides are phytoto...[Content truncated]",

They intensify colour, thicken, increase shelf life and enhance flavour. Regulatory authorities issue approvals as safe within acceptable quantitative limits. Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) contain combinations of all these additives and are particularly attractive to children.Many publications suggest that artificial colourants, benzoate preservatives, non-caloric sweeteners, emulsifiers and their degradation derivatives have adverse effects by increasing risks of mental health disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and potential carcinogenic effects.A systematic review has established that artificial azo dye food colourants (AFCs) and sodium benzoate preservative cause disturbed behaviour in children. AFCs and benzoates in animal models have neurotoxic properties through gut microbial generation of toxic metabolites. Observational studies show associations between high emulsifier intake and cardiovascular disease. Animal models and in vitro studies have highlighted neurotoxic, cytotoxic, genotoxic and carcinogenic effects. High intake of non-caloric sweeteners has been linked to cardiovascular disease and depression in adults and is linked to childhood obesity.Little research has focused on children who are the largest consumers of UPFs. Potentially, they are a ticking time bomb for adult obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, mental health disorders and cancers. Based on risk/benefit analysis, azo dye AFCs should be banned. Benzoates, emulsifiers and sweeteners require assessment of quantitative limits and cumulative effects of combinations. Consumers purchasing UPFs require information through ingredient health warnings and recommendations to use natural unprocessed foods which have well-described health-promoting properties.\n**Keywords:** Child Health; Mental health; Obesity; Toxicology.\n© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

We agree that this is an important question.\nCDC/ATSDR recognizes that exposure to high levels of PFAS may impact the immune system. A National Toxicology Program review found that exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is an immune hazard to humans based on a high level of evidence that PFOA and PFOS suppressed the antibody response from animals and a moderate level of evidence from studies in humans (NTP, 2016). More research is needed to understand how PFAS exposure may affect illness from COVID-19.\n**Reference:  \n**NTP (National Toxicology Program). 2016. .\n!\nResearch is ongoing to understand the mechanisms of PFAS toxicity. The epidemiological evidence suggests associations between increases in exposure to (specific) PFAS and certain health effects\n!\nIncreases in cholesterol levels (PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, PFDA)\n!\nLower antibody response to some vaccines (PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFDA)\n!\nChanges in liver enzymes (PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS)\n!\nPregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia (PFOA, PFOS)\n!\nSmall decreases in birth weight (PFOA, PFOS)\n!\nKidney and testicular cancer (PFOA)\nThe risk of health effects associated with PFAS depends on\n*   Exposure factors (e.g., dose, frequency, route, and duration)\n*   Individual factors (e.g., sensitivity and disease burden)\n*   Other determinants of health (e.g., access to safe water and quality healthcare)\nSome animal and human studies find positive associations between PFAS exposure and a much wider range of health effects. However, results of animal studies do not always correlate with human health effects because of physiologic differences between species. Inconsistent findings among human studies and study design limitations are some reasons why other potential health effects are not identified as associated with PFAS.\nAt this time, scientists are still learning about the health effects of exposures to mixtures of different PFAS. Additional research may change our understanding of the relationship between exposure to PFAS and human health effects.\nOne way to learn about whether PFAS will harm people is to do studies on lab animals.\n*   Most animal studies have tested doses of PFAS that are higher than the doses people experience from environmental exposure.\n*   These animal studies have found that PFAS can cause damage to the liver and the immune system.\n*   PFAS have also caused low birth weight, birth defects, delayed...[Content truncated]",

The risk depends on the kind of preservative, the amount in your pet's food, and how much they are having. But if you're concerned about preservatives in your pet's food, there are preservative-free cat foods available.  To understand what exactly preservatives are, the different types, their potential risks, and alternatives, keep reading!\nA preservative is a substance or a chemical that is added to products to prolong their shelf life. Preservatives are used in foods, beverages, pharmaceutical drugs, paints, biological samples, cosmetics, and even wood. Their primary function is to prevent decomposition caused by microbial growth or undesirable chemical changes. Preservatives can be natural or synthetic; for example vinegar, salt, sugar, and certain spices have been used for centuries to preserve food. \nBoth synthetic and natural preservatives can be added to cat food.1 \nSynthetic preservatives - Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) are the most common two synthetic preservatives that are added to cat food. BHA is a synthetic antioxidant that helps prevent the oxidation of fats in cat food. BHT is a synthetic antioxidant that is used to prevent the rancidity of fats and oils in cat food. Ascorbic acid and Ethoxyquin are two more preservatives commonly used in pet food. \nNatural Preservatives – Preservatives derived from natural sources are often used to prevent oxidation and inhibit the growth of bacteria and mold. The common ones include – \nVitamin E (a.k.a tocopherols): Vitamin E is a natural antioxidant that helps prevent the oxidation of fats and oils in cat food.\nVitamin C (a.k.a ascorbic acid): Ascorbic acid acts as an antioxidant and helps maintain the freshness of cat food.\nVinegar and citric acid are also used as natural options for preservation in cat food.\nPreservatives do serve an important purpose when it comes to cat food. The benefits of the same can include –\nIncreased Shelf Life: They help maintain the freshness of cat food by preventing spoilage, rancidity, and microbial growth. This helps reduce the risk of foodborne illnesses in cats. \nNut...[Content truncated]",

Benzene occurs naturally and also results from human activities. Forest fires and volcanoes produce benzene. It's in gasoline and cigarette smoke. \nYou can be exposed to benzene from car exhaust, and emissions from gas stations and factories. At home, benzene might come from detergents, paint, glue, or furniture wax. \nIn the 1990s, the FDA learned that benzene was present in some soft drinks. Some drink makers used sodium benzoate and ascorbic acid in their formulas. Starting in 2005, the FDA tested more than 200 soft drinks for benzene. Benzene above what's considered a safe level was found in ...[Content truncated]",

Regulatory guidance such as ADIs and MRLs fully reflect the impact on human gastrointestinal microflora. However, before deciding on any risk management options, risk assessments of antimicrobial resistance require large-scale evidence regarding the relationship between antimicrobial use in food-producing animals and the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in human pathogens. In this article, the risk profiles of hormonal and antibacterial growth promoters are provided based on recent toxicity and human exposure information, and recommendations for risk management to prevent human health impacts by the use of growth promoters are also presented.\nVeterinary drugs including antibiotics, growth hormones, and antihelminths are used for disease control and growth promotion of livestock animals. However, concerns regarding the safety of livestock products and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance have grown according to the increased use of veterinary drugs.\nRisk assessment is an integrative strategy to assume the probability of human illness caused by the ingestion of livestock products containing residual veterinary drugs. Both antimicrobials and growth hormones used for growth promotion in food-producing animals have provoked much debate on the safety of livestock products for human consumption. Many studies have been performed to estimate the real probability of human health impact. We need to understand the human health risks of antimicrobials and growth hormones under a framework basis composed of assessments of exposure amounts, dose-response relationships, and human illness consequences.\nThe major goal of this article is to illustrate methods for the risk assessment of growth hormones and antimicrobials and to provide the results of quantitative risk assessments of them based on current scientific knowledge and available data.\nVeterinary drugs are a type of chemical hazard in foods of animal origin. Many of these substances are evaluated for their potency of human health impacts in case they remain in foods. The approval of veterinary drugs used in food-producing animals can be made after systemic evaluation of efficacy, target animal safety, human health risk, and environmental impacts. From the viewpoint of risk management, maximum residue limits (MRLs) are regarded as a monitoring tool for compliance to the approved conditions of use, and the ADI level is a decision point for human health impacts.\nRisk assessments of veterinary drugs consist of assessing their toxicological and microbiological impacts and identifying acceptable consumption levels that the compounds should not exceed. Toxicological impact implies any biological adverse effects caused by direct intake of veterinary drugs, such as body weight change, immune suppression, and various disorders of normal body function. For microbiological impact, the targets of the ingested veterinary drugs are human intestinal microflora rather than the human body. Human intestinal microflora play important roles in the maintenance of human health. Major functions...[Content truncated]",
