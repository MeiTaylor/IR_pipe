Several studies observed that the pet food characteristics, the sources from which the owners receive dietary recommendation, and the relationship between owners and their pets can influence the choice of food they will buy [4–6]. The difficulty in understanding labels can also influence this decision, since many owners do not understand ingredient description as well as the presence of preservatives and may opt for foods that do not contain these ingredients [2,7].\nFood additives are ingredients added intentionally in diets with the aim of modifying the physical, chemical, biological, or sensory characteristics during the process of manufacturing a food [8]. Additives can be dyes, emulsifiers, or antioxidants, both natural such as tocopherols, or synthetic such as butylhydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) [9]. Without these additives, there can be alterations in the food characteristics and, consequently, alterations in the nutritional value, including oxidation of fatty acids [9]. Despite the effect in food preservation, many owners are concerned about preservatives with allegations of toxicity or even carcinogenesis [2,10].\nAccording to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the information alone does not produce or change behavior unless there is a change in the subject’s attitude [11]. TPB proposes that behaviors can be predicted by: (a) attitudes; (b) subjective norms, which are how much the subject believes that others influence the behavior; (c) and perceived behavioral control, which is the perception of the subject over the ability to execute the behavior [11]. Few studies evaluated the beliefs of dog owners, and most of them show descriptive or quantitative results [4,10]. Therefore, behavioral analysis according to the TPB can bring important information to the pet food industry and professionals on how to approach some themes with pet owners [12].\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the applicability of TPB and its ability to predict dog owner behavior, as well as evaluate the difference in owner eating habits and the habits they impose on their dogs regarding foods with or without preservatives.\nFor this prospective study a questionnaire was elaborated containing two sets of questions: a first set with 16 questions related to the owners and dog characteristics; and a second set with 38 affirmations regarding direct and indirect measures for the TPB analysis. A pilot questionnaire was first applied and a convenience sample of 6 individuals was used to obtain feedback to elaborate the final version of the questionnaire.

AFCs and benzoates in animal models have neurotoxic properties through gut microbial generation of toxic metabolites. Observational studies show associations between high emulsifier intake and cardiovascular disease. Animal models and in vitro studies have highlighted neurotoxic, cytotoxic, genotoxic and carcinogenic effects. High intake of non-caloric sweeteners has been linked to cardiovascular disease and depression in adults and is linked to childhood obesity.Little research has focused on children who are the largest consumers of UPFs. Potentially, they are a ticking time bomb for adult obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, mental health disorders and cancers. Based on risk/benefit analysis, azo dye AFCs should be banned. Benzoates, emulsifiers and sweeteners require assessment of quantitative limits and cumulative effects of combinations.

These toxins are not harmful to the organisms themselves but they may be toxic to other creatures, including humans, when eaten. These chemical compounds have diverse structures and differ in biological function and toxicity.\nSome toxins are produced by plants as a natural defense mechanism against predators, insects or microorganisms, or as consequence of infestation with microorganisms, such as mould, in response to climate stress (such as drought or extreme humidity).\nOther sources of natural toxins are microscopic algae and plankton in oceans or sometimes in lakes that produce chemical compounds that are toxic to humans but not to fish or shellfish that eat these toxin-producing organisms. When people eat fish or shellfish that contain these toxins, illness can rapidly follow.\nSome of the most commonly found natural toxins that can pose a risk to our health are described below.\n**Aquatic biotoxins**\n---------------------\nToxins formed by algae in the ocean and fresh water are called algal toxins. Algal toxins are generated during blooms of particular naturally occurring algal species. Shellfish such as mussels, scallops and oysters are more likely to contain these toxins than fish. Algal toxins can cause diarrhea, vomiting, tingling, paralysis and other effects in humans, other mammals or fish. The algal toxins can be retained in shellfish and fish or contaminate drinking water. They have no taste or smell, and are not eliminated by cooking or freezing.\nAnother example is ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) which is caused by consuming fish contaminated with dinoflagellates that produce ciguatoxins. Some fish known to harbour ciguatoxins include barracuda, black grouper, dog snapper, and king mackerel. Symptoms of ciguatera poisoning include nausea, vomiting, and neurologic symptoms, such as tingling sensation on fingers and toes. There is currently no specific treatment for ciguatera poisoning.\n**Cyanogenic glycosides**\n-------------------------\nCyanogenic glycosides are phytoto...[Content truncated]",

            "content": "Sodium benzoate is used as a preservative to prevent food from molding. It's added to a wide variety of foods, including mayonnaise, margarine, carbonated drinks, jams and jellies, sauces, and tomato paste.\nIt helps keep products shelf-stable for at least 2 years from the date of purchase and is used in concentrations of less than 0.5% by volume.\nIt's used in other household products, too, including mouthwash, lotion, and as a preservative in some medicines.\n According to the FDA, you'd need exposure to about 180 times the amount of sodium benzoate an average person gets before you'd have health problems. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSodium benzoate is used as a preservative in soft drinks, among other products. After a scare about benzene – a cancer-causing chemical – in drinks, the FDA tested drinks and worked with manufacturers to change formulas if needed. (Photo Credit: iStock)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSodium benzoate is considered safe, but scientists have shown that negative side effects happen when it's mixed with ascorbic acid (vitamin C). \nTheir studies show that it turns into benzene, a chemical that may cause cancer. Benzene occurs naturally and also results from human activities. Forest fires and volcanoes produce benzene. It's in gasoline and cigarette smoke. \nYou can be exposed to benzene from car exhaust, and emissions from gas stations and factories. At home, benzene might come from detergents, paint, glue, or furniture wax. \nIn the 1990s, the FDA learned that benzene was present in some soft drinks. Some drink makers used sodium benzoate and ascorbic acid in their formulas. Starting in 2005, the FDA tested more than 200 soft drinks for benzene. Benzene above what's considered a safe level was found in ...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What do independent studies say about the long-term health effects of BHA and other preservatives in dog treats?",
        "Answer": "Independent studies have raised concerns about the long-term health effects of BHA (Butylated Hydroxyanisole) and other preservatives used in dog treats. Here is a summary of key findings:\n\n1. **Cancer Risk**: Multiple studies have linked BHA to cancer and reproductive disorders. The National Toxicology Program has identified BHA as a chemical \"reasonably anticipated\" to be a cancer-causing substance in humans, indicating significant potential risks associated with its use in both human and animal food products [Query 1_evidence_1]. Laboratory studies have shown that BHA can produce malignant tumors in animals, which raises concerns about its safety in dog treats, especially since dogs typically consume the same food continuously, increasing their exposure [Query 1_evidence_1].\n\n2. **Banned in Other Countries**: The European Union has classified BHA as a ‘hormone disruptor,’ leading to its ban in certain food products due to evidence that it can damage reproductive health in laboratory animals [Query 1_evidence_1]. This adds to the apprehension regarding its use in pet foods, including dog treats.\n\n3. **Sodium Benzoate Concerns**: Sodium benzoate, another common preservative, has been found to pose risks, particularly when mixed with ascorbic acid (vitamin C), as this combination can produce benzene, a known carcinogen. Although sodium benzoate is generally regarded as safe at low concentrations, its interaction with certain other ingredients raises questions about its long-term safety in pet foods [Query 2_evidence_2].\n\n4. **General Warnings About Food Additives**: Broader studies have suggested that many artificial food additives, such as synthetic colorants and preservatives, can contribute to various health issues, including increased risks of mental health disorders, obesity, and other chronic diseases. While specific studies focusing on dog foods are limited, analogous findings from human food studies highlight the potential health risks associated with long-term exposure to these additives [Query 2_evidence_1].\n\nIn conclusion, independent studies suggest that both BHA and sodium benzoate pose potential long-term health risks in dog treats, with evidence linking BHA to cancer and reproductive issues and concerns surrounding other preservatives. It is advised that pet owners consider these factors when choosing foods for their dogs.",
