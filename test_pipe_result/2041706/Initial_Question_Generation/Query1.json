We then expanded our efforts across the country — hiring 27 staff members on the ground nationwide — to rally support ahead of a full Senate vote. After tens of thousands of letters, emails and calls from our members and supporters, victory was achieved and DADT was repealed in full on September 20, 2011. Service members previously discharged for their LGBTQ+ status were offered re-enrollment and future recruits knew they would no longer face discrimination when trying to serve their country.\n!(blob:https://www.hrc.org/9d7a2d316567be8aa73aaa8ee2b1ed5b)\nBarack-Obama-repeals-Dont-Ask-Dont-Tell\nThe Continued Fight for Transgender Rights\n------------------------------------------\nIn July 2017, President Trump sent a hateful tweet that transgender individuals would no longer be able to enter the military and those currently enlisted would not be allowed to continue in their roles. This was followed by an official memorandum the next month that went into effect in January 2019 amid ongoing lawsuits. Since then, HRC has joined a  fighting back against the policy. Trump’s ban is baseless, spurious and flat out unpatriotic. HRC is continuing to fight against this ban so that all people — especially transgender individuals — can serve our country.\n Play the Video: Transgender Service Members Speak Out]\nTransgender service members speak out against the Trump-Pence administration's discriminatory trans military ban.",

The officer then retreated down the ladder, and the gunman quickly fired toward Trump, the officials said. That's when U.S. Secret Service gunmen shot him, the officials said.\nQuestions abounded about how the gunman could have gotten so close in the first place. Kevin Rojek, the agent in charge of the FBI’s Pittsburgh field office, said \"it is surprising” that the gunman was able to open fire on the stage before the Secret Service killed him.\nBomb-making materials were found inside both Crooks' vehicle and at his home. The FBI described the devices as “rudimentary.\"\nHis motive remained unclear. Crooks wasn't on the FBI's radar, and he was believed to have acted alone. Investigators combed through his social media feeds and his home but found no immediate threatening writing or posts. His family was cooperating. Crooks’ relatives did not return multiple messages seeking comment from the AP.\nCrooks’ political leanings were also not clear. Records show Crooks was registered as a Republican voter in Pennsylvania, but federal campaign finance reports also show he gave $15 to a progressive political action committee on Jan. 20, 2021, the day Biden was sworn in as president.\nThe absence of a clear ideological motive added to the deepening questions about the shooting, denying the public any swift or tidy conclusions about the shocking crime.\nBiden urged Americans to stay patient. “I urge everyone — everyone, please, don’t make assumptions about his motives or his affiliations,\" he said.\n#### Most serious assassination attempt since 1981\nThe attack was the most serious attempt to kill a president or presidential candidate since  in 1981. It drew new attention to concerns about political violence in a deeply polarized U.S. less than four months before the presidential election.\nFBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate said agents have seen increasingly violent rhetoric online since the rally, along with people posing online as the dead shooter.\n“We’re also focused on the continuing efforts — which were already substantial, given that they’re national security special events — to conventions in Chicago, in Milwaukee,” he said.\nBiden on Sunday ordered a security review of operations for the Republican National Convention...[Content truncated]",

Mark Milley.\nThe 73-year-old Kelly told CNN that Trump is “a person that thinks those who defend their country in uniform, or are shot down or seriously wounded in combat, or spend years being tortured as POWs are all ‘suckers’ because ‘there is nothing in it for them.’”\nHe also said that Trump did not want to be photographed in public with military amputees, with the former president reportedly saying, “it doesn’t look good for me.”\nReports of Trump skipping out on military cemetery visits, banning wounded troops from official White House events and mocking prisoners of war and troops killed in action have circulated for years, but not with any confirmation from an official as high ranking in Trump’s inner circles as Kelly.\nWith Trump vying for a return to the White House next year, Kelly called him “a person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law.”\nThe news comes less than two weeks after Trump took to social media to attack Milley, who retired from the military this weekend, for speaking to Chinese authorities in the tumultuous days following the 2020 presidential election.\nMilley has said the conversations were routine interactions to keep lines of communications open during a presidential transition.

Reyes also is scheduled to sentence co-defendants Micah Coomer on Tuesday and Joshua Abate on Wednesday.\nThe three Marines — friends from the same unit — drove together from a military post in Virginia to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, when  spoke at his “Stop the Steal” rally near the White House. They joined the crowd that stormed the Capitol after Trump urged his supporters to “fight like hell.”\nBefore imposing Hellonen’s sentence, Reyes described how Marines fought and died in some of the fiercest battles in American history. She recited the number of casualties from some of the bloodiest wars.\nProsecutors recommended short terms of incarceration — 30 days for Coomer and 21 days for Hellonen and Abate — along with 60 hours of community service.\n that their military service, while laudable, makes their conduct “all the more troubling.”\nReyes said she agreed with prosecutors that Hellonen’s status as an active-duty Marine does not weigh in favor of a more lenient sentence. But she ultimately decided to spare him from a prison term, sentencing him to four years of probation.\nReyes said it “carried a great deal of weight” to learn that Hellonen maintained a positive attitude and stellar work ethic when he was effectively demoted after the Jan. 6 attack. He went from working as a signals analyst to a job that few Marines want, inventorying military gear.\n“The only person who can give you a second chance is yourself,” she told him.\n“I take full responsibility for my actions and I’ll carry this with me for the rest of my life,” Hellonen told the judge.\nHellonen, Coomer and Abate pleaded guilty earlier this year to parading, demonstrating or picketing in a...[Content truncated]",

Trump ordered his supporters to get her out of the room, and she said people yelled racial slurs and profanities at her as they shoved her out.\nShe told WFPL, Louisville's NPR News Station, that she filed a police report on the incident.\nThe racially charged video spread quickly and sparked outrage, particularly in the wake of Trump, two days before, declining to disavow an endorsement from Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.\nMatthew Heimbach, who leads a white separatist group called Traditional Youth Network, wrote on his blog that he was involved in the shoving incident. He is seen in the video wearing a red hat.\nHe said Nwanguma, the protester, had been disruptive. His group also posted Friday an argument that violence is part of public discourse.\n\"It won't be me next time,\" Heimbach wrote, \"but White Americans are getting fed up and they're learning that they must either push back or be pushed down.\"\nHeimbach and his group have  during the rally in at least two criminal complaints filed last week, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported.\nIn January, Heimbach trained for three weeks to become a family case manager in Dubois County for the Indiana Department of Child Services, according to the state personnel department. He was terminated Jan. 29 \"for inability to successfully complete the working...[Content truncated]",

CNN reports he was accused of using someone else's social security number, and \"writing bad cheques\".\nHis family was reportedly unaware of these events.\nMr Whelan continued to work for Kelly Services, and was promoted to senior manager of global security and investigations in 2010.\nAccording to court documents, he was in charge of the company's campus security group, and his duties included managing and conducting investigations, as well as handling some purchasing.\nHe left the company in 2016, moving to become director of global security for US-based automotive components supplier BorgWarner.\nMr Whelan was \"responsible for overseeing security\" at facilities in Michigan and around the world, a company statement said. The company does not have any facilities in Russia, but the former Marine often travelled there.\nSince his first visit in 2006, Mr Whelan made a number of other trips to Russia and developed an in-depth knowledge of the country.\nIt was due to his knowledge of Russia that he had been asked to attend the wedding of a fellow former Marine in Moscow in December 2018...[Content truncated]",
