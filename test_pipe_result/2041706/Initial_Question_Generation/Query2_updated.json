In the cafeteria, I\u2019d sit down with him and I\u2019d say, \u2018Thomas, would you like me to get some kids over here?\u2019 And he\u2019d say, \u2018Nope, Mr. Knapp, I want to be by myself.\u2019 Which is fine,\u201d Knapp said.\nKnapp said counselors at the high school met with students twice a year to go over class schedules, assist those who needed help and address any issues they were having at school.\nKnapp said he never got a call from a teacher about Crooks\u2019 getting into trouble or not doing his homework.\nShow more\n\u201cThomas was a very good student. He wasn\u2019t in trouble. So I didn\u2019t get those calls,\u201d Knapp said.\nKnapp said he was shocked when he learned Crooks was the shooter.\n\u201cWhen I got the first text on Sunday \u2026 I was flabbergasted,\u201d Knapp said. \u201cI go back and I think about it, and I say evil is in the world, and that\u2019s what I believe happened with Thomas. He snapped.

He also pushed to bring military tanks to the site of his planned speech at the Lincoln Memorial, prompting National Park Service officials to warn that such a deployment could damage the site, these individuals said.\nEngineers were examining the site this week to determine if the weight of stationing armored vehicles there would affect the Lincoln Memorial\u2019s underground rooms, according to one individual briefed on the efforts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.\nTrump told reporters late Monday that \u201cwe\u2019re going to have some tanks stationed outside,\u201d following a report about the emerging plans by The Washington Post. He cast the spectacle as part of a Fourth of July \u201clike no other. It\u2019ll be special.\u201d\nBut the use of such massive military hardware for Thursday\u2019s celebration sparked sharp criticism from D.C. officials, Democratic lawmakers and advocates of the Park Service, who noted the agency already faces a maintenance backlog of more than $11\u00a0billion.\nThe event also will freeze air traffic to and from Reagan National Airport for more than two hours Thursday, from 6:15\u00a0p.m. to 7:45\u00a0p.m., for the flyover of military jets and again, from 9\u00a0p.m....[Content truncated]",
