                "content": "\n\n\n\nBernard  Sanders (born September 8, 1941) is an American politician and activist who is the senior United States senator from Vermont. Sanders is the longest-serving independent in U.S. congressional history but has a close relationship with the Democratic Party, having caucused with House and Senate Democrats for most of his congressional career and sought the party's presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020, coming second in both campaigns. He is often seen as the leader of the U.S. progressive movement.\n\nBorn into a working-class Jewish family and raised in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, Sanders attended Brooklyn College before graduating from the University of Chicago in 1964. While a student, he was a protest organizer for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) during the civil rights movement. After settling in Vermont in 1968, he ran unsuccessful third-party political campaigns in the early to mid-1970s. He was elected mayor of Burlington in 1981 as an independent and was reelected three times. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990, representing Vermont's at-large congressional district, later co-founding the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He was a U.S. representative for 16 years before being elected to the U.S. Senate in...[Content truncated]",

                "content": "[Content truncated]... 2016 election, I sent the email above to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg. It was the text for an op-ed I was planning to publish about problems I was seeing on Facebook. Earlier in the year, I noticed a surge of disturbing images, shared by friends, that originated on Facebook Groups ostensibly associated with the Bernie Sanders campaign, but it was impossible to imagine they came from his campaign. I wanted to share with Sandberg and Zuckerberg my fear that bad actors were exploiting Facebook’s architecture and business model to inflict harm on innocent people.\nI am a longtime tech investor and evangelist. Tech has been my career and my passion. I had been an early adviser to Zuckerberg–Zuck, to many colleagues and friends–and an early investor in Facebook. I had been a true believer for a decade. My early meetings with Zuck almost always occurred in his office, generally just the two of us, so I had an incomplete picture of the man, but he was always straight with me. I liked Zuck. I liked his team. I was a fan of Facebook. I was one of the people he would call on when confronted with new or challenging issues. Mentoring is fun for me, and Zuck could not have been a better mentee. We talked about stuff that was important to Zuck, where I had useful experience. More often than not, he acted on my counsel.\nWhen I sent that email to Zuck and Sheryl, I assumed that Facebook was a victim. What I learned in the months that followed–about the 2016 election, about the spread of Brexit lies, about data on users being sold to other groups–shocked and disappointed me. It took me a very long time to accept that success had blinded Zuck and Sheryl to the consequences of their actions. I have never had a reason to bite Facebook’s hand. Even at this writing, I still own shares in Facebook. My criticism of the company is a matter of principle, and owning shares is a good way to make that point. I became an activist because I was among the first to see a catastrophe unfolding, and my history with the company made me a credible voice.\nThis is a story of my journey. It is a story about power. About privilege. About trust, and how it can be abused.\nThe massive success of Facebook eventually led to catastrophe. The business model depends on advertising, which in turn depends on manipulating the attention of users so they see more ads. One of the best ways to manipulate...[Content truncated]",

Albany, she made her name as an adult in some of the most politically powerful metropolitan areas in the country: in Boston and Washington, places that were a world apart from the Grand Union in Plattsburgh.\nThe North Country is more rural, and less diverse, than much of the United States. But it is emblematic of one of the most disconcerting, least-discussed aspects of our national political life: America is experiencing a political crisis rooted partly in the concept of place. Our political elite in both parties are disproportionately connected to a few neighborhoods in a few metropolitan areas that are distant and different from the places they are supposed to understand and govern. For too many of these people, the road to political influence involves effectively defecting from the places they know to the places where there are people it is important to know. That leaves many places in our country governed by strangers rather than neighbors — with disastrous consequences for American democracy.\n!\nWe are and always have been a country defined — and divided — by place. James Madison wrote more than 200 years ago in the Federalist Papers that the United States would be a “large ... republic” composed of political communities sorted by geography.\nFor a long time, place shaped people’s lives in part because it was so hard to get anyone or anything to other places. Madison gave a speech during the first Congress worrying that political leaders would need “liberal compensations” to incentivize them to travel great distances. When the capital of the young country moved to Washington, and Congress met for the first time there in 1800, members endured difficult travel conditions. The roads were so bad at the time that, as Fergus M. Bordewich  in “Washington: The Making of the American Capital,” “it was customary for drivers to call to their passengers to act as ballast by first leaning to one side and then to the other, to keep the coach from overturning.” The mail situation wasn’t much better: In some parts of the country, deliveries or collections could be spaced a week apart.\nFor the most privileged Americans, the power of place, while very real, has become harder to see — because their places change more significantly and more frequently.\nAdvances in technology and transportation have obviously changed these dynamics, expanding the number of weak ties that people can have over long distances. But place still matters a lot — more than you might think — in defining who many Americans are. In the average county weighted by population, according to a  from the Journal of Economic Perspectives, 55 percent of Facebook friends live within 50 miles of one another, even though only...[Content truncated]",

He did not believe it was possible a one-month supply of “life-saving” medication could cost so much.\nThe price tag was correct.\nSego, then a student and football player at DePauw University, began to ration his insulin, using a quarter of what had been prescribed. He lost weight. His grades dropped. He struggled on the field.\nFortunately, his mother found out and stopped him from limiting his insulin intake – a practice that is increasingly common and potentially deadly.\nOn Sunday, Sego and his mother, Kathy, drove seven hours from Indiana to join a caravan of roughly a dozen patients with type 1 diabetes on a bus to Canada with Bernie Sanders. The Americans – wearing glucose monitors on their arms and shirts that said “diabetic” – set out to buy insulin for a fraction of its cost at home.\nSanders’ northern sojourn, a trip his campaign sponsored, was designed to highlight the rising cost of prescription drugs in the US, which the senator said was the result of “incredible corruption and greed” on the part of the US pharmaceutical industry.\n“How does it happen 10 minutes away from the American border in Michigan, people here...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What examples exist of Bernie Sanders' travel experiences in coach that highlight his campaign's budget-friendly approach?",
        "Answer": "Bernie Sanders' travel experiences in coach during his presidential campaign reflect his commitment to a budget-friendly approach, highlighting his focus on cost-effectiveness. Several examples support this assertion:\n\n1. **Consistent Coach Travel**: An article in The New York Times from October 1, 2015, explicitly states that \"Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont still flies coach to his campaign events, sometimes taking the middle seat.\" This illustrates his willingness to travel economically, standing in contrast to many other candidates who may prioritize luxury [Query2_evidence_1].\n\n2. **Frequent Appearances on Commercial Airlines**: A CNN article dated December 29, 2015, reported that Sanders is frequently seen on commercial airlines. The piece notes he is \"most likely to pop up in your feed before his boarding call\" in coach, reinforcing the image of Sanders being a candidate dedicated to connecting with the general public through his travel choices rather than opting for private or first-class flights typical of many political figures [Query2_evidence_2].\n\n3. **Highlighting the Issue of Prescription Drug Costs**: In a separate campaign event, Sanders joined a caravan with Americans traveling to Canada for affordable insulin. This trip not only showcases his engagements in budget-conscious planning (by sponsoring a bus trip) but also emphasizes the broader narrative of fighting against corporate greed and advocating for people through direct, relatable actions. While this event may not directly relate to flying coach, it illustrates his approach of prioritizing cost-conscious strategies in his public engagements, echoing the ethos behind his travel choices [Query2_evidence_3].\n\nGiven these examples, the evidence strongly supports the understanding that Sanders utilized coach travel to align his actions with the campaign’s budget-friendly message.",
