When we have confirmed access, the full article content will load.\nMaureen Dowd\n!\nSenator Bernie Sanders heading back to his office after breakfast in Burlington, Vt.Credit...Ian Thomas Jansen-Lonnquist for The New York Times\nBURLINGTON, Vt. \u2014 I want to talk to Bernie about Balenciaga. And Britney. And Dua Lipa, Sha\u2019Carri Richardson and Joe Manchin\u2019s . And whether he prefers red or white horseradish on his gefilte fish. And the state of capitalism, and the absurd price of a Birkin bag.\nWe settle into a retro yellow booth at Henry\u2019s Diner and I pull out a thick sheaf of questions. Eyeing it suspiciously, he asks with that booming Brooklyn accent, \u201cYou givin\u2019 a speech?\u201d\nHe reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls out his own piece of paper, a list of items written in his loopy scrawl. These are the _only_ things he\u2019s here to talk about.\nAt 79, Bernie Sanders is a man on a mission, laser-focused on a list that represents trillions of dollars in government spending that he deems essential. When I stray into other subjects, the senator jabs his finger at his piece of paper or waves it in my face, like Van Helsing warding off Dracula with a cross.\n\u201cMaureen, let me just tell you what we\u2019re trying to do here,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re working on what I think is the most consequential piece of legislation for working families since the 1930s.\u201d\nSanders, long a wilderness prophet in Washington, a man who wrote a  bragging about being an outsider, admits that it is strange to be a key member of The Establishment. As the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, the  is now pulling the levers in the control room.\n* * *\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

We both lived in Vermont, where I was one of his constituents, but I never voted for him because I thought then, as I do now, that he\u2019s a fundamentally unserious person whose far-left politics are ridiculous.\nBut it turns out we\u2019ve both been to the Soviet Union. In fact, as a scholar of Soviet and Russian affairs, I visited the USSR and later the new Russia several times. (I even speak Russian, although I\u2019m a bit rusty.) Now I find that I face the unwelcome possibility that for the first time I might have to vote for Sanders \u2014 for president, no less.\nAs a Soviet expert and a politically homeless Never Trump voter, I am certain of three things when it comes to Bernie and the Soviets. First, his comments about the USSR show that his judgment is terrible. Second, he will be unable to wave away his comments merely by appending \u201cdemocratic\u201d to his preferred version of Soviet\u00a0ideology.\nAnd third, the Republicans will weaponize his remarks, and this will likely cost him the election. Indeed, it would be professional malpractice if Trump\u2019s campaign people passed up this chance. Were I still a Republican and hoping for a GOP win, I could write those ads myself.\nSanders sounded bamboozled\n--------------------------\nFirst, some context. Sanders visited Yaroslavl\u00a0and other cities \u2014 another coincidence, since that is a city I\u2019ve visited as well \u2014 in 1988, when the Cold War was nearly over. By that point,  for three years\u00a0and had welcomed Ronald Reagan to Moscow after they both had signed a landmark nuclear arms treaty.\nStill, Sanders came back sounding like he had\u00a0been bamboozled, like so many other credulous Westerners who visited the USSR and took what they were shown by their hosts at face value. Some of the juicier quotes,\u00a0like the wince-inducing ,\u00a0are already floating around on social media.\n!\nHere's an\u00a0example that has gone less noticed. It\u2019s about health care, a subject vital to the Democrats.\nSanders was amazed at the open \u201c\u201d of his Soviet hosts, who admitted that the USSR was 10 or 15 years behind America in medical technology. This seems quite candid, if you didn\u2019t know a thing about the Soviet Union. In reality, it was a perfect example of the sophisticated...[Content truncated]",

There is absolutely no place for political violence in our country, and we must all condemn it at every turn.\nIn the coming weeks, as the nation recovers from this shocking and tragic event, we must not lose sight of the incredibly high stakes of the November election, and the millions of working Americans whose access to affordable health care, decent wages, and a habitable planet is on the line.\nI will do all that I can to see that President Biden is re-elected. Why? Despite my disagreements with him on particular issues, he has been the most effective president in the modern history of our country and is the strongest candidate to defeat Mr. Trump \u2014 a demagogue and pathological liar. It\u2019s time to learn a lesson from the progressive and centrist forces in France who, despite profound political differences, came together this week to soundly defeat right-wing extremism.\nI strongly disagree with Mr. Biden on the question of U.S. support for Israel\u2019s horrific war against the Palestinian people. The United States should not provide Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing extremist government with another nickel as it continues to create one of the worst humanitarian disasters in modern history.\nI strongly disagree with the president\u2019s belief that the Affordable Care Act, as useful as it has been, will ever address America\u2019s health care crisis. Our health care system is broken, dysfunctional and wildly expensive and needs to be replaced with a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d single-payer system. Health care is a human right.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

As Vox\u2019s Ezra Klein , Sanders ran for office believing that President Obama\u2019s core failure was in surrendering the \u201coutside game\u201d \u2014 that Democrats had to learn to take their message far beyond Capitol Hill for it to impact Washington.\n\u201cThe major political, strategic difference I have with Obama,\u201d Sanders , \u201cis it\u2019s too late to do anything inside the Beltway. You gotta take your case to the American people, mobilize them, and organize them at the grassroots level in a way that we have never done before.\u201d\nSanders is now determined to transform his movement campaign to save Obamacare into one to pressure Democrats to embrace Medicare-for-all. On Wednesday, the Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino  that Sanders had started a six-figure digital advertising campaign on Facebook and Google to generate public \u201cco-sponsors\u201d of his single-payer bill. He\u2019s sent a message to supporters asking for ideas about the plan, and is expected to soon hold rallies to push explicitly for Medicare-for-all.\nPrivately, Senate Democratic staffers were thankful that Sanders brought the \u201coutside game\u201d to Obamacare\u2019s defense. But when he does so this September, it may not be as much to national Democrats\u2019 liking.\n\u201cWhat you saw was a rising up of the American people,\u201d Sanders  Chris Hayes after Republicans failed to pass their bill. \u201cThat\u2019s why it was a victory.\u201d",
