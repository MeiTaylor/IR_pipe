It was the text for an op-ed I was planning to publish about problems I was seeing on Facebook. Earlier in the year, I noticed a surge of disturbing images, shared by friends, that originated on Facebook Groups ostensibly associated with the Bernie Sanders campaign, but it was impossible to imagine they came from his campaign. I wanted to share with Sandberg and Zuckerberg my fear that bad actors were exploiting Facebook’s architecture and business model to inflict harm on innocent people.\nI am a longtime tech investor and evangelist. Tech has been my career and my passion. I had been an early adviser to Zuckerberg–Zuck, to many colleagues and friends–and an early investor in Facebook. I had been a true believer for a decade. My early meetings with Zuck almost always occurred in his office, generally just the two of us, so I had an incomplete picture of the man, but he was always straight with me. I liked Zuck. I liked his team. I was a fan of Facebook. I was one of the people he would call on when confronted with new or challenging issues. Mentoring is fun for me, and Zuck could not have been a better mentee. We talked about stuff that was important to Zuck, where I had useful experience. More often than not, he acted on my counsel.\nWhen I sent that email to Zuck and Sheryl, I assumed that Facebook was a victim. What I learned in the months that followed–about the 2016 election, about the spread of Brexit lies, about data on users being sold to other groups–shocked and disappointed me. It took me a very long time to accept that success had blinded Zuck and Sheryl to the consequences of their actions. I have never had a reason to bite Facebook’s hand. Even at this writing, I still own shares in Facebook. My criticism of the company is a matter of principle, and owning shares is a good way to make that point. I became an activist because I was among the first to see a catastrophe unfolding, and my history with the company made me a credible voice.\nThis is a story of my journey. It is a story about power. About privilege. About trust, and how it can be abused.\nThe massive success of Facebook eventually led to catastrophe. The business model depends on advertising, which in turn depends on manipulating the attention of users so they see more ads. One of the best ways to manipulate...[Content truncated]",

Albany, she made her name as an adult in some of the most politically powerful metropolitan areas in the country: in Boston and Washington, places that were a world apart from the Grand Union in Plattsburgh.\nThe North Country is more rural, and less diverse, than much of the United States. But it is emblematic of one of the most disconcerting, least-discussed aspects of our national political life: America is experiencing a political crisis rooted partly in the concept of place. Our political elite in both parties are disproportionately connected to a few neighborhoods in a few metropolitan areas that are distant and different from the places they are supposed to understand and govern. For too many of these people, the road to political influence involves effectively defecting from the places they know to the places where there are people it is important to know. That leaves many places in our country governed by strangers rather than neighbors — with disastrous consequences for American democracy.\n!\nWe are and always have been a country defined — and divided — by place. James Madison wrote more than 200 years ago in the Federalist Papers that the United States would be a “large ... republic” composed of political communities sorted by geography.\nFor a long time, place shaped people’s lives in part because it was so hard to get anyone or anything to other places. Madison gave a speech during the first Congress worrying that political leaders would need “liberal compensations” to incentivize them to travel great distances. When the capital of the young country moved to Washington, and Congress met for the first time there in 1800, members endured difficult travel conditions. The roads were so bad at the time that, as Fergus M. Bordewich  in “Washington: The Making of the American Capital,” “it was customary for drivers to call to their passengers to act as ballast by first leaning to one side and then to the other, to keep the coach from overturning.” The mail situation wasn’t much better: In some parts of the country, deliveries or collections could be spaced a week apart.\nFor the most privileged Americans, the power of place, while very real, has become harder to see — because their places change more significantly and more frequently.\nAdvances in technology and transportation have obviously changed these dynamics, expanding the number of weak ties that people can have over long distances. But place still matters a lot — more than you might think — in defining who many Americans are. In the average county weighted by population, according to a  from the Journal of Economic Perspectives, 55 percent of Facebook friends live within 50 miles of one another, even though only...[Content truncated]",

Sanders is the longest-serving independent in U.S. congressional history but has a close relationship with the Democratic Party, having caucused with House and Senate Democrats for most of his congressional career and sought the party's presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020, coming second in both campaigns. He is often seen as the leader of the U.S. progressive movement.\n\nBorn into a working-class Jewish family and raised in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, Sanders attended Brooklyn College before graduating from the University of Chicago in 1964. While a student, he was a protest organizer for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) during the civil rights movement. After settling in Vermont in 1968, he ran unsuccessful third-party political campaigns in the early to mid-1970s. He was elected mayor of Burlington in 1981 as an independent and was reelected three times. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990, representing Vermont's at-large congressional district, later co-founding the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

It is an economic theory first, and it is a part of a governing system. It is a cooperative system where people, like you and me are the owners of the business we work at, and to a larger extent, we own all the businesses equally. There are verying degrees to which this can be put into practice. You van have individual businesses that are co-ops in competition with each other with profits distributed evenly (or through some tiered system based on position or seniority or whatever). This still holds on to a certain level of capitalism and is the least \"socialist\" form of socialism. Or, you can have businesses that remit all profit to a central agency to redistribute it similarly to the first example, but at the national level. Finally there is communism. There is no money, people produce based on a quota system, and goods and services are provided as needed through the cetralized agency. Usually, that central agency is the government, but it need not be.\nAll that other garbage people call socialism, really isn't socialism. It is anything from welfarism to state capitalism. Democratic socialism was once referred to as Nordic Capitalism. But for what ever reason, the words welfare and capitalism were a turn off, so the adopted a new name.\nSo, here we are. Is Bernie a socialist? He might be. He loves co-ops and other businesses that use other forms of self ownership and profit sharing. He loves big centralized, government controlled programs, which is a hallmark of socialism, (but it's really state capitalism until it is no longer subsidized by taxes and is part of the third example.) But, you are asking the wrong question young Padawan.\nAre his policies socialist? No. Every program he's pushing is either state capitalism or welfarism. Universal state provided healthcare? State capitalism. We are paying collectively for a service through our tax money. It's no different than private services except you have no choice but to pay for it. Same with tuition free college. $15 non negotiated minimum wage? Welfarism. Expansion of social security, kind of a weird mix between the two. The list goes on.\nSo there you have it. Bernie may be, and probably is, a genuine Socialist deep down in his heart. He probably looks at factories and has the Russian national anthem (which does sound awesome) playing in his head...[Content truncated]",

Of course, size matters.  Some students are looking for a large university in an urban setting where the city itself plays an important role in one’s education. New York and Boston, for example, have become increasingly popular college destinations, but not, I suspect, for the classroom experience. But if one seeks small classes and strong, personal relationships with faculty, then liberal arts schools, which pride themselves on providing rich cultural and social experiences on a residential campus, are especially compelling. You can be on a campus with a human scale and still have plenty of things to do. Wesleyan is somewhat larger than most liberal arts colleges but much smaller than the urban or land grant universities. We feel that this gives our students the opportunity to choose a broad curriculum and a variety of cultural activities on campus, while still being small enough to encourage regular, sustained relationships among faculty and students.\nAll the selective small liberal arts schools boast of having a faculty of scholar-teachers, of a commitment to research and interdisciplinarity, and of encouraging community and service. So what sets us apart from one another after taking into account size, location, and financial aid packages? What are students trying to see when they visit Amherst and Wesleyan, or Tufts and Pomona?\nAs students scan the Wesleyan website, go to chatrooms and listen to current students talk about their experiences, I hope our they feel the brave exuberance and ambition of our students, the intelligence and care of our faculty, the playful yet demanding qualities of our community. I would like prospective students to get a sense our commitment to creating a diversity in which difference is embraced and not just tolerated, and to public service that is part of one’s education and approach to life. Our students have the courage to find new combinations of subjects to study, of people to meet, of challenges to face.\nWhatever college or university students choose, I hope they get three things out of their education: discovering what they love to do; getting better at it; learning to share it with others. I explain a little bit more about that in this talk to admitted students a few years ago:\n\nWe all know that Wesleyan is hard to get into, but even in the group of highly selective schools, Wes is not for...[Content truncated]",

Sanders, like many progressives, is deeply skeptical of American involvement in the politics South of our border where our national policies have been interventionist and destructive as one can see in Nicaragua, Guatemala, Chile, and Cuba. Current interventions in Venezuela are led by a pardoned felon and unidicted war criminal, Elliot Abrams, which cannot be good for anything. You will see agitation against American intervention in Venezuela but that doesn't mean an endorsement of their government or economic polices as much as a cautionary reaction to our own ham handed usually destructive actions that end up backfiring and doing more harm than good. Propping up corrupt regimes in Cuba only led to Castro after all. In another setting our undermining of Iranian democracy only led to the Ayatollahs taking over. In Venezuela today letting their neighbors take the lead to make a transition away from Maduro is sensible policy.\nThe right has been trying to tie any form of social progressivism in our country to totalitarianism for generations, completely ignoring that all of Europe from the Russian border to the Atlantic and much of our own domestic policies adhere to reasonable, well thought out social democratic ideas that place most of what Sanders actually says within the political mainstream and that was actually Republican policy in the Nixon administration. Sanders consistently brings up European social policy from places that are successful capitalist economies with free markets. His ideal of universal health care has been a relative norm in Europe since Bismarck and single payer was supported by no less a conservative figure than Sir Winston Churchill.\nThe political right is invested in straw man arguments that in terms of tax policy, health care and the role of government in the modern era add lots of emotion but scarce value. Bernie doesn't see Venezuela as an example to follow. It's slander to say otherwise.\nA broken state with generation of corruption and weak civil society will always find a demagogue who will spout either totalitarian from the left or authoritarian nonsense from the right and attack open society. That's what happened in Russia in 1918, in Spain, Italy and Germany in the thirties and in Venezuela under Chavez. Democratic socialism on the contrary is the result of and the natural development of free societies with open, democratic institutions.\nUpvote ·\n92\nRelated questions\nMore answers below\n]\nSenior Software Engineer at Amazon (company) (2009–present) · Upvoted by\n, lived in Venezuela (1997-2008)Author has 1....[Content truncated]",
