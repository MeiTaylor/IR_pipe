Most abortion patients say that they cannot afford a child or another child, and most say that having a baby would interfere with their work, school or ability to care for their other children.9 Most women also cite concern for or responsibility to other individuals as a factor in their decision to have an abortion. These concerns make particular sense when one considers that six in 10 women who have an abortion are already a parent.7\nUnfortunately, for a pregnant woman who is already struggling to get by, the cost of an abortion may be more than she can afford on her own. The average amount paid for an abortion at 10 weeks\u2019 gestation was $480 in 2011\u20132012.10 The University of California, San Francisco Turnaway Study\u2014a five-year longitudinal study of roughly 1,000 women seeking abortion care at 30 facilities across the United States\u2014found that for more than half of women who received an abortion, their out-of-pocket costs (for the procedure, as well as for travel and hotel, if needed) were equivalent to more than one-third of their monthly personal income.11\nOther studies show that many Americans do not have adequate savings to cover a financial emergency of any kind. In 2013, the Federal Reserve Board conducted a nationally representative household survey designed to \"monitor the financial and economic status of American consumers.\"12 The survey asked respondents how they would pay for a $400 emergency, and 47% said either that they would cover it by borrowing or selling something, or that they would not be able to come up with the money.\nEnter Hyde\n----------\nIn 2015, roughly 90% of Americans had health insurance coverage to help defray the costs of any medical bills.13 However, unlike most other types of health care services, abortion is highly politicized, and insurance coverage for abortion has been the target of severe restrictions.\nForty years ago, in the wake of _Roe v. Wade_, Congress passed the Hyde Amendment\u2014which bans the use of federal funds for abortion services in all but the most extreme circumstances\u2014by attaching it to the annual spending bill funding what is now the Department of Health and Human Services. From the start, antiabortion politicians have acknowledged that, without a path to ban abortion outright, they have used the power of the purse to interfere with women\u2019s decision-making around abortion. During debate over the measure, Hyde told his colleagues, \"I certainly would like to prevent, if I could legally, anybody having an abortion, a rich woman, a middle-class woman, or a poor woman.

Hodgkinson was charged with two counts of battery, aggravated discharge of a firearm, criminal damage to a motor vehicle and two counts of domestic battery. None of the three victims showed up in court, so the case was dismissed later that year.\nAnother, more recent incident, occurred three months ago. Deputies with the St. Clair Sheriff\u2019s Office were called when locals heard \u201cshots fired\u201d in a residential neighborhood, according to police records. Deputies found Hodgkinson shooting a hunting rifle. But because he had properly registered himself as a firearms owner with the state of Illinois, deputies merely advised him to shoot safely.\n\u2018Unacceptable behavior\u2019\n-----------------------\nFor a time, Hodgkinson worked as an independent subcontractor doing lead paint removal for the St. Clair County\u2019s housing rehabilitation and weatherization program, according to county board chairman Mark Kern.\nBut he was fired as an independent contractor in 2003 from the St. Clair County Intergovernmental Grants Department for \u201cunacceptable behavior,\u201d Kern said. He declined to elaborate on the incident.\nHodgkinson came back in 2012 and sought paperwork to be reinstated as an independent contractor but he never returned the paperwork.\n\u201cThere were enough employees that were still there that remembered him. The situation still stood from \u201903 and he would not have been allowed back into the program,\u201d Kern said.\nHis views on Scalise\n--------------------\nOn Facebook in 2015, Hodgkinson made at least one comment about the Republican congressman he is accused of eventually attacking in person.\n\u201cHere\u2019s a Republican that should Lose His Job, but they Gave Him a Raise,\u201d Hodgkinson said of Scalise, pointing to a  about the congressman.\nThe cartoon \u2013 which featured Scalise addressing a racist crowd of members of the Klu Klux Klan \u2013 referenced how  speaking to a white supremacist group more than a decade earlier when he was a state legislator in Louisiana.\nThe guns\n--------\nFederal agents are now tracing the origins of the two firearms recovered at the scene of the crime: an SKS 7.62x39 rifle (made in China) and a 9-millimeter pistol, according to a law enforcement source.

U.S. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS WALKING TO PODIUM 2. (SOUNDBITE) (English) U.S. SENATOR, BERNIE SANDERS, SAYING: \u201cThis country today, in my view, has more serious crises than any time since the Great Depression of the 1930\u2019s.

So, all over this country, I have been talking to people and they say - how does it happen? I am producing more, but I am working longer hours for lower wages.
