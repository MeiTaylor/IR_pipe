Fast asleep, in coach. I love this guy.\"\nBut come on. It's not him. There are the tortoise-shell glasses (complete with cord so he can hang them around his neck) -- versus the solid-colored frames he normally wears. Maybe those are his plane glasses, you may think. Maybe before getting on a plane, he puts on his old glasses ... and a pocket square ... and grabs a fedora.\nThe campaign confirmed to The Post that the man pictured isn't Sanders, in case the evidence at hand wasn't obvious enough. But why did so many people (including some prominent ones) pass it around as though it was?\nAnd here comes the take: This is a Sanders that his fans would expect. Flying coach -- and in the middle seat, no less. Tired, as in the first tweet, from his grueling presidential campaign. On his way to keep up the fight in another place.\nPresidential candidates are often the canvasses for voters' projections. Donald Trump's many unorthodox comments and positions are hidden by what so many people want to see in him: A tough fighter who always wins. Hillary Clinton is a woman who has overcome obstacles and constant attack -- unless you're one of the many people who sees her as emblematic of a broken system, or worse. Sanders came into the election with the advantage that Barack Obama enjoyed in 2008 -- relative anonymity. When the canvas is blank, the projections come through much more sharply, as they did eight years ago.\nAnother example from over the weekend: The bird.\nCute, funny, sure. The campaign, recognizing a winner when it sees one, came out with this:\nTogether. pic.twitter.com/I8ca8foKTP\nShaping the projection. Elsewhere, Sanders fans turned the bird moment into Bernie-as-a-Disney princess and more.\nThe Internet plays a role how candidate projections are formed too, of course. Anything on the Internet that's mildly interesting becomes an overblown meme in 14 seconds flat. Take the example of the other sad-looking older gentleman from earlier this month, Sad Pap...[Content truncated]",

He has not run any commercials, instead saving his money for a news media blitz this winter in Iowa, New Hampshire and the Super Tuesday states. His aides are only now preparing to conduct polls, to the consternation of some Sanders advisers who have hungered for data on his political challenges, like courting black and Hispanic voters.\nAnd rather than benefit from million-dollar contributions through a \u201csuper PAC,\u201d Mr. Sanders \u2014 who has called such fund-raising groups corrupt \u2014 has amassed a million online donations over the past five months, faster than Barack Obama did in his first, digitally groundbreaking, campaign for president.\nMr. Sanders reached a turning point on Wednesday night, when his campaign said that it had raised about $26 million since July \u2014 more than Mr. Obama took in for the comparable period in 2007 \u2014 and that it had saved enough since the spring to have about $26.5 million in cash.\nMr. Sanders was initially dismissed by political insiders as a fringe candidate running only to push Hillary Rodham Clinton to the left.

The Vermont senator, who is running for president on a populist message and often speaks passionately about environmental issues, was for months regularly seen flying in coach class on commercial flights.\nThere is even a community of photos on Twitter, under the hashtag #SandersOnAPlane, where fans have posted photos after seeing him fly. There will likely be fewer photos of a luggage-wielding Sanders moving forward.\nThis holiday season, Sanders changed his routine and flew almost exclusively on private chartered planes with members of his traveling staff -- taking at least four trips.\nMost recently, the campaign confirmed, a Gulfstream 200, took the Senator and some staff from Burlington, Vermont two days after Christmas and then from Las Vegas, Nevada to Moline, Illinois for campaign events in eastern Iowa this week.\nDays before the holiday, a private jet whisked the team from Omaha, Nebraska to Chicago, Illinois in order to fit more campaign events into this tight schedule.\nSanders flying commercial in October:\nABC News asked Sanders about whether the extremely high per-person carbon footprint of private planes was consistent with his staunch environmental policies. Sanders often talks about the need for \u201cbold\u201d action on climate change and even criticized the recent international Paris Accord for not going far enough to curb carbon emissions.\n\u201cThe carbon footprint? As opposed to what?\u201d the 74-year-old Senator said recently. \u201cWe are trying to get around Iowa and get around the country as best we can. So we have a lot of people to see and that is the best way can do it.\u201d\nHis campaign spokesman Michael Briggs told ABC News in a statement: \u201cBernie is running for president of the United States and his campaign requires him to travel to many communities in Iowa and New Hampshire and other places as efficiently as possible to meet voters and to answer their questions.\n\u201cWhile he has used commercial airlines on almost all occasions, there are circumstances when using charter airplanes is the best way for him to get around the country and communicate with as many people as possible.\u201d\nThe owner of private plane the campaign most recently used could not be reach for comment for this story, but several charter plane companies provided price estimates for similar flights ranging from $3,000-$15,000.\nMany other candidates, including former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton have frequently used private planes during this campaign.\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

Er, bib.\nFor the first hour and a half of the journey, Ms. Giridhar tried to conceal her excitement about sharing limited legroom with Mr. Chalamet. But when he asked her when the flight would land, Ms. Giridhar couldn\u2019t help addressing his fame. She told him she knew who he was and asked him why he was in economy. \n\u201cHe was just like, \u2018What do you mean?\u2019\u201d Ms. Giridhar said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t actually answer. I said, \u2018People must recognize you.\u2019 And he said, \u2018You\u2019re the only one. Nobody else has.\u2019\u201d\nIn flying coach, Mr. Chalamet joined a long list of public figures who have been noticed in the cheap seats. Prince William flew coach from Memphis to Dallas in 2014 after a wedding. His brother, Harry, and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, reportedly took up three rows with their security team when they traveled to Nice aboard British Airways last year. In 2012, Jessica Alba sat in economy on a trip from Los Angeles to New York while her two kids and their nanny were in first class, according to Radar Online. Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and their six children took an Air France flight from Paris to Nice in 2015, according to The Daily Mail.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
