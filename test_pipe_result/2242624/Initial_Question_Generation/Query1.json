The then CEOs of the big three automakers found themselves tarred and feathered back in 2008 when they each decided to fly company private jets from Detroit to Washington D.C.\nTheir offense for not walking or hitchhiking the 500 miles is that they were coming to the nation’s capital to make a case for a government bailout as the economy tumbled during the Great Recession.\nSenators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren board separate private jets 36 minutes apart to fly ... [+] from the same airport back to Washington D.C., according to a report from ABC News.\nThe images that might have gotten their attention were posted on Twitter by ABC News campaign reporter Adam Kelsey (above). They showed on the left a snapshot of Vermont Senator and Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders climbing into what appears to be a large cabin private jet. The other picture claims to show Massachusetts Senator and White House apprentice Elizabeth Warren boarding a midsize Learjet.\nKelsey caption the pictures on his Tweet, “So long (for now). @BernieSanders and @ewarren are both on their way back to DC. Here they each are boarding flights from the same general aviation airport at DSM just 36 minutes apart.”\nThe image was posted on Sunday, Feb. 2, 2020, so apparently they were on their way back for the impeachment trial of President Donald J. Trump the next day where their attendance was mandatory.\n\nThere were multiple options for Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to fly commercially ...

Minneapolis to the meeting in the Oval Office, stop for a crucial photo opportunity outside the West Wing, and head back to Iowa to square off against Bill Clinton in Mason City, the Vermont senator went from looking like a fringe phenomenon to looking like a potential president.\nObama had been promising face time for months, but it was only after an interview he gave on his legacy was  that the president felt the need to rebalance his public stance in the crucial few days leading up to the Iowa caucus.\n“I thought the interview that he gave was not a biased interview,” said Sanders  in the back of his campaign bus late last week. “But I think the media picked up on it and the Clinton people spun it.”\nWas this Obama’s attempt to level the playing field?\n“Yup, perhaps,” Sanders told the Guardian. “I do think it was nice of the president for us to sit down and chat for 45 minutes.”\nIn the ensuing chase across the prairies by the competing campaign buses, it became clear that the battle for Iowa was to turn into a battle for the right to be considered the true heir to Obama.\nFor Clinton, many current White House aides and the former Obama staffers who populate her campaign team, there is no doubt. Her more cautious policy platform is a way to ensure that progress achieved in the last eight years is not reversed by Republicans.\nBut for Sanders, Obama’s difficulties with Congress are proof that change cannot come by presidential fiat alone. His call for a “political revolution”, although vague, rests on the notion that the next president needs to bring the wave of support that gets them elected all the way to Washington, and keep it there.\nThe central question before voters in Iowa therefore became one of experience over hope: could sceptical midwesterners who were sold once on change be persuaded to buy the extra-strength version, only in less attractive packaging? Or would they opt for \nThe lack of marketing gloss on Sanders is hard to overstate. Though the rumpled look and wild hair may have attracted a cult following among younger voters, this anti-candidate could not break more rules of political television if he tried.\nHe is constantly hoarse from shouting. His staff and family fight a losing battle to keep dandruff from his baggy suits and a somewhat cantankerous temper from obscuring what can still prove to be an avuncular charm.\nDuring our interview on his tour bus, it was left to his wife, Jane, to rescue our photographer when Bernie refused to move from his favourite comfy arm chair into a bench seat that had better lighting.\n“Let him...[Content truncated]",
