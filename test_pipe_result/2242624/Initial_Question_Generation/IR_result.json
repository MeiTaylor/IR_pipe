Sanders is joined on the Thirty-Two Hour Workweek Act in the Senate by Sen. Laphonza Butler (D-Calif.) and in the House of Representatives by Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) who introduced companion legislation.“Moving to a 32-hour workweek with no loss of pay is not a radical idea,” said Sen. Sanders. “Today, American workers are over 400 percent more productive than they were in the 1940s. And yet, millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages than they were decades ago. That has got to change. The financial gains from the major advancements in artificial intelligence, automation, and new technology must benefit the working class, not just corporate CEOs and wealthy stockholders on Wall Street. It is time to reduce the stress level in our country and allow Americans to enjoy a better quality of life. It is time for a 32-hour workweek with no loss in pay.”This legislation comes ahead of a HELP Committee hearing Chairman Sanders is leading this Thursday on the same issue.

But Sanders is no longer running as the party’s lone progressive populist, as he did in 2016.

Sanders, who was well off the pace in third, trailed her in the state by more than 10 points, 22% to 11%.\nPerhaps more worrying to some Sanders supporters, the Massachusetts progressive also overtook her colleague from Vermont with what has traditionally been his most reliable bloc of support: voters under 35, among whom Warren now leads in Iowa, 27% to Sanders’ 22%.\nAsked by a reporter on Sunday about the poll, Sanders said the campaign’s internal...[Content truncated]",

Incredibly corrupt. They have unlimited amounts of money.”\nJoseph Crawford, a 19-year-old who is taking a break from college, said he started listening to Sanders speak in 2016, even though he couldn’t vote then.

    "QA": {
        "Question": "Does the video show Bernie Sanders traveling in coach during his presidential campaign?",
        "Answer": "The video does not show Bernie Sanders traveling in coach during his presidential campaign, as there is no mention of him specifically in the context of the video content itself. The video description does not indicate any scenes featuring Sanders or specifics about the class of service he is utilizing for travel. Instead, the video focuses on various general indoor environments and individuals seemingly in motion without specifically identifying Sanders or his travel arrangements. However, there is substantial evidence outside of the video that supports the claim that Bernie Sanders typically flies coach during his presidential campaign. For example, a New York Times article from October 1, 2015, states, \"Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont still flies coach to his campaign events, sometimes taking the middle seat,\" confirming his preference for budget-friendly travel during the campaign. Additionally, CNN reported in December 2015 that Sanders has been frequently appearing on commercial airlines, highlighting that he is a candidate who is \"most likely to pop up in your feed before his boarding call\" in coach rather than first class. Nonetheless, the evidence also indicates that by late December 2015, Sanders began to fly private planes more frequently, changing from his previously consistent coach travel, particularly during the holiday season. Given this context, while the evidence strongly indicates that Sanders has flown coach, the video itself does not substantiate the claim regarding his travel during the campaign.",
