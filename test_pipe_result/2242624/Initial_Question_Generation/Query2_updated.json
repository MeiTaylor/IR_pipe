Sanders is joined on the Thirty-Two Hour Workweek Act in the Senate by Sen. Laphonza Butler (D-Calif.) and in the House of Representatives by Rep.

And yet, millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages than they were decades ago. That has got to change. The financial gains from the major advancements in artificial intelligence, automation, and new technology must benefit the working class, not just corporate CEOs and wealthy stockholders on Wall Street. It is time to reduce the stress level in our country and allow Americans to enjoy a better quality of life. It is time for a 32-hour workweek with no loss in pay.\u201dThis legislation comes ahead of a HELP Committee hearing Chairman Sanders is leading this Thursday on the same issue.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks to voters during a campaign event at Cafe Dodici January 29, 2016 in Washington, Iowa.\nAlex Wong/Getty Images\nCNN \u00a0\u2014\u00a0\nSen.  is preparing to renew his focus on early-voting states Iowa and New Hampshire, as frustrations grow inside his presidential campaign over slumping poll numbers and a series of taxing clashes between lower level staff and national leadership.\nThe campaign\u2019s in-house production team recently began shooting its first television ads of the  in Iowa, likely quieting at least one source of dissent among some senior aides, who have been pushing for Sanders to get on the air.\nBut concerns over the trajectory of Vermont independent\u2019s second presidential bid as new evidence emerges that Sen.  is beginning to peel away at his base are becoming more pronounced, along with a realization that a failure to launch in Iowa and New Hampshire could spell the campaign\u2019s early doom.\nAd Feedback\nSanders began his 2020 run dedicated to hammering away at the argument that he, more than any other Democrat, was best positioned to deny President Donald Trump a second term. But Sanders is no longer running as the party\u2019s lone progressive populist, as he did in 2016. Warren\u2019s emergence in that space, and the sense among some Democrats that she is a better bet to successfully unite the party than Sanders or Biden has altered the shape of the race.\n Joshua Lott/Getty Images Related article Elizabeth Warren surges and Joe Biden fades in close Iowa race, new poll shows]\nThe new dynamic came into sharp relief last weekend, when a CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey showed Warren surging into the top tier in Iowa with former Vice President Joe Biden. Sanders, who was well off the pace in third, trailed her in the state by more than 10 points, 22% to 11%.\nPerhaps more worrying to some Sanders supporters, the Massachusetts progressive also overtook her colleague from Vermont with what has traditionally been his most reliable bloc of support: voters under 35, among whom Warren now leads in Iowa, 27% to Sanders\u2019 22%.\nAsked by a reporter on Sunday about the poll, Sanders said the campaign\u2019s internal...[Content truncated]",

With sad irony, Avatar believes that the current crisis has presented it with various windows of economic opportunities to acquire aircraft at greatly reduced prices and/or in exchange for equity.\nFor informational purposes, we include a preliminary offer (letter of intent) that was issued to British Airways to acquire its fleet of 26 retired 747's. If consummated, it will provide a substantial leap forward in Avatar meeting the Department's economic requirements for certification, but - much more than that - it will provide a path for Avatar to become a major player in helping to rebuild and revitalize our badly battered industry in a post-COVID-19 world.\nEven as our industry deals with the crisis immediately in front of it, respectfully, this Department ought not look disfavorably to Avatar and Avatar's eyes firmly focused on the future. There is a silent majority of budget-conscious travelers whose ability to traverse the USA safely and affordably, hangs in the balance. We would hope the Department gives due consideration to their interests, as it indulges Avatar in its plans to move forward with its vision for the future of air travel.\nAttachments1\n------------\nFile PDF Icon\n### Avatar Airlines Incorporated (Letter of Intent to British Airways)",
