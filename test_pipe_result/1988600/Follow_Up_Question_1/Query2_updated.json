Since I did not live near a desert (I lived in Kansas, which is mostly grasslands), I thought all those desert creatures were so exotic and amazing. To this day, I am fascinated by deserts. Well, I'm actually fascinated by every natural habitat, but deserts are extra amazing.\nThe jerboa is an example of an animal with extreme adaptations to the unique conditions existing in deserts. Let's take a closer look.\n**What\u00a0the heck is a Jerboa?**\nJerboas are rodents that live mainly in the extremely hot deserts of\u00a0Asia and\u00a0northern Africa. The most striking characteristic is their disproportionately long hind legs, which allow them to hop like a kangaroo. There are 33 species of jerboas, all of them in the family,\u00a0Dipodidae. Below is a\u00a0_long-eared jerboa_.\n!\n**Amazing facts about Jerboas**\nJerboas are fast, and they get around by jumping (like kangaroos). To help them do this, they have hind legs that are at least four times longer than their font legs. But they have a strange habit of zigzagging back and forth as they run (or hop). One possible reason for this is that it helps them avoid predators, such as snakes and owls. Also, this pattern may help them find food sources, which, in a desert, tend to be spread out and random. There must be a darn good reason they zigzag like this, because studies show that this is not as energy-efficient as hopping in a straight line. Even so, jerboas can run (hop) up to 16 miles per hour (25 km/hr).\nJerboas don't drink water. Ever. Instead, they get all the water they need from the food they...[Content truncated]",

Most of the specimens photographed today are members of the family Dipodidae, which includes\u00a0.\nI\u2019ve actually posted about that incredibly special individual before when I came across it  \u2013 it is the Baluchistan pygmy jerboa, aka the dwarf three-toed jerboa \u2013\u00a0_Salpingotulus michaelis \u2013_\u00a0and is the only species in the genus _Salpingotulus_. \u00a0In addition to the remarkable fact that this specimen is a rare sight in its native Pakistan habitat, back in 1967 it was confirmed that our museum was one of only five museums in the entire world to have one of these guys in their collection!\nThe other specimens photographed include the two largest jerboas identified as \u2019_Allactaga jaculus_\u2019, which apparently is an outdated nomenclature combining two genera instead of a genus and a species name, so I can\u2019t be positive what they actually are. \u00a0The third largest is Ord\u2019s kangaroo rat (_Dipodomys ordii)_\u00a0of the family Heteromyidae, included to show the similarities between members of the same family. \u00a0To contrast, the second-to-smallest is the western jumping mouse (_Zapus princeps)_ which is in the family Dipodidae, but looks less similar than the Ord\u2019s kangaroo rat. \u00a0WHEW \u2013 did you get all of that?!\nSecondly, a gigantic THANK YOU to everyone who left comments and sent messages for suggestions on improving this blog! \u00a0I\u2019m so pleased to see so many of you invested and interested in this project, and really value your input, so a tremendous thanks again.\nDid I mention that you can now  texts/video/photos/ for identification?! I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t enable this feature sooner! \u00a0Stay tuned for another post later today where I will talk about some identification techniques, and mention a few good books for ID reference. \u00a0It\u2019s going to be AWESOME",

Brooke Bond pictures cards were given away free inside boxes of tea (the tea-producing branch of the company later became known as PG Tips) and, for a small fee, collectors could send off for an album. Hugely influential to young people that grew up in tea-drinking households during the 1960s and 70s, many of the series were devoted to natural history, and they are fondly remembered by many people who work today in the biological sciences. They explain my fascination with the artwork of Peter Scott, Charles Tunnicliffe and Maurice Wilson.\nWhile, mostly, I looked after the albums that I inherited from my mother - who collected the cards herself as a girl - there were a few that I unfortunately defaced and mutilated, Asian Wild Life among them. So today I'm happy to have back in my hands not one, but two, pristine, completed albums. Like several of the Brooke Bond picture cards series, Asian Wild Life was both written and illustrated by the fantastic Charles F. Tunnicliffe (1901-1979). And there is always one picture in particular that fascinated me, and today still does: it's Tunnicliffe's painting (reproduced below) of two Yarkand jerboas Euchoreutes naso, bounding together across the steppes of north-west China.\nEuchoreutes has to be one of the oddest-looking rodents and, years later, when I learnt about the rhinogradentians, I wondered if Euchoreutes wasn't really a jerboa at all, but in fact a wayward rhinogradentian, perhaps related to the Earwing Otopteryx volitans. Even the binomial - Euchoreutes naso - is suggestive of some link with rhinogradentians given that the latter group includes the nasobemes (genus Nasobema). Like earwings, Euchoreutes has ridiculously enormous ears, and its alternative name is the Long-eared jerboa. If anything, Tunnicliffe's painting actually doesn't make the ears appear large enough: in photos, the ears look to be about as long as the entire body.\nAnd in body length, Euchoreutes is just 70-90 mm long. That's small, but not as small as the Baluchistan pygmy jerboa Salpingotus michaelis: with a body length of 36-47 mm it's the smallest living rodent (it's also relatively new to science, having only been discovered in 1966 and named in 1973).
