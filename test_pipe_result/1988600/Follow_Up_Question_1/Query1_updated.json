Most of the specimens photographed today are members of the family Dipodidae, which includes\u00a0.\nI\u2019ve actually posted about that incredibly special individual before when I came across it  \u2013 it is the Baluchistan pygmy jerboa, aka the dwarf three-toed jerboa \u2013\u00a0_Salpingotulus michaelis \u2013_\u00a0and is the only species in the genus _Salpingotulus_. \u00a0In addition to the remarkable fact that this specimen is a rare sight in its native Pakistan habitat, back in 1967 it was confirmed that our museum was one of only five museums in the entire world to have one of these guys in their collection!\nThe other specimens photographed include the two largest jerboas identified as \u2019_Allactaga jaculus_\u2019, which apparently is an outdated nomenclature combining two genera instead of a genus and a species name, so I can\u2019t be positive what they actually are. \u00a0The third largest is Ord\u2019s kangaroo rat (_Dipodomys ordii)_\u00a0of the family Heteromyidae, included to show the similarities between members of the same family. \u00a0To contrast, the second-to-smallest is the western jumping mouse (_Zapus princeps)_ which is in the family Dipodidae, but looks less similar than the Ord\u2019s kangaroo rat. \u00a0WHEW \u2013 did you get all of that?!\nSecondly, a gigantic THANK YOU to everyone who left comments and sent messages for suggestions on improving this blog! \u00a0I\u2019m so pleased to see so many of you invested and interested in this project, and really value your input, so a tremendous thanks again.\nDid I mention that you can now  texts/video/photos/ for identification?! I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t enable this feature sooner! \u00a0Stay tuned for another post later today where I will talk about some identification techniques, and mention a few good books for ID reference. \u00a0It\u2019s going to be AWESOME",

Head-body 41-45 mm, tail 72-94 mm, ear 6-11 mm, hindfoot 18\u2014 19 mm; weight 4 g. The Balochistan PygmyJerboa is very small. Condylo-basal lengths of skulls are 12:8-14-3 mm, mastoid breadths are 13-3-14-7 mm, and maxillary tooth row lengths are 2-6-2-8 mm. Head and dorsum are pale yellow-ocher or sandy buff; sides and ventral pelage are pure white. Tail is fatty, with relatively long black terminal tuft; fat deposits in tail are greatest in anterior one-third and rapidly become thinner toward tip. Hindfeet have three toes, covered below with brushes of white hairs; toes do not have conic calluses at bases. Ears are short and tubiform. Auditory bullae are greatly inflated and strongly project from under braincase laterally and caudally. Mastoid cavity is large and completely subdivided into three sections by septum. In volume, mastoid cavity is about twice as large as tympanic cavity. Front surfaces of incisors are yellow. P' is present and slightly smaller in diameter than M\u00ae. Molars are low-crowned, with tuberculous surfaces; crown heights of unworn molars are \u00a2.70% of their lengths. Glans penis is small, thin, elongated, cone-shaped, and not subdivided into lobes, with surface covered by very small single-vertex, backward-directed aciculae not differentiated in size. Os penis (baculum) is rudimentary and rachis-like; its length about equal to one-tenth of the length of glans penis.\n\n Habitat. Rolling sand dunes, sandy plains,orflat gravel plains with wind-moving sand layer in hot deserts at elevations of 1000-1600 m.\n\n Food and Feeding. The Balochistan Pygmy Jerboa mainly eats grass seeds and some other plant material.\n\n Breeding. Pregnant Balochistan Pygmy Jerboas were recorded in June-August...[Content truncated]",

This video:\nMy friends, I am generally fascinated by the range of strangeness that mother nature puts on display. But I have to admit that I kind of hoped this clip would turn out to be some kind of hoax. It was just _too freaky_. The way that caterpillar-y butt looks too bulbous and heavy for the delicate moth body it sits atop. The sheer length of the four (count them, four) tentacles affixed at the end. The way those tentacles wiggled and writhed. The fact that they were _hairy_. It was simply too much.\nAlas, a quick Google search identified this very real animal as , a moth found in Southeast Asia and Australia. Those furiously freaky tendrils are actually scent organs. The so-called coremata (also known as , which, ew) excrete pheromones, those scented hormones that many animals use to trigger certain behaviors in their fellow critters. The male, guided by the smell of a female\u2019s own hormones, will unleash his hair-pencils (they\u2019re usually stuffed inside the abdomen, which is somehow worse?) and flood the air with his own smelly signals. So, so romantic.\nFor those of us who aren\u2019t from Australia, also known as the island-of-horrible-things-that-evolved-to-scare-and-kill-you, _Creatonotos gangis_ seems so strange as to be impossible. But just as these moths are unfortunately real, many other seemingly absurd creatures prove that evolution can go to some dark, dark places. Here are a few other examples:\nGoblin sharks, ghost sharks, etc.\n...[Content truncated]",
