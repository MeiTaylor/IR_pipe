Some sources say the species is actually omnivorous and may eat the dead remains of lizards and other rodents.] The species is known to be able to undergo a period of diurnal rhythm of physiological dormancy, where their respiratory functions, blood circulation and other bodily functions slow dramatically to allow them to survive on a diet of low nutritional value. This phenomenon is known as facultative hypothermia.]\nConservation Status\\\\]\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVery little is known about what threatens the pygmy jerboa, as the species is nocturnal and difficult to approach.

They inhabit dry and arid desert environments and frequent sandy dunes and gravel flats. The pygmy jerboa enjoys altitudes of 1,000-1,600m (3,280-5,249ft).] While the species is currently known entirely from Pakistan, it likely also occurs in Afghanistan but has not yet been reported there.] The exact population of the Baluchistan pygmy jerboa is unknown.]\nBehaviour\\\\]\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAn enigmatic species, very little is known about the Baluchistan pygmy jerboa's behavioural characteristics. They are nocturnal and are most active at night. In the dry season, pygmy jerboas are known to dig into the roots of dying plants to feed on them.] Baluchistan pygmy jerboas live underground in deep burrows, and give birth to about 2-4 pups around twice a year] in the safety of burrows in which they typically excavate under bushes and shrubs.]\n### Relationship with Humans\\\\]\nVery little can be gathered about the relation that pygmy jerboas have with humans, this is because they are a nocturnal species and rarely interact with humans.\nIn Captivity\\\\]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIt is illegal to keep the Baluchistan pygmy jerboa as a pet in multiple countries including the USA.]]...[Content truncated]",

Since I did not live near a desert (I lived in Kansas, which is mostly grasslands), I thought all those desert creatures were so exotic and amazing. To this day, I am fascinated by deserts. Well, I'm actually fascinated by every natural habitat, but deserts are extra amazing.\nThe jerboa is an example of an animal with extreme adaptations to the unique conditions existing in deserts. Let's take a closer look.\nWhat the heck is a Jerboa?\nJerboas are rodents that live mainly in the extremely hot deserts of Asia and northern Africa. The most striking characteristic is their disproportionately long hind legs, which allow them to hop like a kangaroo. There are 33 species of jerboas, all of them in the family, Dipodidae. Below is a long-eared jerboa.\nAmazing facts about Jerboas\nJerboas are fast, and they get around by jumping (like kangaroos). To help them do this, they have hind legs that are at least four times longer than their font legs. But they have a strange habit of zigzagging back and forth as they run (or hop). One possible reason for this is that it helps them avoid predators, such as snakes and owls. Also, this pattern may help them find food sources, which, in a desert, tend to be spread out and random. There must be a darn good reason they zigzag like this, because studies show that this is not as energy-efficient as hopping in a straight line. Even so, jerboas can run (hop) up to 16 miles per hour (25 km/hr).\nJerboas don't drink water. Ever. Instead, they get...[Content truncated]",

Jerboas are hopping desert rodents and are found in Northern Africa and some parts of Asia.\nadvertisement\nA Jerboa can easily pass off as a mini kangaroo. It has long hind legs and shorter front ones. It has a small frame of 1.7 inch and is also known as Dwarf Three-Toed Jerboa.\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List states them to be populated in **Pakistan and Afghanistan.**\nJerboa's movement is usually by leaping horizontally, vertically and zigzag and they do not drink water directly. Instead, they get it through plants and insects they eat.\nThis cute clan has 33 species in total.\nPublished By:\nAtMigration\nPublished On:\nFeb 24, 2016\n\\--- ENDS ---\nAdvertisement\nAlso Watch\n----------\n 12:03]\n### \n 0:40]\n### \n 7:54]\n### \n 33:41]\n### \n 0:59]\n### \nAdvertisement\nRead This\n---------\n]\n### \n]\n### \n]\n### \n]\n### \n]\n### \nAdvertisement\nFollow Us On: ]\nAdvertisement\n### PUBLICATIONS\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n### TELEVISION\n*   \n*   \n*   \n### EVENTS\n*   \n*   \n*   \n### RADIO\n*   \n*   \n### GAMING\n*   \n*   \n### USEFUL...[Content truncated]",

These tiny desert rodents have a distinctive appearance and thrive in the harsh, dry desert environments of Eastern Europe, Northern Africa, and Asia.\nThere are approximately 33 species of jerboas. They all share the same general features of a tiny, mouse-like head; large, owlish eyes; disproportionately long ears, and a long, powerful tail. They also have very short arms and long, cat-like whiskers that they use to navigate their environments. As its name suggests, the long-eared jerboa has even longer ears than other species of this rodent!\nThese features have a purpose. The bent hind legs enable Jerboas to leap up to 10 feet at a bound when necessary for speed. They can also use all four limbs for hopping, but use just the hing legs for walking. The long tail is like a prop when standing and is used for balance springing up.\nJerboas only grow to be two to six inches long, and their tails can be more than twice as long as their head and body combined. Both males and females share a similarly soft, sand-colored coat of fur that helps them blend into their desert surroundings, and both sexes only weigh about an ounce when fully grown – about the weight of a standard lightbulb.\nThey are crepuscular, which means that they are most active...[Content truncated]",
