Some sources say the species is actually omnivorous and may eat the dead remains of lizards and other rodents.] The species is known to be able to undergo a period of diurnal rhythm of physiological dormancy, where their respiratory functions, blood circulation and other bodily functions slow dramatically to allow them to survive on a diet of low nutritional value.

Since I did not live near a desert (I lived in Kansas, which is mostly grasslands), I thought all those desert creatures were so exotic and amazing. To this day, I am fascinated by deserts. Well, I'm actually fascinated by every natural habitat, but deserts are extra amazing.\nThe jerboa is an example of an animal with extreme adaptations to the unique conditions existing in deserts. Let's take a closer look.\nWhat\u00a0the heck is a Jerboa?\nJerboas are rodents that live mainly in the extremely hot deserts of\u00a0Asia and\u00a0northern Africa. The most striking characteristic is their disproportionately long hind legs, which allow them to hop like a kangaroo. There are 33 species of jerboas, all of them in the family,\u00a0Dipodidae. Below is a\u00a0long-eared jerboa.\nAmazing facts about Jerboas\nJerboas are fast, and they get around by jumping (like kangaroos). To help them do this, they have hind legs that are at least four times longer than their font legs. But they have a strange habit of zigzagging back and forth as they run (or hop). One possible reason for this is that it helps them avoid predators, such as snakes and owls. Also, this pattern may help them find food sources, which, in a desert, tend to be spread out and random. There must be a darn good reason they zigzag like this, because studies show that this is not as energy-efficient as hopping in a straight line. Even so, jerboas can run (hop) up to 16 miles per hour (25 km/hr).\nJerboas don't drink water. Ever. Instead, they get...[Content truncated]",

It holds membership in the Dipodinae, or \"jumping rodents,\" family, which includes several different genera.  The jerboa belongs to one of three genera that include more than two dozen species, more than 20 of them in Asia. \n\nTypically, the jerboa has a mouse- or rat-like head and body, cat-like sensory whiskers, owl-like eyes, squirrel-like to jackrabbit-like ears, kangaroo-like back legs, prairie dog-like forelegs and a disproportionally long, sometimes tufted, distinctive tail. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nDistribution, Habitat and Diet\nThe jerboa's range extends from Asia west southwestward across northern Africa.  It often favors arid sandy habitats such as the Gobi Desert, where temperatures may fall to near zero during the cold of winter, and the Sahara Desert, where temperatures may rise to more than 130 degrees Fahrenheit in the heat of summer.  Foraging primarily at night, the jerboa eats plants, seeds and insects, depending on its food to meet its need for water.  It may never actually drink free water throughout its life.\nBehavior\nA nocturnal animal that spends most of its daylight hours sequestered beneath the surface of the ground, the jerboa has kept much of its behavior secret.  It is, however, best known for its leaping ability, which it uses to escape predators.  \"When about to spring,\" said the Encyclopedia Britannica, 9th Edition, the jerboa \"raises its body by means of the hinder extremities, and supports itself at the same time upon its tail, while the forefeet are so closely pressed to the breast as to be scarcely visible...  It then leaps into the air...[Content truncated]",

Hind legs help him to walk upright and perform long jumps. Jerboa species have their habitat starting from North Africa to Central Asia. Also, these species tend to stay in hot places.\nThe specialty of a long eared Jerboa species is, when it is chased, it can run at up to 24 kilometres per hour (15 mph).\nHowever, some species become prey to little owls (Athene noctua) in central Asia.\nBesides this, jerboa species have the extraordinary hearing ability that helps them off becoming prey of nocturnal predators. Jerboa mice can survive for a maximum of six years.\nThe Jerboa animal has its naming and taxonomy, classification and paleontology, description, adaptations, habitat, diet, life cycle, the purpose of living, and subspecies, which we will understand on this page.\nBesides these key points on four toed Jerboa, we will have a look at some amazing Jerboa Animal Facts.\n### What is a Jerboa Animal?\nJerboa is any of the 33 species among the long-tailed leaping rodents. They are well adapted to arid regions and steppes of eastern Europe, Asia, and northern Africa.\nThey resemble mice with body lengths ranging between 5 and 15 cm (2 to 5.9 inches) in length and long tails of 7 to 25 cm.\nCertain traits, like the size of the ears, vary between species, i.e., it may range from small and round to slender and rabbitlike or exceptionally large and broad.\nHind toes number may also vary from three to five in a count, however, all species have short forelegs and extremely long hind legs. Often the tail is tufted,\u00a0 dense fur is either silky or velvety in texture and light in appearance, usually matching the ground of the animal\u2019s habitat. You can see these characteristics in the below Jerboa Animal image:\n(Image will be Uploaded Soon)\n### Jerboa Scientific Classification\n<table style=\"border-width: initial; border-style: none; border-color: initial; table-layout: fixed; width: 468pt;\"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr style=\"height:0pt\"><td style=\"border-width:...[Content truncated]",
