Most of the specimens photographed today are members of the family Dipodidae, which includes .\nI’ve actually posted about that incredibly special individual before when I came across it  – it is the Baluchistan pygmy jerboa, aka the dwarf three-toed jerboa – _Salpingotulus michaelis –_ and is the only species in the genus _Salpingotulus_.  In addition to the remarkable fact that this specimen is a rare sight in its native Pakistan habitat, back in 1967 it was confirmed that our museum was one of only five museums in the entire world to have one of these guys in their collection!\nThe other specimens photographed include the two largest jerboas identified as ’_Allactaga jaculus_’, which apparently is an outdated nomenclature combining two genera instead of a genus and a species name, so I can’t be positive what they actually are.  The third largest is Ord’s kangaroo rat (_Dipodomys ordii)_ of the family Heteromyidae, included to show the similarities between members of the same family.  To contrast, the second-to-smallest is the western jumping mouse (_Zapus princeps)_ which is in the family Dipodidae, but looks less similar than the Ord’s kangaroo rat.  WHEW – did you get all of that?!\nSecondly, a gigantic THANK YOU to everyone who left comments and sent messages for suggestions on improving this blog!  I’m so pleased to see so many of you invested and interested in this project, and really value your input, so a tremendous thanks again.\nDid I mention that you can now  texts/video/photos/ for identification?! I don’t know why I didn’t enable this feature sooner!  Stay tuned for another post later today where I will talk about some identification techniques, and mention a few good books for ID reference.  It’s going to be AWESOME",

Head-body 41-45 mm, tail 72-94 mm, ear 6-11 mm, hindfoot 18— 19 mm; weight 4 g. The Balochistan PygmyJerboa is very small. Condylo-basal lengths of skulls are 12:8-14-3 mm, mastoid breadths are 13-3-14-7 mm, and maxillary tooth row lengths are 2-6-2-8 mm. Head and dorsum are pale yellow-ocher or sandy buff; sides and ventral pelage are pure white. Tail is fatty, with relatively long black terminal tuft; fat deposits in tail are greatest in anterior one-third and rapidly become thinner toward tip. Hindfeet have three toes, covered below with brushes of white hairs; toes do not have conic calluses at bases. Ears are short and tubiform. Auditory bullae are greatly inflated and strongly project from under braincase laterally and caudally. Mastoid cavity is large and completely subdivided into three sections by septum. In volume, mastoid cavity is about twice as large as tympanic cavity. Front surfaces of incisors are yellow. P' is present and slightly smaller in diameter than M®. Molars are low-crowned, with tuberculous surfaces; crown heights of unworn molars are ¢.70% of their lengths. Glans penis is small, thin, elongated, cone-shaped, and not subdivided into lobes, with surface covered by very small single-vertex, backward-directed aciculae not differentiated in size. Os penis (baculum) is rudimentary and rachis-like; its length about equal to one-tenth of the length of glans penis.\n\n Habitat. Rolling sand dunes, sandy plains,orflat gravel plains with wind-moving sand layer in hot deserts at elevations of 1000-1600 m.\n\n Food and Feeding. The Balochistan Pygmy Jerboa mainly eats grass seeds and some other plant material.\n\n Breeding. Pregnant Balochistan Pygmy Jerboas were recorded in June-August...[Content truncated]",

Rodents are the largest group of mammals, constituting almost half the class Mammalia’s approximately 4,660 species. They are indigenous to every land area except Antarctica, New Zealand, and a few Arctic and other oceanic islands, although some species have been introduced even to those places through their association with humans. This huge order of animals encompasses 27 separate families, including not only the “true” rats and mice (family Muridae) but also such diverse groups as porcupines, beavers, squirrels, marmots, pocket gophers, and chinchillas.\nAll rodents possess constantly growing rootless incisors that have a hard enamel layer on the front of each tooth and softer dentine behind. The differential wear from gnawing creates perpetually sharp chisel edges. Rodents’ absence of other incisors and canine teeth results in a gap, or diastema, between incisors and cheek teeth, which number from 22 (5 on each side of the upper and lower jaws) to 4, may be rooted or rootless and ever-growing, and may be low- or high-crowned. The nature of the jaw articulation ensures that incisors do not meet when food is chewed and that upper and lower cheek teeth (premolars and molars) do not make contact while the animal gnaws. Powerful and intricately divided masseter muscles, attached to jaw and skull in different arrangements, provide most of the power for chewing and gnawing.\nThe range in body size between the mouse (18 grams [0.64 ounce], body 12 cm [4.7 inches] long) and the marmot (3,000 grams, body 50 cm long) spans the majority of living rodents, but the extremes are remarkable. One of the smallest is Delany’s swamp mouse (Delanymys brooksi), associated with bamboo in the marshes and mountain forests in Africa. It weighs 5 to 7 grams, and the body is 5 to 6 cm long. The largest is the capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) of Central and South America, which weighs...[Content truncated]",

When adding the 12 feral or well-established introduced non-native species, the number of mammalian orders represented in the UAE fauna raises to eight and the number of families to 21 (Fig. 14.2b). Six species, and probably seven if we include the Honey Badger, can be considered as locally extinct. Among the 37 extant (i.e. still living) native species, bats are the most diversified with 13 species, followed by the rodents with nine species, and the carnivores with seven species. The geographic position of the United Arab Emirates, at the crossroad of different continents and biogeographic realms, is reflected in its mammal fauna. Without entering in the phylogenetic origin of the species, but broadly considering their extant distribution ranges, the native mammalian fauna of UAE has a more important palearctic origin (55% of species), than afro-tropical (32%), while the Indomalaya origin accounts for only two species (the Indian Crested Porcupine and the White-tailed Mongoose). Spatially, mammal diversity is the highest in the Hajar Mountains (Fig. 14.3), with 19 species regularly using mountainous habitats, but only four of them are strictly confined to this ecosystem, most of them are also using other habitats, like shrublands, farms or forested areas.\n(a) Number of native species recorded in UAE per taxonomic order, with reference to their endemicity. (b) Number of native and introduced mammal species, recorded in UAE per taxonomic order\nTypical landscape in the Hajar Mountains, here in wadi Shees (Sharjah Emirate). Photo credit: Jacky Judas\nNine species of native rodents are known in UAE, distributed among three families: the porcupine family (Hystricidae, one species), the Jerboa family (Dipodidae, one species), and the mouse and rat family (Muridae, seven species). In this last family, the sub-family of Gerbils and Jirds (Gerbillinae) is the most diverse with six species, while only one true native mouse is present, the Arabian Spiny Mouse (Acomys dimidiatus, Fig. 14.4). The latter is a nocturnal sociable species, that forages at night for seeds, and sometimes insects and grasses. It is mainly found in the wadi beds of the Hajar mountains, and more rarely in farms or...[Content truncated]",
