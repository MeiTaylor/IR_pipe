                    "content": "I want to thank reader David Bayly for sending me several great ideas for Awesome Animals, of which the Jerboa was one.\nWhen I was a kid, I watched a Disney movie called\u00a0_The Living Desert_. Since I did not live near a desert (I lived in Kansas, which is mostly grasslands), I thought all those desert creatures were so exotic and amazing. To this day, I am fascinated by deserts. Well, I'm actually fascinated by every natural habitat, but deserts are extra amazing.\nThe jerboa is an example of an animal with extreme adaptations to the unique conditions existing in deserts. Let's take a closer look.\n**What\u00a0the heck is a Jerboa?**\nJerboas are rodents that live mainly in the extremely hot deserts of\u00a0Asia and\u00a0northern Africa. The most striking characteristic is their disproportionately long hind legs, which allow them to hop like a kangaroo. There are 33 species of jerboas, all of them in the family,\u00a0Dipodidae. Below is a\u00a0_long-eared jerboa_.\n!\n**Amazing facts about Jerboas**\nJerboas are fast, and they get around by jumping (like kangaroos). To help them do this, they have hind legs that are at least four times longer than their font legs. But they have a strange habit of zigzagging back and forth as they run (or hop). One possible reason for this is that it helps them avoid predators, such as snakes and owls. Also, this pattern may help them find food sources, which, in a desert, tend to be spread out and random. There must be a darn good reason they zigzag like this, because studies show that this is not as energy-efficient as hopping in a straight line. Even so, jerboas can run (hop) up to 16 miles per hour (25 km/hr).\nJerboas don't drink water. Ever. Instead, they get all the water they need from the food they eat. Their diet consists mainly of plants, although unlike many other rodents, they are incapable of eating hard seeds. They also will happily eat any insects they can catch.\nSix of the...[Content truncated]",

However, a glut of good photos are now available, as explained below. Incidentally, do not ever google the term 'Asian wild life'.\n-------------------------------------------------\nIt's funny how things work out. Today I am obsessed with rodents. Why? Most of my day was spent clearing out an old loft, and while rummaging through decades of accumulated rubbish I came across multiple copies of old Brooke Bond picture card albums, and among them one of my favourites: Tunnicliffe's Asian Wild Life. Brooke Bond pictures cards were given away free inside boxes of tea (the tea-producing branch of the company later became known as PG Tips) and, for a small fee, collectors could send off for an album. Hugely influential to young people that grew up in tea-drinking households during the 1960s and 70s, many of the series were devoted to natural history, and they are fondly remembered by many people who work today in the biological sciences. They explain my fascination with the artwork of Peter Scott, Charles Tunnicliffe and Maurice Wilson...[Content truncated]",
