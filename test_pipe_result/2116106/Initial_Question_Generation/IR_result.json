This year marks the Obamas' last Christmas card as the first family (_tear_) so they really wanted to bring it home in style. They chose an image from the Canada State Dinner this past Spring, when the whole family was dressed to the nines. First Lady Michelle stunned in a strapless dress by Jason Wu while President Obama chose a classic tuxedo.  looked resplendent on the arms of their parents, both in gowns by Naeem Khan.\n#### Instagram content\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it  from.\nAround the time the photo was taken, Malia and Sasha's $17,990 and $19,990 (respectively) gowns caused a bit of a controversy. A news anchor in San Fransisco criticized the price tag — and some conservative media outlets even claimed the gowns were purchased using tax payer dollars. It was a facetious claim, considering that most industry insiders are well aware that political figures — including Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton and Melania Trump — either purchase their clothing with their own money, or wear it on loan from a designer. As the White House press department later explained, in Sasha and Malia's case, the dresses were indeed on loan from the designer. The media outrage was completely unwarranted — and by immortalizing their looks in this year's Christmas card, the Obama girls certainly had the last laugh. In fact, it may be the classiest comeback ever.\nWith this card, they inspire us to remember the State Dinner as a special moment for their family, and a perfectly appropriate occasion for gowns of that caliber. At the end of the day, we can only sum this card up with one word: iconic.\n**Related:** \n**Check this out:**\n]\n is a journalist and the author of “Worn Out: How Our Clothes Cover Up Fashion’s Sins.” She was formerly the Fashion News Editor at Teen Vogue and the Senior News Editor at InStyle.

The “issue” concerns the fact that their embroidered appliqué gowns cost an estimated $20,000 apiece.\n**** magazine noted that the guiding principle seemed to be “princess moment,” as both girls selected super-romantic gowns from the designer’s recent collections.\nMalia, 17, chose a simple, sophisticated blush gown with a sweetheart neckline and all over crystal beading, which once retailed on Moda Operandi for $17,990. Sasha, 14, went for something a little bolder, deciding on a beaded lace and appliqué ball gown in shades of cranberry, turquoise, black and beige; it formerly sold for $19,990.\nThe uproar over the girls’ dresses began after **Kristen Sze**, an ABC News anchor in San Francisco, criticized the First Family in a since-deleted tweet for allowing the girls to wear the expensive dresses. She later apologized:\nBut it wasn’t deleted before Black Twitter could respond:\nIt was not the first time the girls have become ensnared in the politics of criticism.\nIn 2014, they were criticized for wearing short skirts and looking disinterested at the White House Turkey Pardon. _“Act like being in the White House matters to you,”_ GOP staffer Elizabeth Lauten said in a Facebook post. _“Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at the bar.

The First Family welcomed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, to the White House. It was the first U.S. visit for a Canadian prime minister in nearly two decades. Photo by Pete Souza\nSasha and Malia Obama, the teenage daughters of President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, were nothing less than stunning for their first state dinner, where they were first clad in designer fabrics and later in controversy.\nDuring the official White House event last Thursday night welcoming Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, both Sasha and Malia ruled the red carpet, rubbed elbows with dignitaries and enjoyed a rare star-struck moment with “Deadpool” star Ryan Reynolds.\nUnfortunately, heated discussions centering on the girls attire have arisen, marring the First Family’s historic evening. The issue arose when Kristen Sze, an ABC network news anchor in San Francisco, commented about the price of the girls’ gowns.\nMs. Sze called the gowns, which ranged in price from $17,000 to $20,000, “too expensive for such young girls.” She further fueled the discussion by asking her Twitter followers if they would pay that price for dresses for their teenagers.\nBlack Twitter took to the Twittersphere in defense of the girls, hitting back with comments like, “Better question: Is your mom The First Lady? No? Your opinion is irrelevant.”\nThe First Family has been characteristically unfazed by the subsequent gown discussion. Joanna Rosholm, press secretary to the First Lady, released this statement in the past about Mrs. Obama’s wardrobe:\n“And for the record, the government isn’t paying for any of the first family’s wardrobe.

The “issue” concerns the fact that their embroidered appliqué gowns cost an estimated $20,000 apiece.\n**** magazine noted that the guiding principle seemed to be “princess moment,” as both girls selected super-romantic gowns from the designer’s recent collections.\nMalia, 17, chose a simple, sophisticated blush gown with a sweetheart neckline and all over crystal beading, which once retailed on Moda Operandi for $17,990. Sasha, 14, went for something a little bolder, deciding on a beaded lace and appliqué ball gown in shades of cranberry, turquoise, black and beige; it formerly sold for $19,990.\nThe uproar over the girls’ dresses began after **Kristen Sze**, an ABC News anchor in San Francisco, criticized the First Family in a since-deleted tweet for allowing the girls to wear the expensive dresses. She later apologized:\nBut it wasn’t deleted before Black Twitter could respond:\nIt was not the first time the girls have become ensnared in the politics of criticism.\nIn 2014, they were criticized for wearing short skirts and looking disinterested at the White House Turkey Pardon. _“Act like being in the White House matters to you,”_ GOP staffer Elizabeth Lauten said in a Facebook post. _“Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at the bar. And certainly don’t make faces at televised, public events.”_\nBut what’s so interesting is that back in 2001, there was no criticizing from White House staffers when President **George W.

The First Family welcomed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, to the White House. It was the first U.S. visit for a Canadian prime minister in nearly two decades. Photo by Pete Souza\nSasha and Malia Obama, the teenage daughters of President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, were nothing less than stunning for their first state dinner, where they were first clad in designer fabrics and later in controversy.\nDuring the official White House event last Thursday night welcoming Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, both Sasha and Malia ruled the red carpet, rubbed elbows with dignitaries and enjoyed a rare star-struck moment with “Deadpool” star Ryan Reynolds.\nUnfortunately, heated discussions centering on the girls attire have arisen, marring the First Family’s historic evening. The issue arose when Kristen Sze, an ABC network news anchor in San Francisco, commented about the price of the girls’ gowns.\nMs. Sze called the gowns, which ranged in price from $17,000 to $20,000, “too expensive for such young girls.” She further fueled the discussion by asking her Twitter followers if they would pay that price for dresses for their teenagers.\nBlack Twitter took to the Twittersphere in defense of the girls, hitting back with comments like, “Better question: Is your mom The First Lady? No? Your opinion is irrelevant.”\nThe First Family has been characteristically unfazed by the subsequent gown discussion. Joanna Rosholm, press secretary to the First Lady, released this statement in the past about Mrs. Obama’s wardrobe:\n“And for the record, the government isn’t paying for any of the first family’s wardrobe. Mrs. Obama pays for her clothing. For official events of public...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "Did the video mention that Sasha and Malia Obama's state dinner dresses cost over $40,000?",
        "Answer": "The video did not mention that Sasha and Malia Obama's state dinner dresses cost over $40,000. Instead, the evidence suggests that each dress was estimated to cost around $20,000. According to reports, the gowns that Malia and Sasha wore to their first State Dinner were valued between $17,990 and $19,990, which does not add up to the claim of over $40,000 for both dresses combined. Furthermore, the video transcript focused on other ethical issues around presidential gifts and did not specifically address the costs of the dresses worn by the Obama's daughters.",
