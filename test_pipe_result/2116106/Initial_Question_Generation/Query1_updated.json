This year marks the Obamas' last Christmas card as the first family (_tear_) so they really wanted to bring it home in style. They chose an image from the Canada State Dinner this past Spring, when the whole family was dressed to the nines. First Lady Michelle stunned in a strapless dress by Jason Wu while President Obama chose a classic tuxedo.  looked resplendent on the arms of their parents, both in gowns by Naeem Khan.\n#### Instagram content\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it  from.\nAround the time the photo was taken, Malia and Sasha's $17,990 and $19,990 (respectively) gowns caused a bit of a controversy. A news anchor in San Fransisco criticized the price tag \u2014 and some conservative media outlets even claimed the gowns were purchased using tax payer dollars. It was a facetious claim, considering that most industry insiders are well aware that political figures \u2014 including Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton and Melania Trump \u2014 either purchase their clothing with their own money, or wear it on loan from a designer. As the White House press department later explained, in Sasha and Malia's case, the dresses were indeed on loan from the designer. The media outrage was completely unwarranted \u2014 and by immortalizing their looks in this year's Christmas card, the Obama girls certainly had the last laugh. In fact, it may be the classiest comeback ever.\nWith this card, they inspire us to remember the State Dinner as a special moment for their family, and a perfectly appropriate occasion for gowns of that caliber. At the end of the day, we can only sum this card up with one word: iconic.\n**Related:** \n**Check this out:**\n]\n is a journalist and the author of \u201cWorn Out: How Our Clothes Cover Up Fashion\u2019s Sins.\u201d She was formerly the Fashion News Editor at Teen Vogue and the Senior News Editor at InStyle.

It\u2019s no wonder Barack has such a tight grip on his daughter in that photo.\nWe are in a strange time when a slew of actresses 15 years of age or younger who have become style stars seem to constantly redefine age-appropriate dressing for young teens and preteens. Hailee Steinfeld, who is now 15, became the face of Miu Miu at just 14 years old, having cemented her fashion credibility by earning copious praise for wearing  that would have been difficult for most adults to pull off to the SAG awards this year. In her company is Chloe Moretz, 14, who regularly wears runway looks by the likes of , , and . There\u2019s also Elle Fanning, who at 13 has , and counts among her favorite labels , , and Rodarte (at 12 years old, Fanning was ).\nBut unlike Sasha and Malia, these young women are building careers around their fashion-forward image, probably angling for a spot in the same sphere of influence as someone like two-time _Vogue_ cover girl and Chanel face Blake Lively. And even as they do that, their efforts to solidify a commitment to fashion feels strange at times, in the same way it feels strange when 15-year-old models snatch up so many slots in runway shows and ad campaigns for some of the world\u2019s most expensive labels, neither a new phenomenon nor debate. Do designers really think of clothes with three-, four-, or five-figure price tags as child\u2019s play? And what does their affinity for this age group say about the customers who want to buy their things?\nUnlike these young actresses (and their mother Michelle, even), Sasha and Malia are not posing for fashion magazines or endorsing certain labels. They are not going around town in Chanel. And they would probably benefit from the press not placing too much emphasis on their image since being an involuntarily famous young woman these days, when no one can be the right weight or consistently wear enough of the right things, is hard enough as it is. After all, those who are praised will inevitably be criticized, and do we really want to set them up for that? Of course we\u2019ll coo over them when they meet the world\u2019s most famous pop stars, but holding them up as an example of how to wear the hot new color on the runways is simply unnecessary \u2014 \u00a0we have plenty of other famous people who, by choosing their roles in the public eye, volunteer for that kind of criticism.\nSasha and Malia Obama: Kids or Fashion Plates?",
