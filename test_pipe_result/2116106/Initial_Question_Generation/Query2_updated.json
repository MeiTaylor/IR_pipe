The First Family welcomed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau, to the White House. It was the first U.S. visit for a Canadian prime minister in nearly two decades. Photo by Pete Souza\nSasha and Malia Obama, the teenage daughters of President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, were nothing less than stunning for their first state dinner, where they were first clad in designer fabrics and later in controversy.\nDuring the official White House event last Thursday night welcoming Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, both Sasha and Malia ruled the red carpet, rubbed elbows with dignitaries and enjoyed a rare star-struck moment with \u201cDeadpool\u201d star Ryan Reynolds.\nUnfortunately, heated discussions centering on the girls attire have arisen, marring the First Family\u2019s historic evening.

No? Your opinion is irrelevant.\u201d\nThe First Family has been characteristically unfazed by the subsequent gown discussion. Joanna Rosholm, press secretary to the First Lady, released this statement in the past about Mrs. Obama\u2019s wardrobe:\n\u201cAnd for the record, the government isn\u2019t paying for any of the first family\u2019s wardrobe.

The \u201cissue\u201d concerns the fact that their embroidered appliqu\u00e9 gowns cost an estimated $20,000 apiece.\n**** magazine noted that the guiding principle seemed to be \u201cprincess moment,\u201d as both girls selected super-romantic gowns from the designer\u2019s recent collections.\nMalia, 17, chose a simple, sophisticated blush gown with a sweetheart neckline and all over crystal beading, which once retailed on Moda Operandi for $17,990. Sasha, 14, went for something a little bolder, deciding on a beaded lace and appliqu\u00e9 ball gown in shades of cranberry, turquoise, black and beige; it formerly sold for $19,990.\nThe uproar over the girls\u2019 dresses began after\u00a0**Kristen Sze**, an ABC News anchor in San Francisco, criticized the First Family in a since-deleted tweet for allowing the girls to wear the expensive dresses. She later apologized:\nBut it wasn\u2019t deleted before Black Twitter could respond:\nIt was not the first time the girls have become ensnared in the politics of criticism.\nIn 2014, they were criticized for wearing short skirts and looking disinterested at the White House Turkey Pardon. _\u201cAct like being in the White House matters to you,\u201d_ GOP staffer Elizabeth Lauten said in a Facebook post. _\u201cDress like you deserve respect, not a spot at the bar.

This year marks the Obamas' last Christmas card as the first family (_tear_) so they really wanted to bring it home in style. They chose an image from the Canada State Dinner this past Spring, when the whole family was dressed to the nines. First Lady Michelle stunned in a strapless dress by Jason Wu while President Obama chose a classic tuxedo.  looked resplendent on the arms of their parents, both in gowns by Naeem Khan.\n#### Instagram content\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it  from.\nAround the time the photo was taken, Malia and Sasha's $17,990 and $19,990 (respectively) gowns caused a bit of a controversy. A news anchor in San Fransisco criticized the price tag \u2014 and some conservative media outlets even claimed the gowns were purchased using tax payer dollars. It was a facetious claim, considering that most industry insiders are well aware that political figures \u2014 including Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton and Melania Trump \u2014 either purchase their clothing with their own money, or wear it on loan from a designer. As the White House press department later explained, in Sasha and Malia's case, the dresses were indeed on loan from the designer. The media outrage was completely unwarranted \u2014 and by immortalizing their looks in this year's Christmas card, the Obama girls certainly had the last laugh. In fact, it may be the classiest comeback ever.\nWith this card, they inspire us to remember the State Dinner as a special moment for their family, and a perfectly appropriate occasion for gowns of that caliber. At the end of the day, we can only sum this card up with one word: iconic.\n**Related:** \n**Check this out:**\n]\n is a journalist and the author of \u201cWorn Out: How Our Clothes Cover Up Fashion\u2019s...[Content truncated]",

That\u2019s everyone except a San Francisco ABC news anchor. Kristen Sze took to Twitter to share her disdain for the hefty price tag of Sasha\u2019s gorgoeus gown. Soon after Sze\u2019s tweet, both her mentions and the timeline were full of reactions on her completely unneccessary commentary. ****\n> Better question: Is your mom The First Lady? No? Well, STFU, your opinion is irrelevant. https://t.co/5QwG68vAv6\n> \n> \u2014 Disney Villain (@carlettaisgreat) \n> Is Sasha Obama, a whole president\u2019s daughter, supposed to wear a Children\u2019s Place dress to the State Dinner because she\u2019s 14?\n> \n> \u2014 clyde davis (@thefentybarb) \n> The teens we\u2019d want to represent America, Sasha & Malia, go to ONE fancy dinner, in 8 years, wearing a fancy dress, and it\u2019s a problem.\n> \n> \u2014 Melissa & Stuff (@fabglance1)...[Content truncated]",
