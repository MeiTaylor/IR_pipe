        "video_transcript": "I'm Eamon Javers in Washington. You know the first lady's clothes aren't the only ethical issue that the White House faces in terms of accepting gifts. The president himself receives gifts all the time from foreign heads of state and other dignitaries. Those gifts are typically given over to the national archives and the White House lists all the gifts that the president receives in the federal register. The reason that the US government actually keeps the gifts is almost always disclosed in the federal register as in a line item that says non acceptance would cause embarrassment to the donor and to the US government. And that opens the door to a lot of presidential swag including some of these items that we saw listed in this year's listing. A large black Hermes golf accessory bag from French president Sarkozy valued at $7,750. The disposition of that was to the national archives. A 48 inch bronze statue of Abraham Lincoln from Chinese president Hu Jintao, $9,800 also went to the national archives. A 30 inch circumference gold and silver base with silver statue of 2 wild goats from the emir of Qatar valued at $3,200 also went to the national archives. In fact, the only item that I could find in a quick scan that the president actually kept for himself was a book called Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World. That was from the president of Mongolia. The book was personally retained, the federal register says. The White House now doesn't list a value for it in the listing, but I found it on Amazon dotcom for $9.23 in paperback. And another item that wasn't sent directly to the National Archives, archives, a small sword from the attorney general of Qatar valued at 3 $150. That sword, the federal register says, was handled pursuant to US Secret Service policy.",
        "Video_descriptor": "The video opens with a man in a suit and tie addressing the camera directly, setting a formal tone. Transitioning to a newsroom environment, the man is now seen standing in front of multiple screens displaying various news segments, with the distinct 'CNBC WASHINGTON' logo in the background. The busy newsroom setting suggests a professional broadcasting atmosphere. In subsequent frames, the man continues his broadcast, maintaining a focused demeanor while presenting news updates. His attire remains consistent throughout, reflecting the seriousness of the news delivery. As the video progresses, the man is shown in different locations within the newsroom, interacting with computers and television screens, suggesting a dynamic news reporting environment. The presence of other broadcasting personnel in the background adds to the authenticity of the newsroom scenario. The continuous back-and-forth between the man speaking to the camera and delivering news updates creates a sense of a live broadcast unfolding. The visuals consistently reinforce the idea of a news anchor in action, with each frame showcasing a professional and dedicated approach to news delivery. The video concludes with the man in the suit and tie summarizing his broadcast, wrapping up the news presentation with a final address to the camera, completing the full circle of a news reporting segment within a traditional newsroom setting. The video effectively captures the essence of a news broadcast, featuring a poised news anchor delivering updates in a bustling newsroom environment synonymous with professional journalism."

    "Initial_Question_Generation": {
        "Question": "Did the video mention that Sasha and Malia Obama's state dinner dresses cost over $40,000?",
        "Answer": "The video did not mention that Sasha and Malia Obama's state dinner dresses cost over $40,000. Instead, the evidence suggests that each dress was estimated to cost around $20,000. According to reports, the gowns that Malia and Sasha wore to their first State Dinner were valued between $17,990 and $19,990, which does not add up to the claim of over $40,000 for both dresses combined. Furthermore, the video transcript focused on other ethical issues around presidential gifts and did not specifically address the costs of the dresses worn by the Obama's daughters.",
        "Confidence": "95%"
    },
    "CVResult": {
        "Judgment": "Yes",
        "Confidence": "95%",
        "Reason": "The existing information is sufficient to determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding the cost of Sasha and Malia Obama's state dinner dresses. The video does not mention that the dresses cost over $40,000, but instead provides information that each dress was estimated to cost between $17,990 and $19,990. This contradicts the claim since the total estimated cost for both dresses is below the $40,000 threshold. Additionally, the answer in the QA_CONTEXTS clearly addresses the claim, providing specific breakdowns of the dress values that confirm the total does not exceed $40,000. Thus, the factual accuracy can be confidently determined based on the provided details."

    "Final_Judgement": {
        "Answer": "False",
        "Reasons": "The claim that taxpayers paid more than $40,000 for Sasha and Malia Obama's state dinner dresses is inaccurate. The video transcript suggests that each dress cost around $20,000, with specific values reported between $17,990 and $19,990, which does not reach the claimed amount of over $40,000 combined. Additionally, the video does not focus on the cost of the dresses but on other ethical issues surrounding presidential gifts, making the claim unsupported in this context. Therefore, this indicates that the information presented in the claim is incorrect as it contradicts the details found in the video transcript. [Initial_Question_Generation_Query 1_evidence1]",
