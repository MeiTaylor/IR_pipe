        "video_transcript": "I love the old days, you know? You know what I hate? There's a guy totally like this? They'd be carried out on a stretcher, folks. Like this? They'd be carried out on a stretcher, folks. That's true. You know, I love our police and I really respect our police and they're not getting enough. They're not. But Honestly, I hate to see that. Here's a guy throwing punches, nasty as hell, screaming at everything else when we're talking. And he walking out and we're not allowed, you know, the guards are very gentle with him. He's walking out like big high fives, smiling, laughing, Like to punch him in the face, I'll tell you.",
        "Video_descriptor": "The video captures several moments from a live political event featuring Donald Trump, where he is seen speaking passionately at a podium to a crowd of supporters wearing shirts emblazoned with 'TRUMP'. Various key frames show different angles of Trump addressing the crowd, gesturing with his hands, and engaging with the audience. The setting appears to be an indoor venue, likely a large hall or arena, filled with enthusiastic supporters. The backdrop includes banners and signs partially visible in the background, with live broadcast logos such as 'Right Side Broadcasting Network (RSBN)' and 'Fox News Live' indicating the event's coverage. The timestamps on the key frames suggest the event occurring at different times during the day, with the images reflecting a dynamic and engaged crowd listening to Trump's speech. These key frames collectively offer a snapshot of a lively and fervent political rally where Trump connects with his supporters in a spirited and energized atmosphere, showcasing his commanding presence and communication skills on stage."

    "CVResult": {
        "Judgment": "Yes",
        "Confidence": "90%",
        "Reason": "The existing information is sufficient to judge the truthfulness of the claim. In the video transcript, Donald Trump explicitly states, 'I love the old days... They'd be carried out on a stretcher, folks.' This directly supports the claim that he mentioned protesters being harshly dealt with and carried away on stretchers. The context of him expressing disdain for the current treatment of protesters, contrasting it with previous treatment, further strengthens this point. Thus, the data provides a clear basis for confirming the claim's truthfulness."

    "Final_Judgement": {
        "Answer": "False",
        "Reasons": "In the video, Donald Trump does not explicitly state that protesters were harshly dealt with and carried away on stretchers in the sense of them being harmed or forcibly removed. Instead, he reflects on the past with a suggestion that protesters would not be treated gently, and remarks that they would be carried away on stretchers, implying he would prefer a more aggressive response towards them. However, this doesn't mean he stated that they were actually dealt with in that manner at the time. His remarks could easily be interpreted as hyperbolic or as a commentary on his preferences, rather than an accurate description of past events. Therefore, the interpretation of his words as a factual representation of past treatment of protesters is misleading and not supported directly by the video content.",
        "Therefore, the Claim authenticity is": "False",
        "The information type is": "False",
        "The specific type of False Information is": "Text unsupported by the video."
