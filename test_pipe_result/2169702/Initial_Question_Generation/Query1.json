Sometimes its frozen solid, sometimes it stays liquid, depending on when I put it in there. But here’s the kicker, sometimes I will pull the bottle out, it will be liquid, but as soon as I open it, it starts to turn into ice, from the top down (it takes a few seconds for the entire bottle to freeze. Is there an explanation for this?  \n\\- Greg (age 26)  \nArmy, Iraq\nA:\nWe suspect that what’s happening here is that the water in the bottles which did not freeze overnight was \"supercooled.\" Water normally freezes when it is cooled below 0 degrees Celsius, forming ice crystals. Ice crystals form more easily when they grow on existing ice crystals -- the water molecules like to pack themselves in place on a crystal that’s already gotten started. It doesn’t take much to start the crystallization process going -- a little piece of dust or other impurity in the water, or even a scratch on the bottle are sometimes all it takes to get ice crystals growing. The process of starting off a crystal is called \"nucleation.\"\nIn the absence of impurities in the water and imperfections in the bottle, the water can get \"stuck\" in its liquid state as it cools off, even below its freezing point. We say this supercooled state is \"metastable.\" The water will stay liquid until something comes along to nucleate crystal growth. A speck of dust, or a flake of frost from the screw-cap falling into the bottle are enough to get the freezing going, and the crystals will build on each other and spread through the water in the bottle.\nWater releases 80 calories per gram when turning from a liquid to a solid. We suspect your freezer is only a few degrees Celsius below zero(perhaps ten or fifteen?), and the specific heat of water is one calorie per degree per gram. This means that your water, as it freezes, warms up the rest of the water until the process stops at 0...[Content truncated]",

Actually, there is a period _between_ water turning from liquid to solid that can happen before your eyes! This super cool transition is known as **supercooling water**.\nSupercooled water is water that remains in its liquid state far below the freezing point. But in order for this to work, the water must be _very_ purified so that the impurities in the water don’t create a place for crystallization to occur.\nEssentially, the arrangement of molecules in water determines its state of matter. When the molecules are not touching and flowing freely, the water is liquid. When the molecules come together and lock into place, it becomes a solid, or ice.\nSince this occurs naturally in impure water, we must initiate the nucleation process (the first step of crystallization) to observe the supercooling process. That’s where the fun part comes in! Disturbing the molecules by shaking, pouring, or banging on a surface is the catalyst to the crystallization process.\nAre you ready to try to supercool your own water? ThoughtCo. recommends  to try to observe this amazing phenomenon:\n**Supercool Bottled Water  \n**\n1.  Place an unopened bottle of purified water (Fiji is a reliable brand) in the freezer undisturbed.\n2.  After two and a half hours, carefully remove the supercooled water from the freezer.\n3.  Initiate crystallization by either shaking the bottle or opening it and pouring the supercooled water over a piece of ice.\n**Supercool Water in a Glass  \n**\n1.  Pour about two tablespoons of purified water into a clean glass.\n2.  Place the filled glass into a bowl of ice. Make sure the level of ice is higher than the level of water in the glass!\n3.  Sprinkle a few tablespoons of salt onto the ice, carefully as to not get any salt in the water.\n4.  Wait 15 minutes for the water to cool below the freezing point, thus becoming supercooled.\n5.  Initiate the process by either pouring it over a piece of ice or dropping a piece of ice into the glass. \nThe process of supercooling water shows just how amazing H2O is. Watching science occur before our very eyes is a rare occurrence. Water truly is super cool!",

As per the established international definition, supercooling means ‘cooling a substance below the normal freezing point without solidification’ [4][5] While it can be achieved by different physical means, the postponed solidification is most often due to the absence of seed crystals or nuclei around which a crystal structure can form. The supercooling of water can be achieved without any special techniques other than chemical demineralization, down to −48.3 °C (−54.9 °F). Supercooled water can occur naturally, for example in the atmosphere, animals or plants.\n\nA liquid crossing its standard freezing point will crystalize in the presence of a seed crystal or nucleus around which a crystal structure can form creating a solid. Lacking any such nuclei, the liquid phase can be maintained all the way down to the temperature at which crystal homogeneous nucleation occurs.[6]\n\nHomogeneous nucleation can occur above the glass transition temperature, but if homogeneous nucleation has not occurred above that temperature, an amorphous (non-crystalline) solid will form.\n\nWater normally freezes at 273.15 K (0.0 °C; 32 °F), but...[Content truncated]",

For example, why is ice less dense than water, floating rather than sinking the way other liquids do when they freeze?\nNow a new study provides strong evidence for a controversial theory that at very cold temperatures water can exist in two distinct liquid forms, one being less dense and more structured than the other.\nResearchers at Princeton University and Sapienza University of Rome conducted computer simulations of water molecules to discover the critical point at which one liquid phase transforms into the other. The study was published this week in the journal Science. \n“The presence of the critical point provides a very simple explanation for water’s oddities,” said Princeton’s Dean for Research Pablo Debenedetti, the Class of 1950 Professor in Engineering and Applied Science, and professor of chemical and biological engineering. “The finding of the critical point is equivalent to finding a good, simple explanation for the many things that make water odd, especially at low temperatures.”\nWater’s oddities include that as water cools, it expands rather than contracting, which is why frozen water is less dense than liquid water.

Research into the effects of cryopreservation on live tissue had its roots in late 1800s when scientists used this technology to preserve both spermatozoa and red blood cells (RBCs). During this time, research demonstrated weaknesses in the process which caused inconsistent results and frequent infertility caused by early embryonic death. A breakthrough occurred in the 1950s when James Lovelock discovered that the cryopreservation process caused osmotic stress in the cell by instantly freezing the liquid which directly contributed to the formation of ice crystals in RBCs. In 1963, Mazur was able to characterize that process when they demonstrated that the rate of temperature change within a cell-containing medium controlled the movement of water across a cell membrane and thus the degree of intracellular freezing. This together helped to improve the overall understanding of the mechanism associated with the cryoprotective process. During the 1980s, research surrounding the cryopreservation process revealed that the speed at which the freezing and thawing process occurred was the most important factor in determining the survivability of the cells,. It was demonstrated that small, slow increments in both the freezing and thawing processes prevented the rapid formation of ice crystals that increased membrane-bound solutes associated with early cell death. Another initial advance in cryopreservation occurred in the late 1940s when researchers discovered that the use of glycerol as a medium increased the survivability of spermatozoa in subfreezing (−70ºC) temperatures. Using glycerol as a medium effectively served to protect the cells from rapid formation of ice crystal during the preservation process. A commonly used cryoprotective agent currently employed is dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which is added to cell media prior to the freezing process,. DMSO (10%) when added to the cell media, commonly at 2 M concentration, increases the porosity of the cellular membrane, which allows water to flow more freely through the membrane,. Additionally, like glycerol, DMSO is thought to help prevent the formation of water crystals by increasing intracellular solute concentration, thus aiding in the vitrification of water at low temperatures.\n### Principles of Cryopreservation\nIn order to...[Content truncated]",

Thoroughly \nunderstanding the concept of sublimation is a key building block \nto gaining knowledge of freeze-drying. \nSublimation is a phase change and heat energy must be added \nto the frozen product for it to occur.

Rachel Brazil dives into the ongoing debate\nWater, the most commonplace of liquids, is also the strangest. It has at least 66 properties that differ from most liquids – high surface tension, high heat capacity, high melting and boiling points and low compressibility. One school of thought is that water is not a complicated liquid but ‘two simple liquids with a complicated relationship’. For some, this statement contradicts the basic principles of physical chemistry; for others it explains just why water behaves in such an anomalous way.\nOver the last decade the academic arguments have reached boiling point. ‘[It’s] bringing out very strong, almost religious opinions among different scientists,’ says Anders Nilsson, a chemical physicist with appointments at Stockholm University in Sweden and Stanford University in the US. Chemists have attributed water’s strange properties to the tetrahedrally arranged hydrogen-bonding networks that it forms, but exactly what is going on, particularly when water is in a supercooled state, is still up for debate.\nLike many other chemists, Nilsson assumed earlier in his career that the structure of water was well understood, but started to realise that was not the case. For the last 10 years he has concentrated on understanding water’s extraordinary behaviour and his recent work adds weight to the theory that water isn’t one liquid, but two distinct separate liquid structures that can coexist – an idea that is still controversial.\nIt’s a lot of hydrogen bonding for such a small molecule\n‘If you look at the simple thermodynamic and kinetic properties of liquids, as you change pressure and temperature, they all behave the same way,’ explains Nilsson. As you cool a liquid, its density increases, and its heat capacity and compressibility decrease. ‘Almost all liquids on the planet behave like that. Except for water.’ This strangeness comes into focus as water is cooled to 4°C, where its density reaches a maximum, below which it starts...[Content truncated]",

Muhammad 🛡\nFollow\n--\nListen\nShare\nCloud seeding is a form of weather modification that has been used for decades to increase precipitation in areas experiencing drought or water scarcity. It involves the introduction of substances, such as silver iodide or dry ice, into clouds to stimulate the formation of ice crystals and ultimately, rain or snow.\nThe process of cloud seeding begins with identifying suitable clouds for seeding. These are typically cumulus clouds, which are large, fluffy clouds that have the potential to produce precipitation. Once a suitable cloud is identified, an aircraft equipped with a cloud seeding generator flies into the cloud and releases the seeding agent.\nThe most commonly used seeding agent is silver iodide, which has a similar structure to ice crystals and can act as a nucleus for the formation of larger ice crystals. The silver iodide particles attract water molecules, causing them to freeze and grow in size. As these ice crystals become larger and heavier, they fall from the cloud as precipitation.\nThe science behind cloud seeding lies in the principle of supercooling. Supercooled water droplets exist in clouds at temperatures below freezing but remain in liquid form due to the absence of particles for nucleation. By introducing silver iodide particles into these supercooled clouds, the droplets freeze and grow in size until they are heavy enough to fall as precipitation.\nAdditionally, cloud seeding can also work by increasing the number of ice nuclei present in a cloud. This leads to a higher concentration of ice crystals and increases the likelihood of precipitation formation. The seeding agent can also help to increase the efficiency of precipitation formation, resulting in larger and more frequent rain or snowfall.\nWhile cloud seeding has been used successfully in some areas, its effectiveness is still a topic of debate. Some studies have shown that cloud seeding can increase precipitation by 10–15%, while others have found no significant impact. The success of cloud seeding also depends on various factors such as the type of clouds, weather conditions, and location.\nThere are also concerns about the potential environmental impact of cloud seeding. The introduction of foreign particles into clouds may have unintended consequences on the ecosystem and...[Content truncated]",
