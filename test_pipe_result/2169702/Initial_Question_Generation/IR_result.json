                "content": "When water reaches its freezing point, 32 degrees Fahrenheit, it becomes ice… right? Actually, there is a period _between_ water turning from liquid to solid that can happen before your eyes! This super cool transition is known as **supercooling water**.\nSupercooled water is water that remains in its liquid state far below the freezing point. But in order for this to work, the water must be _very_ purified so that the impurities in the water don’t create a place for crystallization to occur.\nEssentially, the arrangement of molecules in water determines its state of matter. When the molecules are not touching and flowing freely, the water is liquid. When the molecules come together and lock into place, it becomes a solid, or ice.\nSince this occurs naturally in impure water, we must initiate the nucleation process (the first step of crystallization) to observe the supercooling process. That’s where the fun part comes in! Disturbing the molecules by shaking, pouring, or banging on a surface is the catalyst to the crystallization process.\nAre you ready to try to supercool your own water? ThoughtCo. recommends  to try to observe this amazing phenomenon:\n**Supercool Bottled Water  \n**\n1.  Place an unopened bottle of purified water (Fiji is a reliable brand) in the freezer undisturbed.\n2.  After two and a half hours, carefully remove the supercooled water from the freezer.\n3.  Initiate crystallization by either shaking the bottle or opening it and pouring the supercooled water over a piece of ice.\n**Supercool Water in a Glass  \n**\n1.  Pour about two tablespoons of purified water into a clean glass.\n2.  Place the filled glass into a bowl of ice. Make sure the level of ice is higher than the level of water in the glass!\n3.  Sprinkle a few tablespoons of salt onto the ice, carefully as to not get any salt in the water.\n4.  Wait 15 minutes for the water to cool below the freezing point, thus becoming supercooled.\n5.  Initiate the process by either pouring it over a piece of ice or dropping a piece of ice into the glass. \nThe process of supercooling water shows just how amazing H2O is. Watching science occur before our very eyes is a rare occurrence. Water truly is super cool!",

There are many videos on YouTube that describe this phenomenon, and explain it much better than I could, see  for a Veritasum video where this is discussed for example.\nThe basic idea is this: when water freezes it forms ice, which is a nice regular crystalline structure. However, ice-crystals need a _nucleation site_, which is a point where the crystal can _start_ to form, before they can actually start to form. In normal situations, water usually has some impurities which can serve as such nucleation sites, around which the crystal starts to grow and ice starts to form.\nHowever, if you use very pure water, there are no such \"natural\" nucleation points and so there is a chance that the water molecules want to form ice, but can't quite get around to it. As a result, the liquids are trapped in a \"metastable\" state well below their freezing point, but such a state has a precarious stability that can easily be disturbed. Shaking the bottle is one way to disturb this stability, as it gives a couple of the water molecules the chance to align in just to right way to start the crystallisation process, and once it's done, it is energetically favourable for the system to form ice, so all the other water molecules hop on as well. As a result, you would usually see the crystal \"growing\" in one direction until all the water becomes ice.\nOf course, you don't need to shake it, you could just introduce a different type of nucleation point as can be seen in this  and it would produce the same results, or alternatively, you could very carefully pour the supercooled water on top of an ice cube and form a sort of ice sculpture (see ).\nIt takes more energy to form supercooled water than ice, meaning that when the water transitions to ice...[Content truncated]",

            "content": "Supercooling,[1] also known as undercooling,[2][3] is the process of lowering the temperature of a liquid below its freezing point without it becoming a solid. As per the established international definition, supercooling means ‘cooling a substance below the normal freezing point without solidification’ [4][5] While it can be achieved by different physical means, the postponed solidification is most often due to the absence of seed crystals or nuclei around which a crystal structure can form. The supercooling of water can be achieved without any special techniques other than chemical demineralization, down to −48.3 °C (−54.9 °F). Supercooled water can occur naturally, for example in the atmosphere, animals or plants.\n\nA liquid crossing its standard freezing point will crystalize in the presence of a seed crystal or nucleus around which a crystal structure can form creating a solid. Lacking any such nuclei, the liquid phase can be maintained all the way down to the temperature at which crystal homogeneous nucleation occurs.[6]\n\nHomogeneous nucleation can occur above the glass transition temperature, but if homogeneous nucleation has not occurred above that temperature, an amorphous (non-crystalline) solid will form.\n\nWater normally freezes at 273.15 K (0.0 °C; 32 °F), but...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What scientific principles explain the transition of supercooled water to ice?",
        "Answer": "The transition of supercooled water to ice can be explained by several scientific principles:\n\n1. **Supercooling**: Supercooled water is water that has been cooled below its normal freezing point of 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) without becoming solid. This phenomenon occurs because supercooled water lacks impurities or nucleation sites, which are typically necessary for ice crystals to form. When water is free of these nucleation sites, it can remain in a liquid state as its temperature drops significantly, even down to -48.3 degrees Celsius (-54.9 degrees Fahrenheit) [Query 2_evidence2].\n\n2. **Nucleation**: For ice to form, a process called nucleation must occur. Nucleation is the initial step in the phase transition where small clusters of molecules come together to form a stable crystal structure. It can happen when a speck of dust, an impurity, or even vibrations (such as a jolt to the bottle) is introduced into supercooled water, providing the necessary site for crystal growth to begin. This process is essential because, without any nucleation sites, supercooled water can remain liquid even well below its freezing point [Query 1_evidence1].\n\n3. **Release of Energy**: When supercooled water finally transitions to ice, latent heat is released. As water freezes, it releases approximately 80 calories of energy per gram. This release of energy occurs as the water molecules arrange into the solid structure of ice, which involves a significant rearrangement of their molecular bonds [Query 1_evidence1].\n\n4. **Molecular Structure**: At lower temperatures, the molecular structure of water undergoes changes that influence its ability to remain liquid. Research has shown that at extremely low temperatures, water molecules transition into a structure that can facilitate freezing, but only upon the right conditions being met, such as the introduction of impurities that aid crystal formation [Query 2_evidence1].\n\nIn summary, the transition of supercooled water to ice is primarily governed by the principles of supercooling and nucleation, as well as the energy dynamics involved in phase transitions and the molecular changes that occur at low temperatures.",
