Actually, there is a period _between_ water turning from liquid to solid that can happen before your eyes! This super cool transition is known as **supercooling water**.\nSupercooled water is water that remains in its liquid state far below the freezing point. But in order for this to work, the water must be _very_ purified so that the impurities in the water don’t create a place for crystallization to occur.\nEssentially, the arrangement of molecules in water determines its state of matter. When the molecules are not touching and flowing freely, the water is liquid. When the molecules come together and lock into place, it becomes a solid, or ice.\nSince this occurs naturally in impure water, we must initiate the nucleation process (the first step of crystallization) to observe the supercooling process. That’s where the fun part comes in! Disturbing the molecules by shaking, pouring, or banging on a surface is the catalyst to the crystallization process.\nAre you ready to try to supercool your own water? ThoughtCo. recommends  to try to observe this amazing phenomenon:\n**Supercool Bottled Water  \n**\n1.  Place an unopened bottle of purified water (Fiji is a reliable brand) in the freezer undisturbed.\n2.  After two and a half hours, carefully remove the supercooled water from the freezer.\n3.  Initiate crystallization by either shaking the bottle or opening it and pouring the supercooled water over a piece of ice.\n**Supercool Water in a Glass  \n**\n1.  Pour about two tablespoons of purified water into a clean glass.\n2.  Place the filled glass into a bowl of ice. Make sure the level of ice is higher than the level of water in the glass!\n3.  Sprinkle a few tablespoons of salt onto the ice, carefully as to not get any salt in the water.\n4.  Wait 15 minutes for the water to cool below the freezing point, thus becoming supercooled.\n5.  Initiate the process by either pouring it over a piece of ice or dropping a piece of ice into the glass. \nThe process of supercooling water shows just how amazing H2O is. Watching science occur before our very eyes is a rare occurrence. Water truly is super cool!",

As per the established international definition, supercooling means ‘cooling a substance below the normal freezing point without solidification’ [4][5] While it can be achieved by different physical means, the postponed solidification is most often due to the absence of seed crystals or nuclei around which a crystal structure can form. The supercooling of water can be achieved without any special techniques other than chemical demineralization, down to −48.3 °C (−54.9 °F). Supercooled water can occur naturally, for example in the atmosphere, animals or plants.\n\nA liquid crossing its standard freezing point will crystalize in the presence of a seed crystal or nucleus around which a crystal structure can form creating a solid. Lacking any such nuclei, the liquid phase can be maintained all the way down to the temperature at which crystal homogeneous nucleation occurs.[6]\n\nHomogeneous nucleation can occur above the glass transition temperature, but if homogeneous nucleation has not occurred above that temperature, an amorphous (non-crystalline) solid will form.\n\nWater normally freezes at 273.15 K (0.0 °C; 32 °F), but...[Content truncated]",

There are many videos on YouTube that describe this phenomenon, and explain it much better than I could, see  for a Veritasum video where this is discussed for example.\nThe basic idea is this: when water freezes it forms ice, which is a nice regular crystalline structure. However, ice-crystals need a _nucleation site_, which is a point where the crystal can _start_ to form, before they can actually start to form. In normal situations, water usually has some impurities which can serve as such nucleation sites, around which the crystal starts to grow and ice starts to form.\nHowever, if you use very pure water, there are no such \"natural\" nucleation points and so there is a chance that the water molecules want to form ice, but can't quite get around to it. As a result, the liquids are trapped in a \"metastable\" state well below their freezing point, but such a state has a precarious stability that can easily be disturbed. Shaking the bottle is one way to disturb this stability, as it gives a couple of the water molecules the chance to align in just to right way to start the crystallisation process, and once it's done, it is energetically favourable for the system to form ice, so all the other water molecules hop on as well. As a result, you would usually see the crystal \"growing\" in one direction until all the water becomes ice.\nOf course, you don't need to shake it, you could just introduce a different type of nucleation point as can be seen in this  and it would produce the same results, or alternatively, you could very carefully pour the supercooled water on top of an ice cube and form a sort of ice sculpture (see ).\nIt takes more energy to form supercooled water than ice, meaning that when the water transitions to ice...[Content truncated]",

You’ve actually done the experiment to show that oxygen is not the key. Shaking or dropping the bottle doesn’t add oxygen to it, but does trigger the slush formation.\nMike W.\n_(published on 10/22/2007)_\nFollow-Up #2: supercooled water\n-------------------------------\nQ:\nHow super cooled can water get without freezing? also i would just like to comment that i was searching for this answer because the same thing was happening to me here in iraq.  \n\\- Greg (age 24)  \nNavy, Iraq\nA:\nAccording to Wikipedia water can be supercooled to a little below -40°C, at least briefly. I suspect that in practice it will be hard to go below about -20°C, just because ordinary bottles, bubbles, dust, etc. can nucleate freezing. The number of people who have written about observing this is now pretty large, so it seems easier to get large supercooling than I'd guessed.\nMike W.\n_(published on 07/02/2008)_\nFollow-Up #3: supercooling observed\n-----------------------------------\nQ:\nThanks for the explanation! I observed this for the first time the other day, then reproduced it just to make sure it wasn't a fluke. Amazing and perplexing to watch the first time.  \n\\- Eric Ford (age 37)  \nMesa, Arizona, USA\nA:\nThanks for the info,\n_(published on 08/15/2008)_\nFollow-Up #4: pressure and supercooling\n---------------------------------------\nQ:\nHow is the freezing temperature of water affected by pressure? This phenomenon happened to me as well but I assumed supercooling was caused by the water in my water bottle being under a slight vacuum (the bottle was 'sucked in' when I put it in the freezer) and when I opened it the pressure change to atmospheric caused the phase change. Surprisingly I could not find a lot of data on the internet about this. My thermodynamic book has many property tables on superheated water vapor but little to say on the solid-liquid properties of water.  \n\\- garrett (age 26)  \nhouston, tx\nA:\nLiquid water and ice have only slightly different volumes, so the freezing point isn't very sensitive to pressure. To the extent that it is, higher pressure favors the liquid, which (somewhat unusually) has smaller volume. Since your bottle's pressure seemed to slightly rise when opened, that effect would actually tend to reduce freezing. However, it's a very small effect and in this case...[Content truncated]",

Baird, author of The Top 50 Science Questions with Surprising Answers and Associate Professor of Physics at West Texas A&M University\nYes, water can stay liquid below zero degrees Celsius. There are a few ways in which this can happen.\nFirst of all, the phase of a material (whether it is gas, liquid, or solid) depends strongly on both its temperature and pressure. For most liquids, applying pressure raises the temperature at which the liquid freezes to solid. A solid is formed when the loose, meandering molecules of a liquid get slow enough and close enough to form stable bonds that pin them in place. When we apply pressure to a liquid, we force the molecules to get closer together. They can therefore form stable bonds and become a solid even if they have a higher temperature than the freezing point at standard pressure. Water is somewhat unique, though. Water molecules spread out when they are bonding into a solid crystalline structure. This spreading-out action leads ice to be less dense than liquid water, causing ice to float. This spreading-out action of the water molecules during freezing also means that applying pressure to water lowers the freezing point. If you apply enough pressure (making it hard for the water molecules to spread out into the solid structure), you can have liquid water several degrees below zero degrees Celsius.\nEven if you don't apply pressure, you can still have liquid water at sub-zero temperatures using additives. Additives such as salt can interfere with the chemical bonding needed to form a solid and they therefore can lower water's freezing point. Salt is composed of strong sodium and chlorine ions. When dissolved in water, the water molecules tend to stick to the salt ions instead of to each other, and they therefore don't freeze as readily. As you add more salt to water, its freezing point continues to drop until the water reaches saturation and cannot hold any more salt. If you add enough salt, the freezing point of water can be dropped as low as -21 degrees Celsius. This fact means that water at -21 degrees...[Content truncated]",

Now, University of Utah chemists may have solved one enigma by showing how cold water can get before it absolutely must freeze: 48 degrees below zero Celsius (minus 55 Fahrenheit).\nThat's 48 degrees Celsius (87 degrees Fahrenheit) colder than what most people consider the freezing point of water, namely, 0 C (32 F).\nSupercooled liquid water must become ice at minus 48 C (minus 55 F) not just because of the extreme cold, but because the molecular structure of water changes physically to form tetrahedron shapes, with each water molecule loosely bonded to four others, according to the new study by chemists Valeria Molinero and Emily Moore.\nThe findings suggest this structural change from liquid to \"intermediate ice\" explains the mystery of \"what determines the temperature at which water is going to freeze,\" says Molinero, an assistant professor at the University of Utah and senior author of the study, published in the Nov. 24 issue of the journal _Nature_.\n\"This intermediate ice has a structure between the full structure of ice and the structure of the liquid,\" she adds. \"We're solving a very old puzzle of what is going on in deeply supercooled water.\"\nHowever, in the strange and wacky world of water, tiny amounts of liquid water theoretically still might be present even as temperatures plunge below minus 48 C (minus 55 F) and almost all the water has turned...[Content truncated]",

You can easily see water frozen in your freezer, and it spews as a gas from your kettle. But if you mess with these normal states, you can do some fun and strange things with something as everyday as water.\nWe’re all taught in school that water boils at 100°C and freezes at 0°C. This range was defined by a Swedish astronomer(!) called Anders Celsius when he devised  and which is also known as ‘centigrade’. It’s a very useful way of thinking about temperature\\.\nRather awesomely, there is a way to cool water below 0°C without it becoming ice. The process is called ‘‘. To try it you’ll need a bucket, some bottled water, lots of salt (we used 700g of the stuff doing this), and a big bag of ice.\n]\nSupercooling involves lowering the temperature of a substance but preventing it taking a solid form. In the case of water you can supercool it way down (to about -45°C if you have the right kit) – just so long as you can stop ice crystals forming. Ice forms around ‘nucleation sites’ – places where ice crystals can get a foothold and start growing. These...[Content truncated]",
