Experimental investigations focused on the impact of brine salinity, cooling temperature, and centrifugation time on recovery ratio and treated water purity. Results showed that lower cooling temperatures and brine salinities increased the recovery ratio, albeit with higher residual salinity in the treated water. The FD system operates at atmospheric pressure, offering efficient heat transfer and overcoming challenges like ice adhesion and refrigerant contamination. Additionally, a theoretical model of the system was validated against experimental data.\nFreezing desalination relies on the ice production process, and commonly encountered types of ice include solid ice and slurry ice. Solid ice manufacturing technology is mature but suffers from low ice production efficiency and transportation challenges. On the other hand, slurry ice has garnered significant attention due to its advantages in transportability. Common methods for producing slurry ice include the scraped-surface method, vacuum method, and supercooled method. In the scraped-surface method, ice is formed on the surface of a cooled drum or cylinder, and then scraped off in thin layers. The method typically involves a refrigerated rotating drum or cylinder. A thin layer of water is sprayed onto the surface of the drum, where it freezes \\. As the drum rotates, a scraper or blade removes the thin layer of ice, continuously exposing freshwater to the cold surface, which then freezes. This process continues, gradually building up a layer of ice on the drum's surface. The scraped-surface method features a simple structure, yet it is prone to equipment wear and requires regular maintenance and replacement of the scraper \\. The vacuum method is another technique used in the production of slurry ice \\. This method involves lowering the pressure above a liquid to decrease its boiling point, which in turn facilitates the freezing of the liquid \\. The vacuum method for producing slurry ice features a simple structure and easy operation, eliminating the need for a large amount of refrigerant. However, it places high demands on equipment airtightness, which has limited its widespread adoption. The supercooled method involves cooling water below its freezing point without it solidifying, creating a supercooled state \\. When disturbed, such as by agitation or the introduction of an ice nucleus, the supercooled water rapidly freezes into ice. The supercooled method for producing slurry ice is characterized by its simple equipment and low energy consumption, but it faces challenges related to the instability of supercooled water and the need for efficient supercooling removal methods \\. Resolving the issues of supercooled water stability and effective supercooling release techniques is crucial for the advancement of the supercooled method in slurry ice production.

While water is possibly the most studied liquid, there remain many areas where its behavior is still mysterious1. A prime example for this is the freezing and the supercooling of water occurring in our daily lives and scientific research2,3. Ice formation and the preceding supercooled state of microdroplets in atmospheric clouds are crucial elements for precipitation and reflection of solar radiation4,5. Furthermore, chilling, freezing, freeze avoidance, and supercooling are important strategies to combat cold environment for ectothermic animals6,7, treat malignant diseases via cryotherapy8, and preserve food and various biological samples, such as cells, tissues, and organs9,10.\nRecent advances have shown that supercooling can be a promising alternative approach for the preservation of cells, tissues, and especially organs11. Nevertheless, an important hurdle for supercooling preservation, as well as other applications of supercooling, is that simultaneous low temperature (<−10 °C), large volume (>1 ml), and long period (>1 week) of supercooling for aqueous solutions cannot be readily achieved12,13,14. High-pressure-based approaches have provided supercooled states of water down to −92 °C briefly1, according to the water phase diagram. They are, however, expensive, might further complicate preservation of biological samples, and their long-term fate is unknown. Few experiments have unstably supercooled large volumes, several hundred milliliters, of water to −12 °C15, albeit also for periods on the order of seconds. Similarly, in Dorsey’s classical work on freezing of supercooled water, he was able to achieve a temperature of −19 °C for a few milliliters of water very briefly during his constant cooling experiments16. A method that overcomes these hurdles and enables long-term supercooling of large aqueous samples at low temperatures could find applications in biopreservation, as well as many other areas which have previously been practically prohibited.\nUnder normal atmospheric conditions, ice melts at 0 °C, the ice-water equilibrium temperature (Te). Nevertheless, the observed freezing temperature (Tf) for pure water could fall below Te since successful ice nucleation at 0 °C can take a long time. Water, in the liquid phase, below the equilibrium temperature is said to be “supercooled” where ΔT = Te − Tf measures the degree of supercooling.

However, current supercooling techniques are not thermodynamically stable; mild agitations can cause rapid and destructive ice formation throughout the system, rendering them unsuitable for transportation and sharply limiting applicability outside the controlled laboratory environment. In this experimental study, we report a simple thermodynamic alteration to standard supercooling protocols, the use of constant-volume (isochoric) conditions, which substantially increases the stability of the system in the face of various macroscopic perturbations, including drop-impact, vibration, ultrasonication, and thermal fluctuation. We identify this effect as driven by a possible combination of thermodynamic and kinetic factors, including reduction of microscopic density fluctuations, elimination of the air–water interface, and significant resistance to cavitation.\nEffective preservation of complex organ and tissue systems is essential to a wide range of medical and research efforts of the 21st century,1 including expanding access to lifesaving organ transplantations, enabling the storage and transportation of engineered tissues for drug-testing, etc. While classical approaches to preservation have often included high doses of cryoprotectant chemicals and ultralow cryogenic temperatures, a new generation of protocols is leveraging thermodynamic supercooling to dramatically enhance the duration and quality of biopreservation while operating in the high-subzero centigrade regime (between −20 °C and −3 °C) and minimizing cryoprotectant concentrations.2–5\nAlthough this approach has produced strong early biological results in the laboratory, the reduction of these protocols to practice in a clinical or industry setting faces a fundamental limitation: thermodynamic stability.6 Supercooling...[Content truncated]",

Supercooling occurs              when a liquid does not freeze although its temperature is below its freezing point.              In general, supercooling is an unstable condition and occurs under special conditions.              The parameters that influence supercooling stability and probability of occurrence              include freezer temperature and water’s initial temperature. In this paper, it is              shown that with a freezer temperature range of −3˚C to −8˚C,              supercooling is most likely to happen and is independent of the water’s initial              temperature. Furthermore, as the freezer temperature decreases, the probability              of nucleation increases, causing instant freezing. Finally, it is concluded that              the Mpemba effect, in which initially hot water freezes faster than initially cold              water, is due to the supercooling instability in initially hot water in which nucleation              agents are more active.\n 1.

Experimental investigations focused on the impact of brine salinity, cooling temperature, and centrifugation time on recovery ratio and treated water purity. Results showed that lower cooling temperatures and brine salinities increased the recovery ratio, albeit with higher residual salinity in the treated water. The FD system operates at atmospheric pressure, offering efficient heat transfer and overcoming challenges like ice adhesion and refrigerant contamination. Additionally, a theoretical model of the system was validated against experimental data.\nFreezing desalination relies on the ice production process, and commonly encountered types of ice include solid ice and slurry ice. Solid ice manufacturing technology is mature but suffers from low ice production efficiency and transportation challenges. On the other hand, slurry ice has garnered significant attention due to its advantages in transportability. Common methods for producing slurry ice include the scraped-surface method, vacuum method, and supercooled method. In the scraped-surface method, ice is formed on the surface of a cooled drum or cylinder, and then scraped off in thin layers. The method typically involves a refrigerated rotating drum or cylinder. A thin layer of water is sprayed onto the surface of the drum, where it freezes \\. As the drum rotates, a scraper or blade removes the thin layer of ice, continuously exposing freshwater to the cold surface, which then freezes. This process continues, gradually building up a layer of ice on the drum's surface. The scraped-surface method features a simple structure, yet it is prone to equipment wear and requires regular maintenance and replacement of the scraper \\. The vacuum method is another technique used in the production of slurry ice \\. This method involves lowering the pressure above a liquid to decrease its boiling point, which in turn facilitates the freezing of the liquid \\. The vacuum method for producing slurry ice features a simple structure and easy operation, eliminating the need for a large amount of refrigerant. However, it places high demands on equipment airtightness, which has limited its widespread adoption. The supercooled method involves cooling water below its freezing point without it solidifying, creating a supercooled state \\. When disturbed, such as by agitation or the introduction of an ice nucleus, the supercooled water rapidly freezes into ice. The supercooled method for producing slurry ice is characterized by its simple equipment and low energy consumption, but it faces challenges related to the instability of supercooled water and the need for efficient supercooling removal methods \\. Resolving the issues of supercooled water stability and effective supercooling release techniques is crucial for the advancement of the supercooled method in slurry ice production.

        "Question": "What experimental conditions are necessary to achieve supercooling in water, as demonstrated in the video?",
        "Answer": "To achieve supercooling in water, as demonstrated in the video, several experimental conditions must be met:\n\n1. **Purity of Water**: The water used must be very pure, as impurities provide nucleation sites that can trigger freezing. The more pure the water, the easier it is to supercool it below its freezing point without solidifying. The video refers to using \"extremely pure\" water, which is critical for achieving the supercooled state. This aligns with the findings that water can remain in a liquid state if it lacks impurities [Query 1_evidence1].\n\n2. **Controlled Temperature**: The water needs to be cooled to a temperature below its conventional freezing point of 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). The evidence suggests that water can be supercooled to about -40 degrees Celsius briefly, but practical limitations mean that it typically remains supercooled around -20 degrees Celsius or less in household conditions. This controlled cooling allows for the water to reach a state where it is still liquid despite being below freezing [Query 2_evidence1].\n\n3. **Careful Handling**: The container holding the water should not be disturbed during the cooling process. Any shaking, dropping, or opening of the bottle introduces disturbances or nucleation sites that can cause the supercooled water to rapidly freeze. In the video, a \"sharp jolt\" to the bottle is used to initiate the freezing process. This disturbance is necessary to trigger the crystallization of ice, demonstrating that the initial supercooled state is sensitive to physical disturbances [Query 1_evidence2].\n\n4. **Lack of Nucleation Sites**: Keeping the bottle sealed and smooth without dust particles or other nucleation sites for as long as possible enhances the likelihood of successfully achieving supercooling. Once a nucleation site is introduced, the transition from supercooled liquid to solid ice can happen almost instantaneously. This underscores the importance of environmental control during the experiment [Query 1_evidence2].\n\nIn summary, achieving supercooling in water requires using very pure water, maintaining a controlled and sufficiently low temperature, avoiding disturbances during cooling, and minimizing nucleation sites.",
