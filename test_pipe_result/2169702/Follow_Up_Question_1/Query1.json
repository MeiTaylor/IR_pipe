You can compare with another bottle which froze hard in your freezer overnight how hard it is to squeeze the bottle and how long it takes to melt. The ice will also take up more room than the water it used to be, and some water may spill out the top.\nThere can also be some small effects of pressure and of dissolved gases on the freezing temperature. Is your water under pressure?\nTom and Mike\n_(published on 10/22/2007)_\nFollow-Up #1: Supercooled water in the freezer\n----------------------------------------------\nQ:\nWater in my mom’s freezer or fridge,doesn’t matter which one, can be in there for days and it won’t freeze solid. In fact it looks perfectly clear until you do one of 3 things. You shake it, you drop it or you open it. It then turns to slush. I want to do a science fair project on this because it’s amazing to me, but I’m not sure what my hypothesize would be. I was thinking that maybe oxygen had to be present to freeze, but you are saying that it all begins just with the change that causes the cystals to grow?  \n\\- Jordan Canevari 11  \nOkeechobee,Florida, usa\nA:\nRight. You’ve actually done the experiment to show that oxygen is not the key. Shaking or dropping the bottle doesn’t add oxygen to it, but does trigger the slush formation.\nMike W.\n_(published on 10/22/2007)_\nFollow-Up #2: supercooled water\n-------------------------------\nQ:\nHow super cooled can water get without freezing? also i would just like to comment that i was searching for this answer because the same thing was happening to me here in iraq.  \n\\- Greg (age 24)  \nNavy, Iraq\nA:\nAccording to Wikipedia water can be supercooled to a little below -40°C, at least briefly. I suspect that in practice it will be hard to go below about -20°C, just because ordinary bottles, bubbles, dust, etc. can nucleate freezing. The number of people who have written about observing this is now pretty large, so it seems easier to get large supercooling than I'd guessed.\nMike W.\n_(published on 07/02/2008)_\nFollow-Up #3: supercooling observed\n-----------------------------------\nQ:\nThanks for...[Content truncated]",

However, freeze desalination is rarely used because of the low rates of desalination and freshwater production along with the relatively high treatment costs. In this study, we evaluated a new freeze desalination method using supercooled water dynamic ice making. The proposed method had a theoretical energy consumption of only 58% of that needed for IPCF. With gravity filtration separation of the produced ice–water mixture for 20 min or centrifugal dehydration for 1 min, a 0.5% salt content standard for freshwater and a 60% freshwater yield were attained. In addition, the method produced ice crystals with minimal impurities, after brine attached to the surface was removed through centrifugal dehydration, a 0.05% salt content standard for  was achieved.\nIntroduction\n------------\nDuring the freezing crystallisation process, water automatically removes impurities to maintain its purity.

Phys. 7 December 2021; 155 (21): 214501. https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0075499\nDownload citation file:\nThe structural changes of water upon deep supercooling were studied through wide-angle x-ray scattering at SwissFEL. The experimental setup had a momentum transfer range of 4.5 Å−1, which covered the principal doublet of the x-ray structure factor of water. The oxygen–oxygen structure factor was obtained for temperatures down to 228.5 ± 0.6 K. Similar to previous studies, the second diffraction peak increased strongly in amplitude as the structural change accelerated toward a local tetrahedral structure upon deep supercooling. We also observed an anomalous trend for the second peak position of the oxygen–oxygen structure factor (q2). We found that q2 exhibits an unprecedented positive partial derivative with respect to temperature for temperatures below 236 K. Based on Fourier inversion of our experimental data combined with reference data, we propose that the anomalous q2 shift originates from that a repeat spacing in the tetrahedral network, associated with all peaks...[Content truncated]",

Experimental investigations focused on the impact of brine salinity, cooling temperature, and centrifugation time on recovery ratio and treated water purity. Results showed that lower cooling temperatures and brine salinities increased the recovery ratio, albeit with higher residual salinity in the treated water. The FD system operates at atmospheric pressure, offering efficient heat transfer and overcoming challenges like ice adhesion and refrigerant contamination. Additionally, a theoretical model of the system was validated against experimental data.\nFreezing desalination relies on the ice production process, and commonly encountered types of ice include solid ice and slurry ice. Solid ice manufacturing technology is mature but suffers from low ice production efficiency and transportation challenges. On the other hand, slurry ice has garnered significant attention due to its advantages in transportability. Common methods for producing slurry ice include the scraped-surface method, vacuum method, and supercooled method. In the scraped-surface method, ice is formed on the surface of a cooled drum or cylinder, and then scraped off in thin layers. The method typically involves a refrigerated rotating drum or cylinder. A thin layer of water is sprayed onto the surface of the drum, where it freezes \\. As the drum rotates, a scraper or blade removes the thin layer of ice, continuously exposing freshwater to the cold surface, which then freezes. This process continues, gradually building up a layer of ice on the drum's surface. The scraped-surface method features a simple structure, yet it is prone to equipment wear and requires regular maintenance and replacement of the scraper \\. The vacuum method is another technique used in the production of slurry ice \\. This method involves lowering the pressure above a liquid to decrease its boiling point, which in turn facilitates the freezing of the liquid \\. The vacuum method for producing slurry ice features a simple structure and easy operation, eliminating the need for a large amount of refrigerant. However, it places high demands on equipment airtightness, which has limited its widespread adoption. The supercooled method involves cooling water below its freezing point without it solidifying, creating a supercooled state \\. When disturbed, such as by agitation or the introduction of an ice nucleus, the supercooled water rapidly freezes into ice. The supercooled method for producing slurry ice is characterized by its simple equipment and low energy consumption, but it faces challenges related to the instability of supercooled water and the need for efficient supercooling removal methods \\. Resolving the issues of supercooled water stability and effective supercooling release techniques is crucial for the advancement of the supercooled method in slurry ice production. The opposed-nozzle impinging jet method is another...[Content truncated]",

Under normal conditions, heterogeneous nucleation mechanisms critically prohibit the simultaneous long-term (&gt; 1 week), large volume (&gt; 1 ml), and low temperatures (&lt; −10 °C) supercooling of aqueous solutions. Here, we report on the use of surface sealing of water by an oil phase to significantly diminish the primary heterogeneous nucleation at the water/air interface. We achieve deep supercooling (down to −20 °C) of large volumes of water (up to 100 ml) for long periods (up to 100 days) simultaneously via this approach. Since oils are mixtures of various hydrocarbons we also report on the use of pure alkanes and primary alcohols of various lengths to achieve the same. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of deep supercooling via preliminary studies on extended (100 days) preservation of human red blood cells. Supercooled w",

While water is possibly the most studied liquid, there remain many areas where its behavior is still mysterious1. A prime example for this is the freezing and the supercooling of water occurring in our daily lives and scientific research2,3. Ice formation and the preceding supercooled state of microdroplets in atmospheric clouds are crucial elements for precipitation and reflection of solar radiation4,5. Furthermore, chilling, freezing, freeze avoidance, and supercooling are important strategies to combat cold environment for ectothermic animals6,7, treat malignant diseases via cryotherapy8, and preserve food and various biological samples, such as cells, tissues, and organs9,10.\nRecent advances have shown that supercooling can be a promising alternative approach for the preservation of cells, tissues, and especially organs11. Nevertheless, an important hurdle for supercooling preservation, as well as other applications of supercooling, is that simultaneous low temperature (<−10 °C), large volume (>1 ml), and long period (>1 week) of supercooling for aqueous solutions cannot be readily achieved12,13,14. High-pressure-based approaches have provided supercooled states of water down to −92 °C briefly1, according to the water phase diagram. They are, however, expensive, might further complicate preservation of biological samples, and their long-term fate is unknown. Few experiments have unstably supercooled large volumes, several hundred milliliters, of water to −12 °C15, albeit also for periods on the order of seconds. Similarly, in Dorsey’s classical work on freezing of supercooled water, he was able to achieve a temperature of −19 °C for a few milliliters of water very briefly during his constant cooling experiments16. A method that overcomes these hurdles and enables long-term supercooling of large aqueous samples at low temperatures could find applications in biopreservation, as well as many other areas which have previously been practically prohibited.\nUnder normal atmospheric conditions, ice melts at 0 °C, the ice-water equilibrium temperature (Te). Nevertheless, the observed freezing temperature (Tf) for pure water could fall below Te since successful ice nucleation at 0 °C can take a long time. Water, in the liquid phase, below the equilibrium temperature is said to be “supercooled” where ΔT = Te − Tf measures the degree of supercooling. Supercooled water is intrinsically metastable and can spontaneously transform to lower-energy-level ice crystals through...[Content truncated]",

These experiments are challenging because the proposed LLPT occurs under extreme metastable conditions where the liquid freezes to a crystal on a very short time scale. Here, we analyze models for the LLPT to show that coexistence of distinct high-density and low-density liquid phases may be observed by subjecting low-density amorphous (LDA) ice to ultrafast heating. We then describe experiments in which we heat LDA ice to near the predicted critical point of the LLPT by an ultrafast infrared laser pulse, following which we measure the structure factor using femtosecond x-ray laser pulses. Consistent with our predictions, we observe a LLPT occurring on a time scale < 100 ns and widely separated from ice formation, which begins at times >1 μs.\n**Subject terms:** Phase transitions and critical phenomena, Phase transitions and critical phenomena, Chemical physics, Chemical physics\nObtaining experimental evidence of a liquid-liquid phase transition in supercooled water is challenging due to the rapid crystallization.

Several thermodynamic (for example, isothermal compressibility, isobaric heat capacity and thermal expansion coefficient) and dynamic (for example, viscosity, diffusivity, structural relaxation) observables of liquid water show an anomalous behaviour3. In the supercooled state, the values of these physical observables clearly diverge, with a singularity temperature Ts estimated at ≃228 K. Despite the wide interest and the numerous research efforts on this subject, the origin of these critical phenomena remained unclear4,5...[Content truncated]",

An experimental analysis of overwintering strategies in small permeable arctic invertebrates\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMartin Holmstrup et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002.\nAbstract\n--------\nSoil invertebrate survival in freezing temperatures has generally been considered in the light of the physiological adaptations seen in surface living insects. These adaptations, notably the ability to supercool, have evolved in concert with surface invertebrates' ability to retain body water in a dry environment. However, most soil invertebrates are orders of magnitude less resistant to desiccation than these truly terrestrial insects, opening the possibility that the mechanisms involved in their cold-hardiness are also of a radically different nature. Permeable soil invertebrates dehydrate when exposed in frozen soil. This dehydration occurs because the water vapor pressure of supercooled water is higher than that of ice at the same temperature. The force of this vapor pressure difference is so large that even a few degrees of supercooling will result in substantial water loss, continuing until the vapor pressure of body fluids equals that of the surrounding ice. At this stage, the risk of tissue ice formation has been eliminated, and subzero survival is ensured. Here we show that these soil invertebrates do not base their winter survival on supercooling, as do many other ectotherms, but instead dehydrate and equilibrate their body-fluid melting point to the ambient temperature. They can achieve this equilibration even at the extreme cooling rates seen in polar soils.\nFigures\n-------\n ] \n**Figure 1**Examples of differences in water potential (WP) between the body fluids of a supercooled animal and the surrounding ice at varying ambient temperature. The more intense supercooling becomes, the larger becomes the WP difference. A negative value of WP difference means that the organism loses water to the surrounding ice. The water potential (ψ) of body fluids at a given temperature has been calculated by using Van't Hoff's...[Content truncated]",

An apparatus tailored to accurate density measurements of supercooled water, i.e. liquid water in a metastable state below the freezing point temperature, was recently developed at the Institute of Thermomechanics of the Czech Academy of Sciences. The apparatus, dual-capillary dilatometer, is described, together with the measurement procedure and the evaluation methodology. The primary result of the dual-capillary method are relative densities with respect to the density at a reference temperature and given pressure. In order to calculate absolute densities, densities at the reference temperature as a function of pressure are needed. For calculation of such pressure dependence of density, so called thermodynamic integration involving literature thermodynamic data and our experimental results is used. The dual-capillary dilatometer was successfully employed in density measurements of ordinary water, heavy water and seawater. The data in the temperature range from 238.15 to 303.15 K at pressures from atmospheric up to 200 MPa are presented and compared with respective IAPWS formulations of thermodynamic properties. The data for ordinary water are also compared with an accurate equation of state for supercooled water of Holten et al. (2014) revealing good mutual agreement. The expanded uncertainty of relative densities acquired by means of the dual-capillary method is estimated to be lower than 50 ppm. \n# 1 Introduction \nRecently, an apparatus for accurate density measurements of supercooled water, i.e. liquid water in a metastable state...[Content truncated]",
