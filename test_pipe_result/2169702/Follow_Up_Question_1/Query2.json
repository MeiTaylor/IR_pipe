You can compare with another bottle which froze hard in your freezer overnight how hard it is to squeeze the bottle and how long it takes to melt. The ice will also take up more room than the water it used to be, and some water may spill out the top.\nThere can also be some small effects of pressure and of dissolved gases on the freezing temperature. Is your water under pressure?\nTom and Mike\n_(published on 10/22/2007)_\nFollow-Up #1: Supercooled water in the freezer\n----------------------------------------------\nQ:\nWater in my mom’s freezer or fridge,doesn’t matter which one, can be in there for days and it won’t freeze solid. In fact it looks perfectly clear until you do one of 3 things. You shake it, you drop it or you open it. It then turns to slush. I want to do a science fair project on this because it’s amazing to me, but I’m not sure what my hypothesize would be. I was thinking that maybe oxygen had to be present to freeze, but you are saying that it all begins just with the change that causes the cystals to grow?  \n\\- Jordan Canevari 11  \nOkeechobee,Florida, usa\nA:\nRight. You’ve actually done the experiment to show that oxygen is not the key. Shaking or dropping the bottle doesn’t add oxygen to it, but does trigger the slush formation.\nMike W.\n_(published on 10/22/2007)_\nFollow-Up #2: supercooled water\n-------------------------------\nQ:\nHow super cooled can water get without freezing? also i would just like to comment that i was searching for this answer because the same thing was happening to me here in iraq.  \n\\- Greg (age 24)  \nNavy, Iraq\nA:\nAccording to Wikipedia water can be supercooled to a little below -40°C, at least briefly. I suspect that in practice it will be hard to go below about -20°C, just because ordinary bottles, bubbles, dust, etc. can nucleate freezing. The number of people who have written about observing this is now pretty large, so it seems easier to get large supercooling than I'd guessed.\nMike W.\n_(published on 07/02/2008)_\nFollow-Up #3: supercooling observed\n-----------------------------------\nQ:\nThanks for...[Content truncated]",

A key role is attributed to the formation of structural aggregates induced by critical phenomena occurring deep in the supercooled region; the nature of the water anomalies and of the hidden critical processes remains elusive. Here we report a time-resolved optical Kerr effect investigation of the vibrational dynamics and relaxation processes in supercooled bulk water. The experiment measures the water intermolecular vibrations and the structural relaxation process in an extended temperature range, and with unprecedented data quality. A mode-coupling analysis of the experimental data enables to characterize the intermolecular vibrational modes and their interplay with the structural relaxation process. The results bring evidence of the coexistence of two local configurations, which are interpreted as high-density and low-density water forms, with an increasing weight of the latter at low temperatures.

A key role is attributed to the formation of structural aggregates induced by critical phenomena occurring deep in the supercooled region; the nature of the water anomalies and of the hidden critical processes remains elusive. Here we report a time-resolved optical Kerr effect investigation of the vibrational dynamics and relaxation processes in supercooled bulk water. The experiment measures the water intermolecular vibrations and the structural relaxation process in an extended temperature range, and with unprecedented data quality. A mode-coupling analysis of the experimental data enables to characterize the intermolecular vibrational modes and their interplay with the structural relaxation process. The results bring evidence of the coexistence of two local configurations, which are interpreted as high-density and low-density water forms, with an increasing weight of the latter at low temperatures.\nYou have full access to this article via your institution.\n\nWater can remain liquid below its melting point and stays in its metastable phase known as supercooled water1,2. Several thermodynamic (for example, isothermal compressibility, isobaric heat capacity and thermal expansion coefficient) and dynamic (for example, viscosity, diffusivity, structural relaxation) observables of liquid water show an anomalous behaviour3. In the supercooled state, the values of these physical observables clearly diverge, with a singularity temperature Ts estimated at ≃228 K. Despite the wide interest and the numerous research efforts on this subject, the origin of these critical phenomena remained unclear4,5...[Content truncated]",

However, current supercooling techniques are not thermodynamically stable; mild agitations can cause rapid and destructive ice formation throughout the system, rendering them unsuitable for transportation and sharply limiting applicability outside the controlled laboratory environment. In this experimental study, we report a simple thermodynamic alteration to standard supercooling protocols, the use of constant-volume (isochoric) conditions, which substantially increases the stability of the system in the face of various macroscopic perturbations, including drop-impact, vibration, ultrasonication, and thermal fluctuation. We identify this effect as driven by a possible combination of thermodynamic and kinetic factors, including reduction of microscopic density fluctuations, elimination of the air–water interface, and significant resistance to cavitation.\nEffective preservation of complex organ and tissue systems is essential to a wide range of medical and research efforts of the 21st century,1 including expanding access to lifesaving organ transplantations, enabling the storage and transportation of engineered tissues for drug-testing, etc. While classical approaches to preservation have often included high doses of cryoprotectant chemicals and ultralow cryogenic temperatures, a new generation of protocols is leveraging thermodynamic supercooling to dramatically enhance the duration and quality of biopreservation while operating in the high-subzero centigrade regime (between −20 °C and −3 °C) and minimizing cryoprotectant concentrations.2–5\nAlthough this approach has produced strong early biological results in the laboratory, the reduction of these protocols to practice in a clinical or industry setting faces a fundamental limitation: thermodynamic stability.6 Supercooling...[Content truncated]",

Supercooling occurs              when a liquid does not freeze although its temperature is below its freezing point.              In general, supercooling is an unstable condition and occurs under special conditions.              The parameters that influence supercooling stability and probability of occurrence              include freezer temperature and water’s initial temperature. In this paper, it is              shown that with a freezer temperature range of −3˚C to −8˚C,              supercooling is most likely to happen and is independent of the water’s initial              temperature. Furthermore, as the freezer temperature decreases, the probability              of nucleation increases, causing instant freezing. Finally, it is concluded that              the Mpemba effect, in which initially hot water freezes faster than initially cold              water, is due to the supercooling instability in initially hot water in which nucleation              agents are more active.\n 1.

The molecules in the crystal have less energy than molecules in liquid water. They move less. So in order to go from liquid water to solid ice, water must lose energy.\nWhen water is cooled to its freezing point, ice crystals begin to form and grow in the water. It is thought that these initial crystals often form around impurities in the water. If you start with a sample of pure water, and cool it slowly, you can produce supercooled liquid water. When ice is added to supercooled water, it acts to catalyze the crystallization of the liquid. The water instantly freezes solid. This is sometimes called \"snap freezing.\"\nIn this project you will use salt and ice to make a \"bath\" that is below the normal freezing point of water. The dissolved salt causes the bath to have a temperature below the normal freezing point of water. This phenomenon is called _freezing point depression_. You can use your salt/ice bath to cool various water samples to investigate which samples can be supercooled, and which samples freeze at the normal freezing point. It's fun to see water suddenly freeze solid. Can you figure out conditions for reliably producing supercooled water?\n### Terms and Concepts\nTo do this project, you should do research that enables you to understand the following terms and concepts:\n*   Change of phase\n*   Freezing\n*   Heat of fusion\n*   Heat of vaporization\n*   Supercooling\n*   Freezing point depression\n### Questions\n*   How does adding salt to ice make it colder?\n### Bibliography\nThis project is based on:\n*   Gregorius, R., Hoff, and V.

A good example of this phenomenon is found everyday in meteorology: clouds in high altitude are an accumulation of supercooled droplets of water below their freezing point. Scientists from the Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives (CEA), the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) and the ESRF have found an experimental explanation of the phenomenon of supercooling. Their research is published this week in Nature.\nSupercooled liquids are trapped in a metastable state even well below their freezing point, which can only be achieved in liquids that do not contain seeds that may trigger crystallization. Clouds at high altitude are a good example for this: they contain tiny droplets of water that, in the absence of seed crystals do not form ice despite the low temperatures. In everyday life, though, there is usually some crystalline impurity in contact with the liquid that will trigger the crystallization process, and therefore the freezing. Controlling solidification behaviour is important for applications ranging from hail prevention up to technological processes such as welding and casting or even the growth of semiconductor nanostructures.\n\nSupercooling was discovered already in 1724 by Fahrenheit, but even today the...[Content truncated]",

However, under the right conditions, pure water can remain a liquid even when cooled to well below its freezing point. When water remains a liquid below its freezing point, it is called **supercooled water**.\nHow do you supercool water, and what causes it to finally freeze solid?

They can be wispy and non-threatening, dark and menacing, towering or diaphanous. We tend to think of them as beyond human reach, as harbingers of forces outside of our control, but as scientists learn more about them, it’s increasingly clear that humanity isn’t merely subjected to whatever weather a cloud portends – we also create and influence it through our everyday actions. And scientists now regularly harness their moisture and pull it to Earth, bringing water to parched communities and landscapes around the world.\nThis rain-inducing technique, called cloud-seeding, has been around for more than 60 years. The process involves “seeding” existing clouds with a harmless substance called silver-iodide to give water droplets a particle to converge around, allowing them to form an ice crystal. Every snowflake you’ve ever seen has initially formed this way – a small speck of dust or pollen floating around the atmosphere collects freezing drops of water, forming the intricate designs that we’re familiar with. The only difference between cloud-seeding and natural precipitation is that instead of dust or pollen, the nucleus of the ice crystal is a tiny particle of silver iodide that scientists released into the cloud. Although not a panacea for drought-stricken regions, cloud-seeding can increase seasonal precipitation by about 10%. In the Reno area alone, winter cloud-seeding efforts are estimated to add enough water to supply about 40,000 households for a year.\n!\n_Microscopic view of snowflakes by Wilson Bentley.
