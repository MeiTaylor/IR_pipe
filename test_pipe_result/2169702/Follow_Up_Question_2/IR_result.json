Cyanobacteria were most likely the first organisms on Earth to release oxygen into the atmosphere, setting in motion the development of higher plant and animal forms. They have the ability to fix nitrogen from the air and contain pigments which allow them to use the sun’s energy for photosynthesis. They also contain compounds capable of absorbing ultraviolet light, which allow them to withstand extreme UV radiation while also being able to tolerate low light conditions. There are species of cyanobacteria adapted to water and land that can withstand extreme temperatures, like those present in pools of water near active volcanoes, or in the Artic.\nThe same properties that allow this ancient organism to exist in extreme environments also make Nostoc difficult to get rid of. To discourage its growth, improve drainage and eliminate phosphorus fertilizers. This terrestrial organism can withstand long dry periods looking like dried, blackened mucus, but it does need periods of standing water or saturated soil to survive. Phosphorus tends to be the most limiting nutrient for this organism’s development, so avoiding excessive phosphorous application and runoff is key.\nHerbicidal soap products that contain potassium salts of fatty acids may be used for temporary management, but the Nostoc will return if cultural conditions are not corrected. Studies conducted by Oregon State University have shown pelargonic acid (Scythe) to be most effective on Nostoc, and it is labelled for treatment of algae, moss and liverworts in container nurseries. It should be noted that application must be made to hydrated Nostoc as application to dried mats will not be effective.

This review will focus on isolated functional fibers (eg, fiber supplements) whose effects on clinical outcomes have been readily assessed in well-controlled clinical studies. This review will also focus on three health benefits (cholesterol lowering, improved glycemic control, and normalizing stool form \\) for which reproducible evidence of clinical efficacy has been published. In the small bowel, clinically meaningful health benefits (eg, cholesterol lowering and improved glycemic control) are highly correlated with the viscosity of soluble fibers: high viscosity fibers (eg, gel-forming fibers such as b-glucan, psyllium, and raw guar gum) exhibit a significant effect on cholesterol lowering and improved glycemic control, whereas nonviscous soluble fibers (eg, inulin, fructooligosaccharides, and wheat dextrin) and insoluble fibers (eg, wheat bran) do not provide these viscosity-dependent health benefits. In the large bowel, there are only two mechanisms that drive a laxative effect: large/coarse insoluble fiber particles (eg, wheat bran) mechanically irritate the gut mucosa stimulating water and mucous secretion, and the high water-holding capacity of gel-forming soluble fiber (eg, psyllium) resists dehydration.

For more than 50 years, potential adverse reactions to additives have been suggested, but to date data are conflicting. The purpose of this article is to provide the clinicians with general information about additives and adverse reactions to them and to suggest a practical approach to children suspected to have reactions to food additives. Methods: We performed an extensive research on all English-language Medline articles, case reports and reviews published online until December 2018. Used search terms were: food additives, food dye, adverse reactions, food allergy, food hypersensitivity, intolerance, drugs, children. Results: There are only few case reports of adverse reactions in childhood with a clear involvement of additives. In this review article we reported the associations between additives and adverse reactions described in literature, in order to inform the pediatrician about the potential clinical manifestations. Conclusions: Prior to suspect an adverse reaction to additives, it is important to rule out other possible causes: the diagnostic process is complicated and rarely conclusive. The gold standard is the double-blind placebo controlled oral challenge after an exclusion diet. (www.actabiomedica.it)\nAdditives are substances used in the food industry for many purposes, such as to preserve food, to improve its taste or appearance. The earliest record of a food additive date from the ancient Egypt, around 1500 BC, when natural extracts were added to candies to make them more appealing (1).\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updates an online list of these food additives that nowadays includes more than 3000 substances (https://www.fda.gov/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/foodadditivesingredients/ucm094211.htm). Prior their use in foods, they must pass a premarket safety evaluation in accordance with a specific food additive regulation from specific government agencies, such as the FDA in the United States or the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in Europe (2).\nA specific group of food additives named “Generally Recognized As Safe” (GRAS) includes about 1000 substances that are considered safe by experts and are exempted from the usual tolerance requirements (3).\nThe widespread use of additives has caused concern among consumers about the possibility of adverse reactions, but few scientific data are available. Recently, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has given rise to doubts regarding the safety of GRAS in children (4).\nThe purpose of this article is to provide the reader with general information about food and drug additives and adverse reactions to these substances and to suggest a practical approach to children suspected to have reactions to additives.\nFood additives are defined according to their specific...[Content truncated]",

The soluble fiber is mainly associated with the pulp or flesh of foods like oranges and potatoes (Lachman et al., 2005). Fructan is a type of inulin that is found in artichokes, bananas, garlic, agave, asparagus, leeks, wheat and onions (Holscher et al., 2014). The soluble fiber attracts water and gets converted into a gel by digestion. These fibers dissolve in water and form a viscous and gelatinous structure in the human digestive system (Wang et al., 2021).\nSoluble fibers can change many metabolic and physiological processes involved in lowering cholesterol levels. These included stomach emptying, carbohydrate and fat digestion and absorption, nutrient intake, postprandial blood response, fermentation in the colon, liver metabolism and fecal excretion (Rideout et al., 2008).\nSoluble dietary...[Content truncated]"

            "content": "Gellan gum is a food additive that was discovered in the 1970s.\nFirst used as a substitute for gelatin and agar agar, it’s currently found in a variety of processed foods, including jams, candy, meats, and fortified plant milks (1).\nYou may wonder whether it offers any benefits or is safe to consume. \nThis article examines gellan gum to determine whether it’s good or bad for you. \nGellan gum is a food additive typically used to bind, stabilize, or texturize processed foods. It’s similar to other gelling agents, including guar gum, carrageenan, agar agar, and xanthan gum. \nIt grows naturally on water lilies but can be artificially produced by fermenting sugar with a specific strain of bacteria (2). \nIt’s a popular replacement for other gelling agents because it’s effective in very small amounts and produces a clear gel that isn’t sensitive to heat (3). \nGellan gum also works as a plant-based alternative to gelatin, which is derived from animal skin, cartilage, or bone.\nGellan gum is an additive used to bind, stabilize, or texturize foods. While naturally occurring, it’s also produced commercially via bacterial fermentation.\nGellan gum has a variety of uses. \nAs a gelling agent, it lends a creamy texture to desserts, gives fillings for baked goods a jelly-like consistency, and reduces the likelihood that certain delicacies — such as creme brûlée or flaming sorbet — will melt when subjected to heat. \nGellan gum is also commonly added to fortified juices and plant milks to help stabilize supplemental nutrients like calcium, keeping them mixed into the beverage rather than pooled at the bottom...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What potential misconceptions might arise from interpreting the gelatinous substance observed in the video?",
        "Answer": "The gelatinous substance observed in the video could lead to several potential misconceptions:\n\n1. **Misinterpretation as a Dangerous Substance**: Viewers might assume that the gelatinous mixture formed from the supercooled water is dangerous or toxic. However, when individuals see a substance resembling gelatin, they may automatically relate it to harmful substances or chemicals. In reality, such substances can often be harmless gelling agents used in many food products, such as gellan gum, which is commonly found in various processed foods and is safe for consumption. \n\n2. **Link to Algae or Molds**: Another misconception could arise from the visual similarity of the gelatinous substance to organic growths such as algae or molds. This misidentification can occur when the gelatinous consistency resembles figures such as Nostoc, which is a type of cyanobacteria that can form gelatin-like substances and appears in moist environments. While Nostoc can have appearances similar to harmless gels, it is often unwelcome in lawns. Such comparisons might lead individuals to incorrectly label the gelatinous substance as harmful or indicative of poor environmental conditions.\n\n3. **Gelling Agent Confusion**: Some may believe that the gelatinous nature of the substance equates to it being an indicator of spoilage or a sign of a chemical reaction gone wrong. Gellan gum, for instance, fits into a category of food additives capable of creating gel-like substances, which are not a sign of spoilage but rather a desirable food texture. People may not realize that the gel-like properties of many substances are cultivated intentionally in food science for various applications, thus potentially leading to unnecessary alarm about the quality of what may simply be supercooled, then crystallized water.\n\nOverall, these misconceptions highlight the importance of clear scientific communication regarding the properties and safety of substances that may appear gelatinous.",
