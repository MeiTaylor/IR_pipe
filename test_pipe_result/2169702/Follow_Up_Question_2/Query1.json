This review will focus on isolated functional fibers (eg, fiber supplements) whose effects on clinical outcomes have been readily assessed in well-controlled clinical studies. This review will also focus on three health benefits (cholesterol lowering, improved glycemic control, and normalizing stool form \\) for which reproducible evidence of clinical efficacy has been published. In the small bowel, clinically meaningful health benefits (eg, cholesterol lowering and improved glycemic control) are highly correlated with the viscosity of soluble fibers: high viscosity fibers (eg, gel-forming fibers such as b-glucan, psyllium, and raw guar gum) exhibit a significant effect on cholesterol lowering and improved glycemic control, whereas nonviscous soluble fibers (eg, inulin, fructooligosaccharides, and wheat dextrin) and insoluble fibers (eg, wheat bran) do not provide these viscosity-dependent health benefits. In the large bowel, there are only two mechanisms that drive a laxative effect: large/coarse insoluble fiber particles (eg, wheat bran) mechanically irritate the gut mucosa stimulating water and mucous secretion, and the high water-holding capacity of gel-forming soluble fiber (eg, psyllium) resists dehydration.

Cyanobacteria were most likely the first organisms on Earth to release oxygen into the atmosphere, setting in motion the development of higher plant and animal forms. They have the ability to fix nitrogen from the air and contain pigments which allow them to use the sun’s energy for photosynthesis. They also contain compounds capable of absorbing ultraviolet light, which allow them to withstand extreme UV radiation while also being able to tolerate low light conditions. There are species of cyanobacteria adapted to water and land that can withstand extreme temperatures, like those present in pools of water near active volcanoes, or in the Artic.\nThe same properties that allow this ancient organism to exist in extreme environments also make Nostoc difficult to get rid of. To discourage its growth, improve drainage and eliminate phosphorus fertilizers. This terrestrial organism can withstand long dry periods looking like dried, blackened mucus, but it does need periods of standing water or saturated soil to survive. Phosphorus tends to be the most limiting nutrient for this organism’s development, so avoiding excessive phosphorous application and runoff is key.\nHerbicidal soap products that contain potassium salts of fatty acids may be used for temporary management, but the Nostoc will return if cultural conditions are not corrected. Studies conducted by Oregon State University have shown pelargonic acid (Scythe) to be most effective on Nostoc, and it is labelled for treatment of algae, moss and liverworts in container nurseries. It should be noted that application must be made to hydrated Nostoc as application to dried mats will not be effective. Pelargonic acid is a broad-spectrum, contact herbicide that will damage all plants, even desirable ones. Any products must be used carefully according to label directions or damage to turfgrasses or other plants may occur.\nCore aerating the lawn to reduce compaction may help, but tilling the soil will merely break it into more pieces and encourage its spread. The presence of Nostoc may indicate a larger issue—poor drainage or compaction. It may be possible to address those concerns by installing drainage tile, using soil contouring, or addressing compaction mechanically through deep chiseling. For paved surfaces and small patches in lawns, shoveling it up and discarding it in a landfill may be the simplest option for control.\nAlthough we may not appreciate it growing in our lawns or on our pavement, Nostoc possesses many redeeming properties. Several Nostoc species have been used as both...[Content truncated]",

Detox products are not available by prescription; they are sold in retail stores, at spas, over the Internet, and by direct mail. Many are advertised as useful for detoxifying specific organs or systems; others are portrayed as \"whole body\" cleansers. Here is a review of some of the most widely promoted procedures and products.\nAlso known as Jala Neti or nasal lavage, this yoga-derived technique involves the use of a small pitcher (neti pot) or syringe to stream a saline solution into first one nostril, then the other. The solution passes through the nasal passage and out the other nostril or the mouth.\nPurpose. Clinicians sometimes recommend nasal irrigation to rid the nose of environmental irritants, alleviate post-nasal drip, and reduce congestion from colds and allergies by flushing mucus, foreign particles, bacteria, and viruses out of the sinuses. Daily nasal irrigation is promoted for preventing sinus infections and headaches.\nEvidence of effectiveness. In a handful of studies, nasal lavage has been shown to lower bacterial concentrations in nasal passages. One small study found that it eased symptoms in sinus sufferers. Some research suggests it can reduce the risk of sinus infections.\nRisks. Fluid buildup in the sinuses.\nCost. Syringes and pitchers range from $4 to $300.\nA seemingly infinite array of products and diets is available for detoxifying the entire body. One of the most popular is the Master Cleanse diet, favored by a number of Hollywood celebrities. Dieters take a quart of warm salt water in the morning; consume a 60-ounce concoction of water, lemon juice, maple syrup, and cayenne pepper throughout the day; and finish with a cup of laxative tea in the evening. Proponents of the Master Cleanse diet recommend adhering to it for at least 10 days.\nPurpose. To restore energy, lose weight, and relieve symptoms of chronic conditions like arthritis and fibromyalgia.\nEvidence of effectiveness. There are no data on this particular diet in the medical literature. But many studies have shown that fasts and extremely low-calorie diets invariably lower the body's basal metabolic rate as it struggles to conserve energy. Once the dieter resumes normal eating, rapid weight gain follows. Much of the weight loss achieved through this diet results from fluid loss related to extremely low carbohydrate intake and frequent bowel movements or diarrhea produced by salt water and laxative tea. When the dieter resumes normal fluid intake...[Content truncated]",

But animals are used for more than meat, and they play a huge role in our everyday lives, even when we have no clue. Animals provide different chemicals, compounds and materials that can be used to make everyday items. For instance, about 99 percent of a cow can be used for meat and more. Now that is ensuring nothing goes to waste!\nWant to up your trivia game, fascinate your kids or impress your friends with fun agriculture facts? Here are seven sometimes surprising ways animals contribute to our lives.\nOne of the most visible uses is in our clothes and shoes. Animals give us leather, wool and other fabrics to wear. They also show up in our upholstery and other home décor.\nAnimals play a big role in many of our daily beauty regimens. Collagen, lanolin, keratin and hyaluronic acid all come from animals. These components can help smooth and strengthen our skin, hair and nails.\nYou’ve probably heard the term “pigskin” for a football. The nickname traces back to the late 1800s, when certain animal parts were used to make balls. However, today footballs are made from rubber or leather, which are also used in other sporting equipment like baseball gloves.\nThese are just a couple of examples of things we eat that use gelatin, which comes from animals. Gelatin is known for its...[Content truncated]",

The investigation of rodents has exhibited that the utilization of inulin‐type strands differentially reduces body weight, convergence of blood glucose and blood cholesterol (Rendón‐Huerta et al., 2012).\nAccording to several studies, higher consumption of dietary fiber is beneficial for a variety of health outcomes, while many results showed that there has been no attempt to systematically capture the breadth of outcomes associated with intake of dietary fiber or assess the quality and strength of evidence on the association of dietary fiber intake, different medical conditions and health outcomes (Veronese et al., 2018). Generally, the fiber in food (fermented fiber) is the basis of a healthy diet. While prebiotics are specialized food ingredients that affect the final fermentation of products. It is beneficial for the host's health and specific bacteria (Platta, 2020). The study of rodents has demonstrated that the consumption of inulin‐type fibers differentially reduces body weight and the concentration of blood glucose and blood cholesterol (Rendón‐Huerta et al., 2012).\nHolscher (2017) demonstrated the effect of prebiotics and fiber utilization on the metabolic capacity and composition of human gastrointestinal microbiota. The impacts of physiochemical properties of complex sugar can improved the health of human microbiota.\n\nSoluble fiber is present in barley, nuts, beans, seeds, peas, lentils, fruits, vegetables and oat bran. This is also present in psyllium, which is a fiber supplement. This fiber is generally derived from the inner flesh of foods that are plant‐based (Mudgil, 2017). The soluble fiber is mainly associated with the pulp or flesh of foods like oranges and potatoes (Lachman et al., 2005). Fructan is a type of inulin that is found in artichokes, bananas, garlic, agave, asparagus, leeks, wheat and onions (Holscher et al., 2014). The soluble fiber attracts water and gets converted into a gel by digestion. These fibers dissolve in water and form a viscous and gelatinous structure in the human digestive system (Wang et al., 2021).\nSoluble fibers can change many metabolic and physiological processes involved in lowering cholesterol levels. These included stomach emptying, carbohydrate and fat digestion and absorption, nutrient intake, postprandial blood response, fermentation in the colon, liver metabolism and fecal excretion (Rideout et al., 2008).\nSoluble dietary...[Content truncated]",
