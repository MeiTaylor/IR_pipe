It\u2019s similar to other gelling agents, including guar gum, carrageenan, agar agar, and xanthan gum. \nIt grows naturally on water lilies but can be artificially produced by fermenting sugar with a specific strain of bacteria (2). \nIt\u2019s a popular replacement for other gelling agents because it\u2019s effective in very small amounts and produces a clear gel that isn\u2019t sensitive to heat (3). \nGellan gum also works as a plant-based alternative to gelatin, which is derived from animal skin, cartilage, or bone.\nGellan gum is an additive used to bind, stabilize, or texturize foods. While naturally occurring, it\u2019s also produced commercially via bacterial fermentation.\nGellan gum has a variety of uses. \nAs a gelling agent, it lends a creamy texture to desserts, gives fillings for baked goods a jelly-like consistency, and reduces the likelihood that certain delicacies \u2014 such as creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e or flaming sorbet \u2014 will melt when subjected to heat. \nGellan gum is also commonly added to fortified juices and plant milks to help stabilize supplemental nutrients like calcium, keeping them mixed into the beverage rather than pooled at the bottom...[Content truncated]",

Every year, 1 in 6 people die from cancer. Science is continuously expanding to assess the possible initiating or facilitating factors of cancer, in the hope of reducing these numbers and the human toll,\u201d said Dr Francesco Branca, Director of the Department of Nutrition and Food Safety, WHO. \u201cThe assessments of aspartame have indicated that, while safety is not a major concern at the doses which are commonly used, potential effects have been described that need to be investigated by more and better studies.\u201d\nThe two bodies conducted independent but complementary reviews to assess the potential carcinogenic hazard and other health risks associated with aspartame consumption. This was the first time that IARC has evaluated aspartame and the third time for JECFA.\nAfter reviewing the available scientific literature, both evaluations noted limitations in the available evidence for cancer (and other health effects). \nIARC classified aspartame as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) on the basis of limited evidence for cancer in humans (specifically, for hepat...[Content truncated]",

For more than 50 years, potential adverse reactions to additives have been suggested, but to date data are conflicting. The purpose of this article is to provide the clinicians with general information about additives and adverse reactions to them and to suggest a practical approach to children suspected to have reactions to food additives. Methods: We performed an extensive research on all English-language Medline articles, case reports and reviews published online until December 2018. Used search terms were: food additives, food dye, adverse reactions, food allergy, food hypersensitivity, intolerance, drugs, children. Results: There are only few case reports of adverse reactions in childhood with a clear involvement of additives. In this review article we reported the associations between additives and adverse reactions described in literature, in order to inform the pediatrician about the potential clinical manifestations. Conclusions: Prior to suspect an adverse reaction to additives, it is important to rule out other possible causes: the diagnostic process is complicated and rarely conclusive. The gold standard is the double-blind placebo controlled oral challenge after an exclusion diet. (www.actabiomedica.it)\nAdditives are substances used in the food industry for many purposes, such as to preserve food, to improve its taste or appearance. The earliest record of a food additive date from the ancient Egypt, around 1500 BC, when natural extracts were added to candies to make them more appealing (1).\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updates an online list of these food additives that nowadays includes more than 3000 substances (https://www.fda.gov/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/foodadditivesingredients/ucm094211.htm). Prior their use in foods, they must pass a premarket safety evaluation in accordance with a specific food additive regulation from specific government agencies, such as the FDA in the United States or the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in Europe (2).\nA specific group of food additives named \u201cGenerally Recognized As Safe\u201d (GRAS) includes about 1000 substances that are considered safe by experts and are exempted from the usual tolerance requirements (3).\nThe widespread use of additives has caused concern among consumers about the possibility of adverse reactions, but few scientific data are available. Recently, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has given rise to doubts regarding the safety of GRAS in children (4).\nThe purpose of this article is to provide the reader with general information about food and drug additives and adverse reactions to these substances and to suggest a practical approach to children suspected to have reactions to additives.\nFood additives are defined according to their specific...[Content truncated]",
