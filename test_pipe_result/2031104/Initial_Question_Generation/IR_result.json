        "Question": "Did Bill Clinton enter polling places on Super Tuesday, and what evidence supports this?",
        "Answer": "Yes, Bill Clinton did enter polling places on Super Tuesday. Evidence supporting this claim includes reports indicating that he visited several polling locations in Massachusetts while campaigning for his wife, Hillary Clinton.\n\n1. According to a Boston Globe article, during Super Tuesday, Bill Clinton entered polling stations in Newton, Massachusetts, while campaigning, which led to some concern about the respect of election laws. The article states that while he could greet election workers, he wasn't allowed to solicit votes within the polling locations. This implies that he did enter these polling places during his visit [Query 1_evidence_1].\n\n2. Similarly, a report from MassLive confirms that Bill Clinton spent time at multiple polling places on Super Tuesday, including Holy Name Church gymnasium in West Roxbury. The article describes him greeting voters, shaking hands, and taking pictures as he made his rounds, which further supports the claim that he entered polling areas [Query 2_evidence_1].\n\nTaken together, the evidence strongly suggests that Bill Clinton did enter polling places on Super Tuesday while engaging with voters.",
