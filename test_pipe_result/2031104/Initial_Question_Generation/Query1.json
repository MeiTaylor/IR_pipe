Only if he was actively campaigning when he went inside the polling stations, which doesn't seem to be the case.\"\nFinally, on March 2, CNN spoke to McNiff, who said that Galvin's office was not aware of any legally prohibited activity at any of the four polling places involved:\nMcNiff said that shaking hands alone isn't prohibited. Explicit campaigning is what's banned within 150 feet of a polling places.\n\"Just meeting people doesn't constitute campaigning,\" McNiff told CNN. \"We received no information that anything like that happened.\"\nSo, it's true that Bill Clinton's Super Tuesday activities in Massachusetts caught the attention of state officials, but there was no proof of any specific violations, and no indication that any laws had been broken.\nCarole Fader:  (904) 359-4635",

The issue is, you can’t go inside and say, ‘Vote for my wife,’ or ‘Vote for Hillary,’” Galvin said in a telephone interview Wednesday.\nGalvin said that in New Bedford, the former president did speak in front of the polling location, but Galvin didn’t know how close he was.\nGalvin said that his office was “annoyed” that Clinton addressed hundreds of people during an “ad hoc” rally near a polling place, after his wife’s campaign had already been contacted several times. But allegations that Clinton kept people from actually voting in the election, Galvin said, are erroneous.\n“It’s unusual to have someone outside having a rally, that’s for sure,” Galvin said. “But voting was never interrupted, and voters could always get access to the polls”\nGalvin said his office is not “investigating” Clinton’s conduct, but rather, his office wants to look at ways to make sure that, in the future, candidates' supporters don’t cause traffic jams or hinder access to voting locations.\nAdvertisement\n* * *\n* * *\n“There was a traffic issue, there is no disputing that — it should have been organized away from the polls,” Galvin said. “It definitely made it more difficult for voters to park — that I don’t dispute — but the voting was never disrupted.”\nPeter Ubertaccio, a political science professor at Stonehill College, said that Clinton’s staff should have taken “much better care to ensure he didn’t do anything that was viewed as disruptive.” But at this point, he said, it’s not likely that much can be done.\n“Not every violation needs to result in some sort of...[Content truncated]",

The specific states that participate in Super Tuesday have varied, because every U.S. state independently determines how and when it will hold primary elections.\nBecause of the large number of presidential-convention delegates that could be won by a single Democratic or Republican presidential candidate on Super Tuesday, the results of Super Tuesday elections often solidify the frontrunner for each party’s presidential nomination. Election and polling experts generally view the electoral results of Super Tuesday as strong indicators of the likely U.S. presidential nominees, owing to the usual participation of large and fairly diverse voting populations. Depending on how many and which states conduct presidential primary elections on Super Tuesday, one-third or more of all delegates to either or both the Democratic National Convention and the Republican National Convention can be won through votes cast on Super Tuesday.\nPresidential elections in the United States have been held on Tuesdays—specifically, the Tuesday following the first Monday of November in a presidential election year—since the mid-19th century, when the U.S. Congress passed a law designed to make voting in presidential elections as convenient as possible for religiously observant citizens and farmers. Among the first primary election days to be designated a “super Tuesday” in certain national publications (including The New York Times) was May 25, 1976, when presidential primaries were held in six states. The terms “super-Tuesday” and “Super Tuesday” subsequently became increasingly common among journalists and political commentators.\nIn 1980 the phrase “Super Tuesday” was widely used to refer to primaries held in three states—Alabama, Florida, and Georgia—on March 11. Campaign strategists for Democratic Pres. Jimmy Carter reportedly arranged the movement of the three Southern state primaries, which Carter was expected to win, to the Tuesday after the New Hampshire Democratic primary, which strategists feared Carter might lose, thus effectively guaranteeing a rebound effect for Carter’s campaign. (In fact, Carter won the New Hampshire primary and swept the ensuing Southern primaries but lost the general presidential election to Republican...[Content truncated]",

Galvin also is listed as a defendant.\nThe lawsuit does not specifically refer to Bill Clinton’s visit to New Bedford the same day, citing only Boston and Newton, but says the former president “also made campaign stops in other cities and towns.”\nBill Clinton talked to a crowd of more than 1,200 people for about four minutes just outside the Buttonwood Warming House polling location, during his brief stop in New Bedford.\nThe civil suit was filed by Boston resident Kathleen Cody, who is listed as a member of a group called MA Sanders Voters and Volunteers Disenfranchised by Bill Clinton. Cody is listed as a “pro se” plaintiff, though, meaning she’s filing the suit only on her own behalf.\nThe lawsuit’s Exhibit D further clarifies that distinction, saying MA Sanders Voters and Volunteers Disenfranchised by Bill Clinton, “is not and cannot be represented by pro se plaintiff,” but supports the “voter disenfranchisement complaint.”\nCody initially said Friday that she had heard of the group only \"vaguely\" and was not fully aware of her lead role in the lawsuit, saying: “I did sign it, but it was just supporting the thing, as I understood it.”\nShe recanted later Friday, though, saying: “I was listed simply because I was handier, I guess. …It’s not like I’m really doing it on my own.
