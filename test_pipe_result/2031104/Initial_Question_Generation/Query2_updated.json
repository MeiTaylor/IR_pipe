Her victory there was due to overwhelming support from black voters, putting her in position for a strong showing in several Southern states with large African-American electorates that vote Tuesday.\nClinton has increasingly turned her attention to Trump in recent days, casting herself as a civil alternative to the insults and bullying that have consumed the Republican race.\n\u201cWhat we can\u2019t let happen is the scapegoating, the flaming, the finger pointing that is going on the Republican side...[Content truncated]",

It was awesome!\"\nClinton, the former president and the husband of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, is spending Tuesday morning in Massachusetts, visiting four polling places in the eastern part of the state. He also held a late-night rally in Worcester on Monday.\nMassachusetts is one of more than a dozen\u00a0states holding\u00a0a presidential primary or caucus on Super Tuesday, and it is home to one of the tightest contests on the Democratic side, where Hillary Clinton is running against Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\"It's great to see the attention here in Boston and Massachusetts,\" said Boston Mayor Marty Walsh. \"I think that people aren't taking it for granted. Certainly, President Clinton being here today says a lot on Election Day. He could be in any state in the country, and he's here in Massachusetts.\"\nClinton spent 45 minutes at the polling place in West Roxbury, his first stop of the day.
