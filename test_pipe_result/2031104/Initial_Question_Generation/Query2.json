Her victory there was due to overwhelming support from black voters, putting her in position for a strong showing in several Southern states with large African-American electorates that vote Tuesday.\nClinton has increasingly turned her attention to Trump in recent days, casting herself as a civil alternative to the insults and bullying that have consumed the Republican race.\nâWhat we canât let happen is the scapegoating, the flaming, the finger pointing that is going on the Republican side...[Content truncated]",
