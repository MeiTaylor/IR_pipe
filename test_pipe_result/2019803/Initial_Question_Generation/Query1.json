Senator and Mrs. Byrd, Senator Rockefeller, Congressmen Mollohan, Rahall, and Wise, and Governor Caperton, and friends, I am glad to be here with all you folks from West Virginia, a small State with a lot of mountains. I identify with it.\nI'm mostly glad to be here to speak for Senator Byrd tonight. You know, one of the first things I did on coming to Washington as President was to go by Senator Byrd's office and pay a visit. And on that visit, he gave me a copy of his \"History of the Senate,\" which I actually proceeded to read, fearing he would one day give me an examination on it. [Laughter] Now, in this book, among other things, he has a very moving autobiography in which he expresses his respect for Senator Richard Russell and for Senator John Stennis because of the advice and kindness that they gave to him. I feel the same way; I've learned a lot from Senator Byrd. He's always been unfailingly kind, and he's given me a lot of information I've needed and a lot of wise counsel.\nSenator Byrd also expresses in this book his friendship for the late President Johnson, and he describes his relationship with President Johnson. And I can identify with that, too. There's a particularly moving part of this autobiography where he describes how he talked L.B.J. into appointing a Federal judge he didn't really want...[Content truncated]",

I’m a changed man from what I was and I think Ted is too.\nYoung\nThat was going to be my next question, is he too?\nByrd\nYes.\nYoung\nHow has he changed? You know, you said he had a lot of tragedy. He had some misfortunes too and his private life was not—\nByrd\nYes, yes. I never thought about that. I never spent my time thinking about such. I had my own private fight that wasn’t so good. I joined the Ku Klux Klan when I was young and didn’t have the right attitude. I came from a background that was part of that, so that is that and I regret it. So I have something in my background that I’ve talked a lot about. I don’t hide from it, but I don’t think about the backgrounds. We came from opposite poles but we’re together.\nYoung\nLet me ask you a question about him. Some people have said about Kennedy that he didn’t really decide to become a Senator, as you put it, in the best sense of the term, until his Presidential ambitions crashed. Some people say that that’s when he became a real Senator and I’ve wondered myself whether that’s true or not. Or was the Senate becoming his life, his place in the world of public service, before that? My question is did this happen after his Presidential ambitions were gone, or did you see it happening after that handshake? \nByrd\nI don’t see it through a glass darkly. I saw it up front. He was a Senator before that time. He worked in his committee, and just as I told Mrs. [Hilary Rodham] Clinton once before she became Senator, work your committee. Get to know the jurisdictions, get to know the work. Get to know what’s in that committee, what’s in the work. He did do just that. He has been a study of mine for a long time. I’m looking from the outside and I’m looking from the inside, and I’ve known him as no other person has known him in a way, and my admiration for his work in committee happened earlier than that. He has mastered the work of his committees and he has mastered the work as a Senator. \nI don’t have to be here today to earn a living. I’ve paid into this retirement system longer than any other person on earth; 48 years I’ve paid into it, and before then when I was in the House. So I don’t have to work here to earn a living...[Content truncated]",

On TV bashing Trump. @CNN, she forgot how she said a KKK member was her mentor.\nThe tweet came from Diamond and Silk—sisters Lynette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, who are black—who vocally support Trump and speak frequently at his rallies.\nIt references remarks Clinton made about former West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd, after his death in 2010, Clinton called Byrd “a true American original, my friend and mentor.”\nByrd, the longest-serving U.S. senator in history, served as a grand dragon in the Klan in his youth, which he described as “an extraordinarily foolish mistake” in a 2005 memoir. When he died, the NAACP issued a statement saying his career “reflects the transformative power of this nation” as he “went from being an active member of the KKK to a being a stalwart supporter of the Civil Rights Act.”\nIn an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union, Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, said that the campaign does not welcome the support of former Klan wizard David Duke.\n“It does really bother me,” he said. “And Donald Trump made it clear repeatedly in this week that not only does he denounce David Duke, but we don’t want the support of people who think like David Duke.”\nWrite to Mahita Gajanan at mahita.gajanan@time.com",

I witnessed her rise to leadership. \nShe said in her speech today that she went from \"homemaker to House Speaker.\" This is true but it does not tell the full story of her long involvement in American politics, which was a family calling with her father serving in numerous political offices including Congress and later as Mayor of Baltimore.  She was no ordinary freshman member in 1987. She hit the ground running. Nobody worked harder in the House than did Nancy Pelosi.\nI have studied the speakership and leadership in the House and I had the honor of working for three Speakers: Thomas P. \"Tip\" O' Neill, Jr. of Massachusetts, Jim Wright of Texas, and Tom Foley of Washington State. Nancy Pelosi is the first woman to hold this job and she clearly ranks as one of the best and most effective speakers in American history.\nPast speakers from both parties have sought to represent their party and also the nation.  Some have been negative forces holding back the future and clinging to the past. This negative role was sometimes what the country seemed to want, as was the case at the turn of the 20th Century, when powerful speaker Joe Cannon of Illinois held up progressive legislation for years saying the country was doing fine and didn't need any new legislation.\n​\nWielding power alone does not make a leader great. Power does mark and shape the institution and national affairs.  Greatness in a speaker, I suggest, comes from a positive role, not a negative one. Greatness stems from a vision of a better future and the effort to improve the lives of the people.  In this context Nancy Pelosi qualifies easily as a great speaker.\n​\nToday she cited the Preamble to the Constitution, still the best single definition of what government is for and should do.  Government should establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity. ...[Content truncated]",
