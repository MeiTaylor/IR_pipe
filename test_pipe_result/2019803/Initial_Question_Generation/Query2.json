On TV bashing Trump. @CNN, she forgot how she said a KKK member was her mentor.\nThe tweet came from Diamond and Silk—sisters Lynette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, who are black—who vocally support Trump and speak frequently at his rallies.\nIt references remarks Clinton made about former West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd, after his death in 2010, Clinton called Byrd “a true American original, my friend and mentor.”\nByrd, the longest-serving U.S. senator in history, served as a grand dragon in the Klan in his youth, which he described as “an extraordinarily foolish mistake” in a 2005 memoir. When he died, the NAACP issued a statement saying his career “reflects the transformative power of this nation” as he “went from being an active member of the KKK to a being a stalwart supporter of the Civil Rights Act.”\nIn an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union, Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, said that the campaign does not welcome the support of former Klan wizard David Duke.\n“It does really bother me,” he said. “And Donald Trump made it clear repeatedly in this week that not only does he denounce David Duke, but we don’t want the support of people who think like David Duke.”\nWrite to Mahita Gajanan at mahita.gajanan@time.com",

He later admitted that the filibuster of the Act was his “biggest regret.” He saw the error of his ways.\nSen. Robert Byrd was publicly embarrassed about his membership in the Klan. It was something he apologized for over and over, time and time again, calling his involvement with the organization “a sad mistake” and stating that “intolerance had no place in America.” It became most evident that he had dramatically changed his views after the loss of his grandson in an auto accident. He then realized that black people loved their children just as much as he loved his own. Senator Byrd sought change and with that change he became one of the staunchest supporters of civil rights I had ever seen.\nSenator Byrd appropriated money for memorials to civil rights’ icons. And when President George W. Bush signed the extension of the Voting Rights Act in 2006, Senator Byrd stood alongside me and Senator Ted Kennedy, signing the register, a proud supporter of the legislation’s renewal. How ironic it is that a former Klansman from a coal mining town in West Virginia would stand side by side and shoulder to shoulder with an African-American and former chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) from the Deep South as colleagues in these great halls.\nSenator Byrd’s most undeniable demonstration of change was in the year 2008 when the Democratic Party had the task of selecting its candidate for president. The field had been narrowed to two people, two U.S. senators. They were Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Though Mrs. Clinton won the state of West Virginia in the primary, Senator Byrd backed the first black presidential candidate with a legitimate chance at victory throwing his support behind Barack Obama.\nSenator Byrd and I stood together on many issues but the most prominent issue was our opposition of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He too was a fierce critic of the 2002 congressional resolution that allowed President George. W. Bush to declare war on Iraq.\nThe citizens of West Virginia have lost a great leader, who so many times ensured that they were well represented in the senate sending appropriated funds back to his home state to build highways, bridges, and buildings. He was a champion in the Senate who strutted around its halls with a copy of the U.S. Constitution in his breast pocket often referring to the document when he felt it was necessary. One of my deepest regrets is that Senator Byrd had invited me to his office on several occasions. However, due to the commanding schedules of both the House and Senate, I never made it over there...[Content truncated]",

The NAACP gave him a 100% rating for the 2003–2004 session of Congress on bills before the Senate they were focused on. When he died, the NAACP issued a statement saying he “became a champion for civil rights and liberties”.\nIt’s not easy to make that kind of change in life. But it’s possible. And you can’t just talk the talk, you have to walk the walk. As Byrd did. The Byrd that the Clintons and Obama supported was not the 1941 Byrd, or even the 1964 Byrd. It was the Byrd of the 1990s and 2000s, who was very much a different person.\nAnother interesting story with some parallels is the story of George Wallace, who was endorsed by the NAACP in his first run for governor of Alabama and after losing the Democratic primary to an opponent who was endorsed by the KKK and ran an openly racist campaign famously said “I’ll never be out-niggered again”. His openly racist campaigns through the 1960s and into the 70s are legendary, and while his runs were always as a Democrat or as a third party candidate, both Nixon and Reagan adopted toned-down versions of a number of his strategies and positions to appeal to white voters in the south.\nWallace also had a change of heart later in life, however, and in both word and deed convinced enough Alabamans of that that in his last run for governor in 1982 he won with over 90% of the black vote. He appointed a record number of black Alabamans to positions in state offices, including two in the cabinet for the first time ever.\nBut note how these people publicly admitted that their previous positions were wrong, publicly asked for forgiveness from the people they’d wronged, and acted to atone for their previous behavior. What they didn’t do was try to excuse it, to make up stories about how it wasn’t what it obviously was, or use the “everybody did it in those days” excuse.\nWhat was Hillary Clinton's relationship to Ku Klux Klan member Robert C. Byrd?\nHillary Clinton (who was a member of Congress) came to know Robert Byrd. This was long AFTER Robert Byrd had publicly acknowledged his former racism, and admitted that he had once made the mistake of joining the KKK way back in the 1940s, and after Robert Byrd had publicly apologized to the nation, and admitted that he had learned from his errors, and that he knew how absolutely wrong he had been. After his sincerity was clear by his own actions, and his own behavior, the NAACP had even publicly accepted his apology, and awarded him for his...[Content truncated]",
