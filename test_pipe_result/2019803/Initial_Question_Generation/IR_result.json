I identify with it.\nI'm mostly glad to be here to speak for Senator Byrd tonight. You know, one of the first things I did on coming to Washington as President was to go by Senator Byrd's office and pay a visit. And on that visit, he gave me a copy of his \"History of the Senate,\" which I actually proceeded to read, fearing he would one day give me an examination on it. [Laughter] Now, in this book, among other things, he has a very moving autobiography in which he expresses his respect for Senator Richard Russell and for Senator John Stennis because of the advice and kindness that they gave to him. I feel the same way; I've learned a lot from Senator Byrd. He's always been unfailingly kind, and he's given me a lot of information I've needed and a lot of wise counsel.\nSenator Byrd also expresses in this book his friendship for the late President Johnson, and he describes his relationship with President Johnson. And I can identify with that, too. There's a particularly moving part of this autobiography where he describes how he talked L.B.J. into appointing a Federal judge he didn't really want...[Content truncated]",

I’m a changed man from what I was and I think Ted is too.\nYoung\nThat was going to be my next question, is he too?\nByrd\nYes.\nYoung\nHow has he changed? You know, you said he had a lot of tragedy. He had some misfortunes too and his private life was not—\nByrd\nYes, yes. I never thought about that. I never spent my time thinking about such. I had my own private fight that wasn’t so good. I joined the Ku Klux Klan when I was young and didn’t have the right attitude. I came from a background that was part of that, so that is that and I regret it. So I have something in my background that I’ve talked a lot about. I don’t hide from it, but I don’t think about the backgrounds. We came from opposite poles but we’re together.\nYoung\nLet me ask you a question about him. Some people have said about Kennedy that he didn’t really decide to become a Senator, as you put it, in the best sense of the term, until his Presidential ambitions crashed. Some people say that that’s when he became a real Senator and I’ve wondered myself whether that’s true or not. Or was the Senate becoming his life, his place in the world of public service, before that? My question is did this happen after his Presidential ambitions were gone, or did you see it happening after that handshake? \nByrd\nI don’t see it through a glass darkly. I saw it up front. He was a Senator before that time. He worked in his committee, and just as I told Mrs. [Hilary Rodham] Clinton once before she became Senator, work your committee. Get to know the jurisdictions, get to know the work. Get to know what’s in that committee, what’s in the work. He did do just that. He has been a study of mine for a long time. I’m looking from the outside and I’m looking from the inside, and I’ve known him as no other person has known him in a way, and my admiration for his work in committee happened earlier than that. He has mastered the work of his committees and he has mastered the work as a Senator. \nI don’t have to be here today to earn a living. I’ve paid into this retirement system longer than any other person on earth; 48 years I’ve paid into it, and before then when I was in the House. So I don’t have to work here to earn a living...[Content truncated]",

I identify with it.\nI'm mostly glad to be here to speak for Senator Byrd tonight. You know, one of the first things I did on coming to Washington as President was to go by Senator Byrd's office and pay a visit. And on that visit, he gave me a copy of his \"History of the Senate,\" which I actually proceeded to read, fearing he would one day give me an examination on it. [Laughter] Now, in this book, among other things, he has a very moving autobiography in which he expresses his respect for Senator Richard Russell and for Senator John Stennis because of the advice and kindness that they gave to him. I feel the same way; I've learned a lot from Senator Byrd. He's always been unfailingly kind, and he's given me a lot of information I've needed and a lot of wise counsel.\nSenator Byrd also expresses in this book his friendship for the late President Johnson, and he describes his relationship with President Johnson. And I can identify with that, too. There's a particularly moving part of this autobiography where he describes how he talked L.B.J. into appointing a Federal judge he didn't really want...[Content truncated]"

I’m a changed man from what I was and I think Ted is too.\nYoung\nThat was going to be my next question, is he too?\nByrd\nYes.\nYoung\nHow has he changed? You know, you said he had a lot of tragedy. He had some misfortunes too and his private life was not—\nByrd\nYes, yes. I never thought about that. I never spent my time thinking about such. I had my own private fight that wasn’t so good. I joined the Ku Klux Klan when I was young and didn’t have the right attitude. I came from a background that was part of that, so that is that and I regret it. So I have something in my background that I’ve talked a lot about. I don’t hide from it, but I don’t think about the backgrounds. We came from opposite poles but we’re together.\nYoung\nLet me ask you a question about him. Some people have said about Kennedy that he didn’t really decide to become a Senator, as you put it, in the best sense of the term, until his Presidential ambitions crashed. Some people say that that’s when he became a real Senator and I’ve wondered myself whether that’s true or not. Or was the Senate becoming his life, his place in the world of public service, before that? My question is did this happen after his Presidential ambitions were gone, or did you see it happening after that handshake? \nByrd\nI don’t see it through a glass darkly. I saw it up front. He was a Senator before that time. He worked in his committee, and just as I told Mrs. [Hilary Rodham] Clinton once before she became Senator, work your committee. Get to know the jurisdictions, get to know the work. Get to know what’s in that committee, what’s in the work. He did do just that. He has been a study of mine for a long time. I’m looking from the outside and I’m looking from the inside, and I’ve known him as no other person has known him in a way, and my admiration for his work in committee happened earlier than that. He has mastered the work of his committees and he has mastered the work as a Senator. \nI don’t have to be here today to earn a living. I’ve paid into this retirement system longer than any other person on earth; 48 years I’ve paid into it, and before then when I was in the House. So I don’t have to work here to earn a living...[Content truncated]"

    "QA": {
        "Question": "Does the video evidence support the claim of a personal relationship between Hillary Clinton and Robert Byrd?",
        "Answer": "The video evidence supports the claim of a personal relationship between Hillary Clinton and Robert Byrd. In her remarks, Clinton refers to Byrd as her \"friend\" and \"mentor,\" indicating a deep personal connection. She recalls the heartfelt support he provided during the trying times after the 9/11 attacks, stating that he offered to \"think of me as the third senator from New York,\" which further emphasizes the bond they shared while serving in the Senate together. Moreover, Clinton's acknowledgment of Byrd's impact on her work and his continued support even after she left the Senate underscores their relationship beyond just colleagues. She mentions her reliance on his advice and counsel throughout her career, which signifies a mentor-mentee dynamic as well as a personal friendship. Collectively, this evidence suggests that the nature of their relationship was both professional and personal, marked by mutual respect and support. Therefore, we can confidently conclude that the video evidence does support the claim of a personal relationship between Hillary Clinton and Robert Byrd.",
