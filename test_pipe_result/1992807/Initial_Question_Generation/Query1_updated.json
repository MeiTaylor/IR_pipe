L\u2019Oreal, Estee Lauder, or Procter & Gamble, many of which conduct animal testing to some extent.\nWhile most parent companies are not cruelty-free, some of the brands they own adhere to strict policies against animal testing. This means that brands under these parent companies are still cruelty-free.\nHowever, this gives you as a consumer two choices: You can choose not to support these brands because they\u2019re part of a bigger, animal-testing parent company, or you can choose to support them because they are 100% cruelty-free even though their parent company is not.\nWe personally believe that since these brands operate independently from the parent company, you can support them as they\u2019re cruelty-free. However, a small group of shoppers choose to boycott brands owned by a parent company that tests on animals.\nWe don\u2019t mind which option you choose; we want to make it easy for all our readers. That\u2019s why we decided to mention whether or not a parent company is involved.\n### Is MAC Cruelty-Free Certified?\n**No, MAC is not certified by any organization.**\nCompanies can be fully cruelty-free without being certified, but certifications are a good indicator of their ethical practices. The most trusted organizations that give out certifications are  and .\n### Is MAC Sold Where Animal Testing Is Required By Law?\n**Yes, MAC is available for sale in countries with mandatory animal testing.** This means that their products were likely tested on animals.\nIn countries like China, certain cosmetic products may be subject to mandatory animal testing regulations. If a brand wants to sell its products in physical stores in China, it has to comply with these regulations, where animal testing may occur.\nStarting in 2023, brands can enter the Chinese market without funding animal cruelty. However, not every brand may qualify. Certain ingredients, products, and claims may still trigger animal tests during the registration process, and post-market testing involving animals, while rare, is still a possibility.\nTo avoid animal testing in China, companies must meet specific criteria:\n*   Sell only \u2018general\u2019 cosmetics in China (such as makeup, skincare, haircare, nail polish, and perfumes).\n*   Avoid selling \u2018special\u2019 cosmetics like sunscreens or hair dye.\n*   Refrain from selling products for infants, children, pregnant or breastfeeding individuals, or products containing \u2018New Cosmetic Ingredients.\u2019\n*   Have a policy in place to recall products if post-market testing is required rather than allowing them to be tested on animals.\nFurthermore, products can avoid animal testing in China if they are manufactured in...[Content truncated]",

Will they own up to the fact that they haven't been cruelty-free since 2012? That they agreed to fund animal tests in China?\nNot at all. Instead, we're greeted with this page:\n]\nFirst, the big bold headline:\n### \"Working Toward a Cruelty-Free World\"\nThis is blatant manipulation. They're trying to make their brand look like the good guy, and they're implying that they're cruelty-free. If MAC is \"working towards a cruelty-free world\", we would tend to assume that they must be cruelty-free.\nBut logically, it's not necessarily the case. Just because they're working towards a cruelty-free \"world\", does not mean they're cruelty-free themselves. It's clever wording to give the illusion of being cruelty-free.\n### \"M\u00b7A\u00b7C does not test on animals. We do not own any animal testing facilities and we never ask others to test on animals for us.\"\nIt's true that the company itself doesn't test on animals or own any animal testing facilities. However, the same can be said for most cosmetics companies. Animal testing for cosmetics doesn't occur at the company-level. Most often, it's done by third-parties or suppliers.\nMAC also claims that they don't \"ask others\" to test on animals on their behalf. Well, I didn't ask for that spider to be on my shower curtain the other day, but it happened regardless.\nClaiming that they don't \"ask\" others to test on animals is a trick companies use. It makes them sound ethical, but it's meaningless.\n### \"While some governments conduct animal testing to prove safety before they will allow us to sell our products, M\u00b7A\u00b7C has never tested on animals and we continue to be a leader in the movement to end animal testing globally.\"\nMAC is talking about China here. Notice how they didn't claim to sell their products in China, or to fund animal testing in China. They're shifting the blame towards \"some governments\". \"Some governments\" perform animal testing, but definitely not MAC. Haven't you heard? Mac is working towards a cruelty-free world!!!

For a long time, one of the most well-known cruelty-free brands has been MAC Cosmetics. It was also a common rumor in the vegan community that all of their products are also vegan. Sadly, things have changed and MAC Cosmetics is no longer cruelty-free.\nKnown for their bright and bold collections as well as their wide range of classic shades, MAC seems to have something to offer to everyone. This is why they have been such a popular and iconic brand over the years. They have always heavily marketed that they are cruelty-free as well. Sadly, the\u00a0MAC Cosmetics cruelty-free stance has changed. Keep reading for more details.\nIs\u00a0MAC Cosmetics no longer cruelty-free?\n========================================\nMAC Cosmetics is not cruelty-free.\nMAC Cosmetics is owned by Estee Lauder. This cosmetics giant has openly tested on animals for a long time and has recently come under fire for conducting secret tests on cosmetics in China. It was this controversy that sparked me to check in with MAC about their status as a cruelty-free company who offers vegan options. By some standards, MAC being owned by Estee Lauder is enough to not consider them cruelty-free. However, I\u2019ve always found it best to support the\u00a0cruelty-free brands and let people make their own decisions about the parent companies.\n**Sadly, in my recent response from MAC, I noticed a change that affects their status as a cruelty-free company.** In order for Logical Harmony to promote a company as cruelty-free, I want to make sure that there is no testing on animals at any point during the production of the products or in the materials used to create the products. This includes by the company itself or third parties that may provide ingredients. If a company can\u2019t give a straight response to those questions, I don\u2019t endorse them and I don\u2019t feature them on Logical Harmony.\nNormally I post the entire email response from companies, but this email from MAC has a disclosure that prohibits me from doing so without permission. I have emailed asking for permission to copy the entire email but have received no reply. So I am only going to re-post one sentence here, and it\u2019s the only sentence that matters.\n> _**M.A.C has a longstanding policy to not test on animals, nor ask others to test on our behalf, except when required by law.**_\n\u201cExcept when required by law\u201d is a phrase often used by brands who are selling their products in markets...[Content truncated]",
