They're trying to make their brand look like the good guy, and they're implying that they're cruelty-free. If MAC is \"working towards a cruelty-free world\", we would tend to assume that they must be cruelty-free.\nBut logically, it's not necessarily the case. Just because they're working towards a cruelty-free \"world\", does not mean they're cruelty-free themselves. It's clever wording to give the illusion of being cruelty-free.\n### \"M·A·C does not test on animals. We do not own any animal testing facilities and we never ask others to test on animals for us.\"\nIt's true that the company itself doesn't test on animals or own any animal testing facilities. However, the same can be said for most cosmetics companies. Animal testing for cosmetics doesn't occur at the company-level. Most often, it's done by third-parties or suppliers.\nMAC also claims that they don't \"ask others\" to test on animals on their behalf. Well, I didn't ask for that spider to be on my shower curtain the other day, but it happened regardless.\nClaiming that they don't \"ask\" others to test on animals is a trick companies use. It makes them sound ethical, but it's meaningless.\n### \"While some governments conduct animal testing to prove safety before they will allow us to sell our products, M·A·C has never tested on animals and we continue to be a leader in the movement to end animal testing globally.\"\nMAC is talking about China here. Notice how they didn't claim to sell their products in China, or to fund animal testing in China. They're shifting the blame towards \"some governments\". \"Some governments\" perform animal testing, but definitely not MAC. Haven't you heard? Mac is working towards a cruelty-free world!!!

    "QA": {
        "Question": "Does the video show MAC Cosmetics testing on cats or just a veterinary procedure?",
        "Answer": "The video does not show MAC Cosmetics testing on cats; rather, it depicts a routine veterinary procedure involving a cat in a clinical setting. In the video, the actions are consistent with medical care typically provided by veterinarians or technicians, such as cutting the cat's paw and securing a band on it, which suggests a standard medical examination or treatment rather than any form of product testing by a cosmetics company. The video’s focus on medical procedures and the presence of veterinary equipment further emphasizes this point, indicating that the cat is under proper care within a veterinary context, not as part of cosmetic testing. Furthermore, MAC Cosmetics is positioned as a brand that does not test on animals itself but may be involved with regulations in countries like China that require animal testing for cosmetic products. Current information shows that MAC states they do not own any animal testing facilities and do not ask others to test on animals on their behalf, while also being clear about the involvement of some governments in animal testing. Although MAC has faced criticism regarding its claim to be cruelty-free due to its sale in markets with mandatory testing, there is no evidence in the video that links MAC Cosmetics to testing on cats.",
