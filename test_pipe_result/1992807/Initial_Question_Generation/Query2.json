There’s something magical about the glint of a new hair accessory, the creamy swipe of a fresh tube of MAC Ruby Woo, the way you feel when you finally master a messy, but not-too-messy bun (has the royal embargo on that secret lifted yet, Meghan?).”\n!\nOver the last decade, I’ve been working to spread my glittery, no-rules message about beauty from the pages of Allure and Refinery29 to consumers and artists in 105 countries in my current role as the Executive Director of Global Trend for MAC Cosmetics.\nNot only am I an expert in cosmetics (I test, sniff, and swatch every product that crosses my desk), but I also have a deep understanding of the culture and psychology of beauty and the way it shapes us and the world we live in. Through a combination of art, science, and the relationships I've built in my 10+ years working in the beauty industry, I can predict trends before they happen and then track and amplify them across the globe. You might have spotted me talking about them on Good Morning America, CBS News, KTLA, Brides, and Who What Wear.\nI have a lifetime of experience in taking a dream and turning it into a full-fledged reality. And I’ve got a few awards on the shelf — from Glossy, Webby, the Society Of Publication Designers, and the Fragrance Foundation — to prove it.\nSo grab a drink, swipe on your favorite lip gloss, and make your way around the party. There’s plenty of entertaining cocktail stories, celebrity guests, and tried-and-true product picks. And if you stick around long enough, we might just order drunk pizza.\n!",

It's infuriating to witness these huge companies mislead their own customers using clever phrasing and buzzwords.\nSo, let's break down the cruelty-free statement on their website and set the record straight.\nOn MAC's official site, if you scroll to the botton, you can find a link titled \"Animal Testing\" in the \"About\" section.\n!\nSounds promising. Will they own up to the fact that they haven't been cruelty-free since 2012? That they agreed to fund animal tests in China?\nNot at all. Instead, we're greeted with this page:\n]\nFirst, the big bold headline:\n### \"Working Toward a Cruelty-Free World\"\nThis is blatant manipulation. They're trying to make their brand look like the good guy, and they're implying that they're cruelty-free. If MAC is \"working towards a cruelty-free world\", we would tend to assume that they must be cruelty-free.\nBut logically, it's not necessarily the case. Just because they're working towards a cruelty-free \"world\", does not mean they're cruelty-free themselves. It's clever wording to give the illusion of being cruelty-free.\n### \"M·A·C does not test on animals. We do not own any animal testing facilities and we never ask others to test on animals for us.\"\nIt's true that the company itself doesn't test on animals or own any animal testing facilities. However, the same can be said for most cosmetics companies. Animal testing for cosmetics doesn't occur at the company-level. Most often, it's done by third-parties or suppliers.\nMAC also claims that they don't \"ask others\" to test on animals on their behalf. Well, I didn't ask for that spider to be on my shower curtain the other day, but it happened regardless.\nClaiming that they don't \"ask\" others to test on animals is a trick companies use. It makes them sound ethical, but it's meaningless.\n### \"While some governments conduct animal testing to prove safety before they will allow us to sell our products, M·A·C has never tested on animals and we continue to be a leader in the movement to end animal testing globally.\"\nMAC is talking about China here. Notice how they didn't claim to sell their products in China, or to fund animal testing in China. They're shifting the blame towards \"some governments\". \"Some governments\" perform animal testing, but definitely not MAC. Haven't you...[Content truncated]",

Like Lorde\n=============================================\nOr, how to style yourself like a witch for summer.\n*   Author:\n*   Publish date:\n    Jun 5, 2014\n*   \n*   \n*   \nYou know how in \"Mean Girls,\" the Plastics make it a rule to wear pink every Wednesday? I have something like that, too. It's called \"Dress Like A Witch Friday\" (#DLAWF). I've been doing it every fall since junior year of college, but to be honest, it extends well past autumn. Due to some combination of frequent visits to Salem, Mass and spending too much time in a friend's basement with a Ouija board as a kid, I've always aspired to a certain level of ghoulishness in my personal styling. I don't know. I'm a terrible WASP.\nSo you can imagine my excitement when MAC Cosmetics  with everyone's favorite teen witch, Lorde, back in March. The collection — all two pieces of it — . In the name of science, I swung by the MAC Pro Store in Manhattan's Flatiron District to give it a test drive/get my makeup professionally did.\n**The Look:**\nDespite the delightfully steamy New York heat, MAC makeup artist Keri Blair and I decided to go balls-out on a full face: Primer, foundation, powder, contouring, brow pencil, highlighter, eye shadow, winged liner, opaque lipstick, lip liner.

Pro tip: Tilda Swinton fangirls hoping to terrify their loved ones should stop at the foundation and skip mascara.\nIn our pursuit of a heavy, gothy look, the Penultimate Eyeliner in Rapidblack and the Pure Heroine lipstick needed some supporting products. The lipstick is creamy to the point of smeary when applied thick enough, and the edges started to bleed slightly, so Blair recommended using a lipliner (like MAC's lip pencil in ) to lock that sucker in. Maybe trace along the edge of your lip with a powder foundation once you're done to prevent feathering.\nScroll to Continue\nRecommended Articles\n--------------------\n]\n]\n]\nSimilarly, Blair ended up using a liquid eyeliner in addition to the Penultimate pen, noting that it's a bit harder to apply on other people than it is on oneself.

For dessert, I purchased cookies that a local bakery packed in the type of paper bags sometimes treated with PFAS, and the chemicals may have been in my tap water and fish.\nBut PFAS, dubbed “forever chemicals” because they don’t naturally break down, aren’t only lurking in the kitchen. The synthetic compounds are often used to make thousands of everyday products water, stain and grease resistant, and they’re popular with manufacturers across dozens of industries because they’re so effective. That’s a problem because the class of about 4,700 compounds is linked to serious health problems like cancer, heart disease, birth defects, liver disease and decreased immunity.\nThe extent of PFAS contamination is only now coming into focus – studies have found drinking water supplies for well over 100 million people across demographic lines may be contaminated by the chemicals. It’s estimated that they’re present in 97% of Americans’ blood, and public health advocates are just starting to understand how widespread their use is in everyday products.\nResearch has found that PFAS might also be in my dental floss, waterproof boots, umbrella, mattress pad, bike chain lube, cellphone, clothing, camping gear and more. They’re used in a range of personal care products from moisturizer to bar soap to cosmetics by a number of brands. Meanwhile, my couch and carpet may have been treated with Scotchgard or other stain guards that use PFAS to make products stain resistant.\nThe more I dug into the chemicals’ myriad uses, the more I found that I’m potentially exposed to them in nearly every facet of daily life in my house.\nI soon began to scan my home for products that potentially contained them and anxiously wondered: “Am I being poisoned by a steady drip of PFAS?”\nI set out to answer that question by checking dozens of household items, my tap water and blood samples from my cat, Ling Ling, and me for the chemicals. I sent the results to toxicologists and PFAS researchers who provided insight on what they mean and helped answer my question. The testing was performed by two independent laboratories that are among the few nationwide that can conduct such analyses.\nTesting confirmed that my and Ling Ling’s blood is contaminated with PFAS. The levels for several compounds are what Graham Peaslee, a University of Notre Dame PFAS researcher, called “unusually high” and at quantities at which toxicologists say they start seeing links to health problems. Some experts who reviewed the results said they believe a case that I am being slowly poisoned could be made, but they also cautioned that PFAS’s presence...[Content truncated]",
