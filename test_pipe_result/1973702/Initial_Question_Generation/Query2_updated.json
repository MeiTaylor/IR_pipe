This litigation had mixed results. New York's noncitizen voting law was overturned in 2022. San Francisco's law was upheld on appeal in 2023.\n\nIn 2018, North Dakota became the first of several states to ban noncitizen voting by changing their constitutions. North Dakotans for Citizen Voting, the group that sponsored Measure 2, supported the ballot measure in posts on its website:[8]\n\n\nOpponents of Measure 2, including Steven Morrison, a law professor at the University of North Dakota, stated that the measure was unnecessary, \u201cPractically speaking, I don\u2019t see how this would change anything. The question is do you have non-residents, non-citizens voting now?\u201d[10]\n\nAfter North Dakota, other states passed bans on noncitizen voting, including Alabama (2020), Colorado (2022), Arizona (2022), Florida (2022), Louisiana (2023), and Ohio (2023). Voters in four additional states are deciding similar ballot measure bans in 2024: Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, and South Carolina.\n\nThe map below indicates which U.S. states allow or prohibit noncitizen voting in elections for state or local offices. It also indicates which states have approved ballot measures related to noncitizen voting and which states will have ballot measures related to noncitizen voting in the 2024 election. States with no impediments to voting in local elections are also indicated on this map.\n\n\n\nAs of June 2024, the District of Columbia and municipalities in California, Maryland, and Vermont allowed noncitizens to vote in some or all local elections. Details about each municipality are listed below. Know of a municipality we're missing? Email us.\n\nThe District of Columbia Council passed the D.C. Noncitizen Vote Act in October 2022, allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections. Due to the District's non-state status, all of its legislation must be reviewed by Congress prior to adoption. The D.C. Noncitizen Vote Act overcame bipartisan opposition in the U.S. House of Representatives and passed its congressional review in March 2023.[13]\n\nAdvocates of the law argued that noncitizens have an interest in schools, public safety and other issues, and should therefore be allowed to weigh in on public policy decisions. Opponents argued that noncitizens do not have a fundamental right to vote or hold public office in the U.S. and that the legislation dilutes the voting power of U.S. citizens.[14]\n\nIn March 2023, a group of seven D...[Content truncated]",

Those cities now allow all residents over age 18 to vote in city elections, regardless of citizenship status. Noncitizen voting in federal elections remains illegal nationwide.\nThe movement to let all adults vote in local elections hasn\u2019t had widespread success in modern times. Until lately, just San Francisco and nine Maryland cities have allowed noncitizens to vote in local or school board elections. While two towns in Massachusetts have passed resolutions in recent years calling for noncitizens to be allowed to vote locally, the state legislature has yet to approve those changes. But those cities may soon have company.\nLawmakers in Washington, D.C., Illinois and New York City this year are considering legislation that would offer the vote to noncitizens for local elections, such as for city council or the school board. These proposals have ignited the fierce debates that often come with immigration and voting rights proposals. Some states, meanwhile, have gone in the opposite direction in recent years, explicitly banning noncitizens from voting.\nIn Vermont, legislative proponents pointed out that noncitizens are taxpayers, arguing they deserve a say in who represents them.\n\u201cPeople always glom onto the idea that you have to earn our right to vote...[Content truncated]",

The study \u2014 which would presumably lead to a ballot measure \u2014 was delayed by the pandemic but will be revived as school reopens.  \nThere\u2019s no question that noncitizen voting rights is a radical notion. It\u2019s understandably worrisome to those who believe citizenship matters.  \nAnd you don\u2019t have to be a xenophobe or a white nationalist or a Trump voter to feel that way.  \nA few years ago, then-Gov. Jerry Brown, whose liberal credentials are pretty impeccable,  passed by the California Legislature that would have allowed permanent legal residents to serve on juries, saying: \u201cJury service, like voting, is quintessentially a prerogative and responsibility of citizenship.\u201d  \nCitizenship is a concept, a construct \u2014 but it\u2019s a meaningful one.

Porzio ruled that the new law conflicted with constitutional guidelines and state law stating that only eligible citizens can vote. To give noncitizens a right to vote would require a referendum, the judge wrote.\nThe law only applied to municipal elections and was not set to go into effect until January of next year. The ruling will have no effect on Tuesday\u2019s primary election in New York.\n\u201cThe New York State Constitution expressly states that citizens meeting the age and residency requirements are entitled to register and vote in elections,\u201d the judge wrote in his ruling. \u201cThere is no statutory ability for the City of New York to issue inconsistent laws permitting noncitizens to vote and exceed the authority granted to it by the New York State Constitution.\u201d\nWhen it passed the legislation, New York City became the largest city in the country to grant noncitizens the right to vote, inserting itself at the forefront of an increasingly polarized national debate about voting rights, as some states began to expand eligibility while others went in the other direction, moving to explicitly bar noncitizens from voting.\n* * *\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
