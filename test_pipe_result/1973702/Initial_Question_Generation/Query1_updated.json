This fact sheet explains the nature of parole, how parole requests are considered, who may qualify, and what parole programs currently exist.\n**What is Parole?**\n-------------------\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to exercise discretion to temporarily allow certain noncitizens to physically enter or remain in the United States if they are applying for admission but do not have a legal basis for being admitted.\u00a0DHS may only grant parole if the agency determines that there are urgent humanitarian or significant public benefit reasons for a person to be in the United States, and that person merits a favorable exercise of discretion.\u00a0Grants of parole are made for limited periods of time, often to accomplish a discrete purpose, and individuals are typically expected to depart the United States when the authorized period expires unless another form of status or relief is conferred.\nWhile individuals who receive a grant of parole are allowed to enter the United States, they are not provided with an immigration status nor are they formally \u201cadmitted\u201d into the country for purposes of immigration law. An admission occurs when an immigration officer allows a noncitizen to enter the United States pursuant to a visa or another entry document, without the limitation of parole. The distinction between an admission and parole is a significant one under immigration law.\n**Who Has Authority to Grant Parole?**\n--------------------------------------\nThe Secretary of Homeland Security has delegated parole authority to the three immigration agencies within DHS: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\nUSCIS adjudicates many of the parole requests made by individuals seeking to enter the United States for humanitarian reasons, while ICE typically handles parole requests related to court hearings or intelligence matters, as well as parole from immigration detention. ICE has separate jurisdiction over decisions about whether or not to parole detained individuals out of ICE custody, including \u201carriving aliens\u201d who establish a credible fear of persecution or torture.\u00a0CBP has authority to make parole decisions at ports of entry. For example, it can parole noncitizens fleeing persecution and who wish to apply for asylum. It may also parole individuals for \u201cdeferred inspection,\u201d which means that they permit an individual to enter the United States, but they schedule a subsequent interview to address unresolved issues about their admissibility.\n**What is Humanitarian Parole?**\n--------------------------------\nWhile humanitarian parole is explicitly authorized by the INA for \u201curgent humanitarian reasons,\u201d there is no statutory or regulatory definition of an \u201curgent humanitarian reason.\u201d USCIS has stated, however, that it will consider factors such as the time-sensitivity of the circumstances and the degree of suffering that may result if parole is not authorized.\u00a0According to USCIS, examples of...[Content truncated]",

Which perception is accurate? With the Obama presidency just ended, a closer examination demonstrates the administration\u2019s record is more nuanced than either criticism would imply.\nCarefully calibrated revisions to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) immigration enforcement priorities and practices achieved two goals: Increasing penalties against unauthorized border crossers by putting far larger shares into formal removal proceedings rather than voluntarily returning them across the border, as had been longstanding practice; and making noncitizens with criminal records the top enforcement target. While there were fewer removals and returns under the Obama administration than each of the two prior administrations (see Table 1), those declines must be understood against the backdrop of a significant reduction in border apprehensions that resulted from a sharp decrease in unauthorized inflows, in particular of Mexicans. Analysts have attributed this trend, which began under the Bush administration, to improved economic conditions in Mexico, reduced postrecession job demand in the United States, ramped-up enforcement, and the increased use of different enforcement tactics at the border.\nThe enforcement priorities and policies, which evolved over the years, represented a significant departure from those of the Bush and Clinton administrations. As detailed below, the Obama-era policies represented the culmination of a gradual but consistent effort to narrow its enforcement focus to two key groups: The deportation of criminals and recent unauthorized border crossers.\nThe most recent enforcement figures released by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on December 30 offer the latest evidence of these trends. Eighty-five percent of all removals and returns during fiscal year (FY) 2016 were of noncitizens who had recently crossed the U.S. border unlawfully. Of the remainder, who were removed from the U.S. interior, more than 90 percent had been convicted of what DHS defines as serious crimes.\nBorder apprehensions and removals increased in FY 2016 compared to the prior year, DHS reported. In FY 2016, DHS carried out 530,250 apprehensions and 344,354 removals, compared to 462,388 apprehensions and 333,341 removals a year earlier. Despite the increase, these numbers were far lower than the peak of enforcement operations at the beginning of the Obama years, after he inherited a robust enforcement regime from his predecessors. These numbers dipped as new enforcement priorities were put in place,...[Content truncated]",

Trump\u2019s musings are reflected on social media, with the phrase \u201cthey are importing voters\u201d spread across X, formerly known as Twitter, by many users (including the site\u2019s owner, Elon Musk).\nTrump\u2019s fearmongering about votes allegedly cast by noncitizens is not new. But fresh research by a professor often cited by Trump\u2019s supporters further undercuts his claims.\nAfter he was elected president, with a narrow margin in the electoral college, he insisted (without evidence) that the reason Hillary Clinton won 2.8 million more votes was that at least 3 million votes were cast by undocumented immigrants.\nWhen Trump lost the 2020 election \u2014 where, by the popular vote count, Biden beat him by 7 million votes \u2014 Trump claimed that Biden\u2019s margin of victory in key states, such as in Arizona, was provided by noncitizens. Biden won Arizona by just over 10,000 votes, and Trump falsely said that 36,000 noncitizens had voted in the state.\nTrump\u2019s reiteration of that claim in his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, to supporters who later attacked the Capitol is referenced in the federal indictment accusing him of conspiring to overturn the election results.\n...[Content truncated]",

This report, which was developed in collaboration with the American Psychological Association and a panel of behavioral health experts, is the first federal in-depth review of conversion therapy.
