Although such participation is a violation of election laws in most parts of the United States, enforcement depends principally on disclosure of citizenship status at the time of voter registration. This study examines participation rates by non-citizens using a nationally representative sample that includes non-citizen immigrants. We find that some non-citizens participate in U.S. elections, and that this participation has been large enough to change meaningful election outcomes including Electoral College votes, and Congressional elections. Non-citizen votes likely gave Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass  and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress.\nIntroduction\n------------\nThis analysis provides some of the first available nationwide estimates of the portion of non-citizen immigrants who vote in U.S. elections.

                "content": "Barack Obama was famously labeled “deporter in chief” by critics in the immigrant-rights community, even as enforcement-first advocates accused his administration of being soft on unauthorized immigrants. Which perception is accurate? With the Obama presidency just ended, a closer examination demonstrates the administration’s record is more nuanced than either criticism would imply.\nCarefully calibrated revisions to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) immigration enforcement priorities and practices achieved two goals: Increasing penalties against unauthorized border crossers by putting far larger shares into formal removal proceedings rather than voluntarily returning them across the border, as had been longstanding practice; and making noncitizens with criminal records the top enforcement target. While there were fewer removals and returns under the Obama administration than each of the two prior administrations (see Table 1), those declines must be understood against the backdrop of a significant reduction in border apprehensions that resulted from a sharp decrease in unauthorized inflows, in particular of Mexicans. Analysts have attributed this trend, which began under the Bush administration, to improved economic conditions in Mexico, reduced postrecession job demand in the United States, ramped-up enforcement, and the increased use of different enforcement tactics at the border.\nThe enforcement priorities and policies, which evolved over the years, represented a significant departure from those of the Bush and Clinton administrations. As detailed below, the Obama-era policies represented the culmination of a gradual but consistent effort to narrow its enforcement focus to two key groups: The deportation of criminals and recent unauthorized border crossers.\nThe most recent enforcement figures released by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on December 30 offer the latest evidence of these trends. Eighty-five percent of all removals and returns during fiscal year (FY) 2016 were of noncitizens who had recently crossed the U.S. border unlawfully. Of the remainder, who were removed from the U.S. interior, more than 90 percent had been convicted of what DHS defines as serious crimes.\nBorder apprehensions and removals increased in FY 2016 compared to the prior year, DHS reported. In FY 2016, DHS carried out 530,250 apprehensions and 344,354 removals, compared to 462,388 apprehensions and 333,341 removals a year earlier. Despite the increase, these numbers were far lower than the peak of enforcement operations at the beginning of the Obama years, after he inherited a robust enforcement regime from his predecessors. These numbers dipped as new enforcement priorities were put in place,...[Content truncated]",

I think they are looking for votes.”\n— Former president Donald Trump, in remarks in Eagle Pass, Tex., Feb. 29\n“That’s why they are allowing these people to come in — people that don’t speak our language — they are signing them up to vote.”\n— Trump, in remarks during a rally in Sioux Center, Iowa, Jan. 5\nDecrying the surge of undocumented immigrants at the southern border, Trump has suggested a nefarious reason for it — a desire by President Biden to tip the 2024 vote by enlisting migrants to cast ballots. Trump’s musings are reflected on social media, with the phrase “they are importing voters” spread across X, formerly known as Twitter, by many users (including the site’s owner, Elon Musk).\nTrump’s fearmongering about votes allegedly cast by noncitizens is not new. But fresh research by a professor often cited by Trump’s supporters further undercuts his claims.\nAfter he was elected president, with a narrow margin in the electoral college, he insisted (without evidence) that the reason Hillary Clinton won 2.8 million more votes was that at least 3 million votes were cast by undocumented immigrants.\nWhen Trump lost the 2020 election — where, by the popular vote count, Biden beat him by 7 million votes — Trump claimed that Biden’s margin of victory in key states, such as in Arizona, was provided by noncitizens. Biden won Arizona by just over 10,000 votes, and Trump falsely said that 36,000 noncitizens had voted in the state.\nTrump’s reiteration of that claim in his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, to supporters who later attacked the Capitol is referenced in the federal indictment accusing him of conspiring to overturn the election results.\n...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "Did the Obama Administration legally change voting regulations to allow non-citizens to vote?",
        "Answer": "The Obama Administration did not legally change voting regulations to allow non-citizens to vote. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:\n\n1. **Federal and State Laws**: Only U.S. citizens are permitted to vote in federal and statewide elections. Potential voters must affirm their citizenship under penalty of perjury to register, and states implement measures to ensure noncitizens are not on their voter registration lists. There is currently no evidence that the issue of noncitizen voting is significant, as efforts to prove its occurrence have largely failed [Query 2_evidence_1].\n\n2. **Court Rulings**: Recent court decisions, such as the ruling against New York City's non-citizen voting law, have reinforced that voting rights are reserved exclusively for U.S. citizens. This ruling indicates a judicial consensus against noncitizen voting, demonstrating that any push towards allowing noncitizen voting meets significant legal challenges [Query 2_evidence_2].\n\n3. **No Legal Foundation for Claims**: Claims regarding the Obama Administration's support for noncitizen voting lack substantive legal backing. The support for organizations like the NAACP and the League of Women Voters, as referenced in the video, was related to broader voting rights issues, but it did not lead to a change in federal law permitting noncitizen voting [Video_information].\n\nIn conclusion, the Obama Administration did not change the legal framework to allow non-citizen voting, and the federal legal framework remains that only U.S. citizens may vote in elections.",
