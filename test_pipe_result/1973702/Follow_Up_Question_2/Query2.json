NAACP Records, Manuscript Division, Library of Congress (107.00.00)  Courtesy of the NAACP\nThe NAACP’s legal strategy against segregated education culminated in the 1954 Supreme Court’s landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision. African Americans gained the formal, if not the practical, right to study alongside their white peers in primary and secondary schools. The decision fueled an intransigent, violent resistance during which Southern states used a variety of tactics to evade the law.\nIn the summer of 1955, a surge of anti-black violence included the kidnapping and brutal murder of fourteen-year-old Emmett Till, a crime that provoked widespread and assertive protests from black and white Americans. By December 1955, the Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott led by Martin Luther King, Jr., began a protracted campaign of nonviolent civil disobedience to protest segregation that attracted national and international attention.\nDuring 1956, a group of Southern senators and congressmen signed the “Southern Manifesto,” vowing resistance to racial integration by all “lawful means.” Resistance heightened in 1957–1958 during the crisis over integration at Little Rock’s Central High School. At the same time, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights led a successful drive for passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and continued to press for even stronger legislation. NAACP Youth Council chapters staged sit-ins at whites-only lunch counters, sparking a movement against segregation in public accommodations throughout the South in 1960. Nonviolent direct action increased during the presidency of John F. Kennedy, beginning with the 1961 Freedom Rides.\nHundreds of demonstrations erupted in cities and towns across the nation. National and international media coverage of the use of fire hoses and attack dogs against child protesters precipitated a crisis in the Kennedy administration, which it could not ignore. The bombings and riots in Birmingham, Alabama, on May 11, 1963, compelled Kennedy to call in federal troops.\nOn June 19, 1963, the president sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress. The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28 roused public support for the pending bill. After the president’s assassination on November 22, the fate of Kennedy’s bill was in the hands of his vice president and successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, and the United States Congress.\nSee timeline for this period\nRoy Wilkins (1901−1981) was born in St. Louis, the son of a minister.

Continuation of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program \nWHEREAS, on June 15th, 2012 under the Obama Administration, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, under which undocumented young people who came into the United States as children and meet several guidelines may request a deferral of deportation for a period of two years, subject to renewal; and \nWHEREAS, DACA has allowed approximately 800,000 people who were brought into the United States illegally as children to remain in the country provided that they are working and/or going to school and meet other eligibility requirements; and \nWHEREAS, there are an estimated 1.3 million people who meet DACA criteria and could have applied for the program; and \nWHEREAS, DACA recipients are people who have grown up in the U.S., are in college, own businesses, pay taxes, and contribute to society; and \nWHEREAS, the DACA program was created to give Congress time to pass the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act, which would offer those who were brought to the U.S. as children the opportunity to potentially gain permanent legal residency; and \nWHEREAS, Congress has yet to enact such legislation; and 2018 RESOLUTIONS 54 \nWHEREAS, on September 5, 2017, the Trump Administration unlawfully announced plans to rescind the DACA program and to not accept new applications; and \nWHEREAS, if Congress does not come up with a solution, recipients will lose protection when their two-year statuses expire, making them vulnerable to deportation; and \nWHEREAS, an estimated 200,000 U.S citizen children born to DACA participants and DACA-eligible residents risk losing their parents to deportation if the DACA program is terminated, and such deportation would lead to extreme hardships for such children who are U.S. citizens; and \nWHEREAS, the NAACP has filed a federal lawsuit to halt the above-stated consequences. \nTHEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the NAACP strongly supports legal and political action to extend DACA; and \nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that all NAACP branches should immediately identify DACA-eligible individuals who are NAACP members and submit their names to the National Legal Department immediately; and \nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the NAACP supports the passage of the DREAM Act to allow a path towards citizenship for “Dreamers.” \n3.

Our rights to fully participate in democracy and in social and economic life depend on the Court. From _**Brown v. Board of Education**_to **_Shelby County v. Holder_**, we have seen the power of the Supreme Court to both advance and undermine civil rights and equal justice under law. Each year, the Court decides critical cases involving voting rights, equal educational opportunity, fair employment and housing, women's rights, access to health care, immigration, consumer rights, environmental justice, and criminal justice. These decisions directly impact our lives and the lives of our families and generations to come.\nOn February 25, 2022, President Biden nominated Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be the 116th Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. She would be the first Black woman justice ever to serve on the Court. Since 1789, **115 justices have served and all but six have been white men.** Lyndon Johnson appointed Thurgood Marshall, the first Black justice, in 1967, and Ronald Reagan appointed the first woman, Sandra Day O'Connor, in 1981.\nRepresentation of a Black woman on the Supreme Court is long overdue. Judge Jackson's presence and voice on the Court will enrich its perspective and decision-making. A more diverse bench will help the Court better serve the nation's broad, diverse populations who are impacted by its rulings.

For more than a century, the NAACP’s leaders, members, and supporters have been defined and distinguished by your unyielding determination to do what you believe is right. And I want to tell you how much I appreciate, and am inspired by, the example of strength that this organization continues to provide for our nation – and for me personally.\nThis convention is focused on issues of real consequence – issues that directly affect people’s lives and influence our nation’s course. So, today – like all of you – I’d like to focus on the future.
