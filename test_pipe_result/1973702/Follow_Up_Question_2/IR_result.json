Thousands of people joined along the way to Montgomery, with roughly 25,000 people entering the capital on the final leg of the march. On March 25, the marchers made it to the entrance of the Alabama State Capitol building, with a petition for Gov. George Wallace.\nOnly a few months later, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, which President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law on August 6, 1965. The Voting Rights Act was designed to eliminate legal barriers at the state and local level that prevented African Americans from exercising their right to vote under the 15th Amendment — after nearly a century of unconstitutional discrimination.\nListen to stories from those who were there:\n--------------------------------------------\nLast month, the President invited a number of people connected to the marches to attend a Black History Month reception here at the White House.\nWe talked with some of them about their experiences -- and their stories are nothing short of inspirational.\n**Listen as they talk about their experiences leading up to the marches:**\n**Some of them also gave us their thoughts on the challenges facing today's generation:**\n**And they explained what it meant to them to be invited to the White House:**\nHow will you #MarchOn?\n----------------------\nOn August 6, 1965 — just a few months after the march — President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law, to prohibit racial discrimination in voting. The act itself has been called the most effective piece of civil rights legislation ever passed by Congress.\n**But the work is far from done.** Today's generation still faces a number of challenges, and we must be as committed to change today as we were then.\n!\n_This form is now closed._\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThank You\nYou told the President you're in —  \nnow let your friends know, too."

Mr. Holder is an internationally recognized leader on a broad range of legal issues and a staunch advocate for civil rights. He served in the Obama Administration as the 82nd Attorney General of the United States from February 2009 to April 2015, the third longest-serving Attorney General in U.S. history and the first African American to hold that office.\nUnder Mr. Holder’s leadership, civil rights, including voting rights, were a top priority at the Justice Department. Mr. Holder vigorously defended voting rights, including the enforcement of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He criticized politically motivated voter ID laws that were designed to suppress minority and youth votes, and he led the Justice Department’s efforts to overturn these laws around the country.\n!\n!\n> **“The biggest rigged system in America is gerrymandering.**  \n> Together we can change that and restore fairness to our democracy.

        "Question": "What legal arguments did the Obama Administration present to support voting rights advocacy organizations such as the NAACP?",
        "Answer": "The Obama Administration's support for voting rights advocacy organizations such as the NAACP was grounded in several key legal arguments:\n\n1. **Reinforcement of the Voting Rights Act**: The Obama Administration emphasized its commitment to uphold and enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits racial discrimination in voting. This act has been recognized as a fundamental piece of civil rights legislation essential to protecting voter access, especially for marginalized communities. By reinforcing the principles of the Voting Rights Act, the Administration aligned itself with organizations like the NAACP that fight against systemic barriers to voting for minority populations.\n\n2. **Opposition to Voter Suppression Laws**: Under Attorney General Eric Holder’s leadership, the Justice Department took a firm stance against voter ID laws and other measures perceived as efforts to suppress votes among minorities and younger voters. Holder criticized these laws as politically motivated and led initiatives to challenge them, thereby supporting the advocacy work of organizations aiming to protect voting rights by ensuring that all eligible voters could exercise their right to vote without undue obstacles.\n\n3. **Restoration of Voting Rights for Disenfranchised Individuals**: The Administration also advocated for the restoration of voting rights for individuals who had completed their criminal sentences. This initiative sought to rectify the disenfranchisement of millions, particularly among African American communities, which was a focus of the NAACP's mission. This legal argument aligned with broader civil rights principles advocating for equality and non-discrimination in electoral participation.\n\nIn conclusion, the legal arguments put forth by the Obama Administration in support of voting rights advocacy organizations were firmly rooted in a commitment to enforce civil rights laws, protect against voter suppression, and restore voting rights to disenfranchised groups. Together, these efforts underscored the Administration's broader objective of ensuring equitable access to the democratic process.",
