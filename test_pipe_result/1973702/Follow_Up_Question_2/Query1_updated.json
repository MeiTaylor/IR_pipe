Thousands of people joined along the way to Montgomery, with roughly 25,000 people entering the capital on the final leg of the march. On March 25, the marchers made it to the entrance of the Alabama State Capitol building, with a petition for Gov. George Wallace.\nOnly a few months later, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, which President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law on August 6, 1965. The Voting Rights Act was designed to eliminate legal barriers at the state and local level that prevented African Americans from exercising their right to vote under the 15th Amendment \u2014 after nearly a century of unconstitutional discrimination.\nListen to stories from those who were there:\n--------------------------------------------\nLast month, the President invited a number of people connected to the marches to attend a Black History Month reception here at the White House.\nWe talked with some of them about their experiences -- and their stories are nothing short of inspirational.\n**Listen as they talk about their experiences leading up to the marches:**\n**Some of them also gave us their thoughts on the challenges facing today's generation:**\n**And they explained what it meant to them to be invited to the White House:**\nHow will you #MarchOn?\n----------------------\nOn August 6, 1965 \u2014 just a few months after the march \u2014 President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law, to prohibit racial discrimination in voting.

Although a cloture motion \u2014 the formal process to bring an end to a filibuster \u2014 is still necessary for legislation, the Senate adopted changes to its rules governing nominations to executive branch positions and federal judgeships. In 2013, Democrats altered filibuster rules so that only a simple majority is required to end debate on nominees to lower courts and administration positions. Jeremy W. Peters, \u201cIn Landmark Vote, Senate Limits Use of the Filibuster,\u201d _New York Times_, November 21, 2013, . In\u00a02017, Republicans extended that change to Supreme Court nominations. Matt Flegenheimer, \u201cSenate Republicans Deploy \u2018Nuclear Option\u2019 to Clear Path for Gorsuch,\u201d _New York Times,_ April 6, 2017, .\nThe Need to Abolish the Filibuster\n----------------------------------\nThe last several decades have shown that our democracy is on shakier ground than many had believed. The pandemic has made it all the more clear that our system does not function well, with many avenues for delaying and hindering legislation. This dysfunction has prompted a multifaceted effort by academics, advocacy organizations, and bipartisan alliances of political leaders to shape a reform agenda to bolster our institutions. With an election in November, democracy advocates believe we must be ready to fight to achieve some, if not all, of these reforms.\nOn this agenda are many legislative initiatives that will need to pass through Congress. The Senate has been described as the world\u2019s greatest deliberative body. That hokum has been proven false over the past decades as \u201cdeliberative\u201d has become \u201cdysfunctional.\u201d Right now, the filibuster has made the Senate a graveyard of new ideas. The ability of a small group to derail legislative action has prevented senators from working across party lines to engage in bipartisan deliberation and policymaking. Without reform, if not abolition, of this rule, advocates for democracy will not be able to move their agenda into action.\nThe filibuster is a procedural tool used to delay or derail entirely the ability to conclude debate on legislation and thus come to a vote to pass or defeat it. Under Senate rules, a cloture petition is the mechanism by which a filibuster can be overcome. The cloture motion was once rarely used but has come to characterize how the Senate operates, making it difficult to enact laws without a...[Content truncated]",
