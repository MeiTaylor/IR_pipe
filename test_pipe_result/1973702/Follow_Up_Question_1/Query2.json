Since then, state lawmakers have proposed more than 500 anti-voter bills seeking to silence Black, brown, working class, and young voters, and voters with disabilities, which many of these organizations represent.\n“Our democracy is stronger when everyone can cast their vote to make their voice heard at the polls,\" said **Virginia Kase Solomón**, CEO of the League of Women Voters of the United States. \"Some politicians are attacking our freedom to vote and suppressing certain underserved populations from participating in our elections, including African Americans and Hispanic voters. This is why we support the passage of the _Freedom to Vote Act_ and the _John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act_, to ensure elections are free, fair, and accessible to all voters. The League will continue our fight to ensure all voters, especially those that have been traditionally underrepresented or underserved, have the opportunity and the information to exercise their right to vote.”\n“In 2020, we saw record voter turnout, especially among voters of color and young people, because of the work of these leading organizations. Now, a small group of elected officials fixated on maintaining their waning political power have purposely put up barriers to make it harder for some Americans to vote, jeopardizing our democracy. We will not back down. We are organizing and are preparing to fight day in and day out in 2022. And that fight starts with our collective effort to press Congress to do the right thing and pass critical voting rights legislation to protect voters and their access to the ballot box,” said **Stephanie L. Young**, Executive Director of When We All Vote.\nThe pledge also calls on corporations, the faith community, state-based voting rights organizations and nonprofit organizations to join When We All Vote, Mrs. Obama, and the signatories in pledging their own commitments to voting rights, voter registration, and voter turnout in 2022.   \nInitial signatories of the pledge include: ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge, Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote (APIAVote), Black Girls Vote, Common Cause, Deliver My Vote, Drag Out The Vote, Fair Fight Action, Faith in Public Life, Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, League of Women Voters, Mi Familia Vota, More Than A Vote, NAACP, NAACP Legal Defense Fund, National Action Network, National Bar Association Young Lawyers Division, National Urban League, National Women's Law Center, NextGen America, Protect the Sacred, RepresentUs,...[Content truncated]",

Founded in 1920, its ongoing major activities include registering voters, providing voter information, boosting voter turnout and advocating for voting rights. In addition, the LWV works with partners that share its positions and supports a variety of progressive public policy positions, including campaign finance reform, women's rights, health care reform, gun control.[1][2][3][4][5]\n\nThe League was founded as the successor to the National American Woman Suffrage Association, which had led the nationwide fight for women's suffrage. The initial goals of the League were to educate women to take part in the political process and to push forward legislation of interest to women. As a nonpartisan organization, an important part of its role in American politics has been to register and inform voters, but it also lobbies for issues of importance to its members, which are selected at its biennial conventions. Its effectiveness has been attributed to its policy of careful study and documentation of an issue before taking a position.[6][7][2]: 92, 127–161 [8] Its bylaws do not allow it to endorse candidates or political parties.

Nearly a century after the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified, Congress finally put teeth into its promise that no citizen could be denied the right to vote based on race.\nThe VRA has been among the most successful pieces of federal legislation in the history of the country.  To take just one example, in the twenty years following the law’s passage, the disparity in registration rates between white and black registration rates dropped from . Based on this success, the VRA has been reauthorized multiple times—most recently, in . The latest reauthorization passed both chambers of Congress with deep bipartisan support...[Content truncated]",

The district court rejected contentions that the challenged provisions violate the Voting Rights Act and the Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Twenty-Sixth Amendments of the Constitution. In evaluating the massive record in this case, the court issued extensive factual findings. We appreciate and commend the court on its thoroughness. The record evidence provides substantial support for many of its findings; indeed, many rest on uncontested facts. But, for some of its findings, we must conclude that the district court fundamentally erred. In holding that the legislature did not enact the challenged provisions with discriminatory intent, the court seems to have missed the forest in carefully surveying the many trees. This failure of perspective led the court to ignore critical facts bearing on legislative intent, including the inextricable link between race and politics in North Carolina. \nVoting in many areas of North Carolina is racially polarized. That is, “the race of voters correlates with the selection of a certain candidate or candidates.” Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 62 (1986) (discussing North Carolina). In Gingles and other cases brought under the Voting Rights Act, the 10 \nSupreme Court has...[Content truncated]",

Walker, Friday’s order originates from a  filed in May 2023 by Hispanic Federation, Poder Latinx and voters challenging the citizenship requirement for 3PVROs contained in the state’s most recent voter suppression legislation, . In addition to prohibiting noncitizens from assisting 3PVROs with voter registration efforts, the law imposes a $50,000 fine on organizations that violate the requirement.\nPrior to the ruling, Walker  the plaintiffs’ request to temporarily block the citizenship provision as litigation proceeds. In that July 2023 order, Walker found that the provision likely violates the U.S. Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause by “impermissibly discriminat\\ based on alienage.” State officials subsequently  the preliminary injunction ruling to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where a decision remains pending.\nAs a result of Friday’s order granting the plaintiffs’  on their Equal Protection claim, Florida’s Republican Secretary of State Cord Byrd will not be able to enforce S.B. 7050’s citizenship requirement for 3PVROs. According to the order, “the Florida Legislature chose to discriminate against all noncitizens on the face of the challenged provision” without a compelling state interest.\nWalker also denied Byrd’s request to defer a resolution of the plaintiffs’ motion until after the 11th Circuit rules on his appeal of last year’s preliminary injunction blocking the provision...[Content truncated]",

Current law mandates 12 days.\nHarless initially said the measure was necessary to help elections administrators hire workers and volunteers, saying that a 12-day early-voting period as a possible deterrent.\nBut after testimony at Monday's House Elections Committee hearing, where critics slammed its intent as little more than an effort to make casting a ballot harder for everyone, Harless said she would not ask the committee for a vote.\n“This bill wasn’t about voter suppression, it was not about limiting access to the polls,” she said. “I will be happy to pull the bill down. I think it’s perfect for an interim study.”\nNina Perales, the vice president of litigation for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, or MALDEF, said the bill would move Texas backward by limiting the number of voting days available and by creating longer lines on days when voting is permitted. She added that increased wait times would drive potential voters away.\n“The bill lacks a rational basis in election administration and will reduce voter confidence in Texas,” she testified.\nThe Texas chapter of the NAACP, the League of Women’s Voters, the Texas Democratic Party, the Tarrant County Elections Office, the Dallas County Elections Office, Disability Rights Texas and the Texas AFL-CIO also testified against the measure.\nBut B.R. “Skipper” Wallace, the chairman of the Texas Republican County Chairmen’s Association, said the bill was a good-faith effort to motivate Texans to plan better.\n“There is no magic number\" for what the number of voting days should be, he said. \"I don’t know that one week \\ is a magic number. Taxpayers pay “an extraordinary amount of money to wait to the last minute. Voters have to take some responsibility.\"\nAlso supporting the measure was Erin Anderson with True the Vote, a Houston-based conservative watchdog group that seeks, among other things, to crack down on voter fraud and increase participation at polling stations.\nSeveral citizens “want to get involved in the process, but two weeks discourages them to do so,” Anderson said. “Seniors, who are some or the most reliable poll workers find the full 12 days … in a row to be too demanding.”\nBut state Rep. , D-Houston, was critical of the effort.\n“Let’s get the elephant out of the room,” he told Anderson, adding that in 2008 the majority of Hispanics and Latinos voted for President Obama. “Let’s get down to what this is really about. It’s about suppression.”\nOthers...[Content truncated]",

You’ll find candidate profiles that include detailed, issue-based questionnaires; video interviews that allow you to hear directly from candidates about where they stand on the big topics; and an easy-to-navigate compilation of legal bar association ratings for the sometimes difficult-to-navigate judicial races.\nOur  is the place to go for information on how to vote early, where to vote and all the things you need to know about Election Day. We also pulled together the latest election and political coverage from our WTTW News team. The guide is presented, in part, with support from the League of Women Voters of Cook County.\n### Key Dates\nElection Day\n**March 19, 2024**\nMail-In Ballots Postmarked\n**March 19, 2024**\nEarly Voting Begins (Depending on Location)\n**February 8 - March 4, 2024**\n### Search Candidates\nSearch\nOR \n2024 Races\n----------\n2024 Ballot Measures\n--------------------\n**Stay up to date.**\nFor the best election news coverage daily, sign up for the WTTW News Daily Briefing.\nSubmit\n!\nLatest Coverage\n---------------\n] \n] \n] \n] \n] \n] \nThanks to our sponsors:\nThanks to our sponsors:\n-----------------------\n---------------------------------------------------\nThanks to our sponsors:\n-----------------------\n---------------------------------------------------\nThanks to our sponsors:\n-----------------------\n---------------------------------------------------\n#### Top Chicago news stories in your inbox",
