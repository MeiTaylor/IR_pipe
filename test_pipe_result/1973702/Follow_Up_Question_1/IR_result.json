(African American women did not gain the right to vote until passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, when all women obtained this right). But even with this constitutional right, many states prevented African Americans from enjoying the benefits of full citizenship through laws known as Jim Crow laws.\nTo prevent African Americans from voting, many states enacted legislation that erected barriers to voting — such as literacy tests, moral character tests, property ownership requirements, and poll taxes.\nAlthough many of these laws were \"colorblind\" on their face, they were designed specifically to exclude African American citizens by allowing white election officials to apply the procedures selectively.\n...[Content truncated]",

The League will continue our fight to ensure all voters, especially those that have been traditionally underrepresented or underserved, have the opportunity and the information to exercise their right to vote.”\n“In 2020, we saw record voter turnout, especially among voters of color and young people, because of the work of these leading organizations. Now, a small group of elected officials fixated on maintaining their waning political power have purposely put up barriers to make it harder for some Americans to vote, jeopardizing our democracy.

Since then, state lawmakers have proposed more than 500 anti-voter bills seeking to silence Black, brown, working class, and young voters, and voters with disabilities, which many of these organizations represent.\n“Our democracy is stronger when everyone can cast their vote to make their voice heard at the polls,\" said **Virginia Kase Solomón**, CEO of the League of Women Voters of the United States. \"Some politicians are attacking our freedom to vote and suppressing certain underserved populations from participating in our elections, including African Americans and Hispanic voters. This is why we support the passage of the _Freedom to Vote Act_ and the _John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act_, to ensure elections are free, fair, and accessible to all voters. The League will continue our fight to ensure all voters, especially those that have been traditionally underrepresented or underserved, have the opportunity and the information to exercise their right to vote.”\n“In 2020, we saw record voter turnout, especially among voters of color and young people, because of the work of these leading organizations. Now, a small group of elected officials fixated on maintaining their waning political power have purposely put up barriers to make it harder for some Americans to vote, jeopardizing our democracy. We will not back down. We are organizing and are preparing to fight day in and day out in 2022. And that fight starts with our collective effort to press Congress to do the right thing and pass critical voting rights legislation to protect voters and their access to the ballot box,” said **Stephanie L. Young**, Executive Director of When We All Vote.\nThe pledge also calls on corporations, the faith community, state-based voting rights organizations and nonprofit organizations to join When We All Vote, Mrs. Obama, and the signatories in pledging their own commitments to voting rights, voter registration, and voter turnout in 2022.   \nInitial signatories of the pledge include: ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge, Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote (APIAVote), Black Girls Vote, Common Cause, Deliver My Vote, Drag Out The Vote, Fair Fight Action, Faith in Public Life, Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, League of Women Voters, Mi Familia Vota, More Than A Vote, NAACP, NAACP Legal Defense Fund, National Action Network, National Bar Association Young Lawyers Division, National Urban League, National Women's Law Center, NextGen America, Protect the Sacred, RepresentUs,...[Content truncated]"

(African American women did not gain the right to vote until passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, when all women obtained this right). But even with this constitutional right, many states prevented African Americans from enjoying the benefits of full citizenship through laws known as Jim Crow laws.\nTo prevent African Americans from voting, many states enacted legislation that erected barriers to voting — such as literacy tests, moral character tests, property ownership requirements, and poll taxes.\nAlthough many of these laws were \"colorblind\" on their face, they were designed specifically to exclude African American citizens by allowing white election officials to apply the procedures selectively.\n...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What specific voting rights issues did the Obama Administration support regarding the NAACP and League of Women Voters?",
        "Answer": "The Obama Administration supported several specific voting rights issues in relation to the NAACP and the League of Women Voters, primarily focused on ensuring access to the ballot and combating voter suppression. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Restoration of Voting Rights for Formerly Incarcerated Individuals**: The Obama Administration advocated for the full restoration of voting rights for those who had completed their prison sentences. Heather Higginbottom from the Domestic Policy Council emphasized that once felons served their sentences, they should have their voting rights restored, aligning with the broader goals of organizations like the NAACP which seek to fight against disenfranchisement due to past convictions.\n\n2. **Combating Voter Suppression**: The Obama Administration, alongside the League of Women Voters, supported legislative initiatives like the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. These efforts were aimed at protecting voters from restrictive laws that disproportionately affected marginalized groups, such as African Americans and young voters. The League of Women Voters has publicly stated that they will continue to fight against proposed anti-voter bills and barriers that prevent certain populations from exercising their right to vote.\n\n3. **Defending Voting Rights Act**: The Administration also worked towards defending the principles of the Voting Rights Act, understanding its historical significance in protecting voter rights from discriminatory practices. President Obama himself highlighted the importance of ensuring that all Americans are able to vote without facing unnecessary barriers, reiterating that safeguarding the voting process is a shared responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, the Obama Administration took a firm stance on supporting voting rights issues that included restoring voting rights for previously incarcerated individuals, fighting against voter suppression laws, and upholding the Voting Rights Act to protect the voting access of marginalized communities.",
