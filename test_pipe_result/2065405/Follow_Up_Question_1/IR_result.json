But of course, that did not last.\n**John R. Price:** Absolutely. And you made a very important point — not central to my book or my career in politics or my arguments, which were focused on domestic and social policy — but the reason Eisenhower has often said that he finally decided to run for the presidency was because he had a private secret meeting with Robert Taft, senator of Ohio and a key leader in the Republicans in the Congress, Senate — he was the Republican leader specifically in the Senate. And Eisenhower asked him point blank… He said — NATO had just been formed in 1949 — and Eisenhower said to Taft, “Look, even Harry Truman has been asking me to run for president.” He said, “I wouldn’t run if I knew that you would embrace internationalism and embrace NATO specifically.” And Taft said, “In conscience, I can’t do that.” And that led to Eisenhower saying, “All right.” He didn’t say it to Taft at the time, but he made the decision to run against Taft for the nomination and for the presidency.\n**Geoff Kabaservice:** When the Ripon Society had come up with its name, it made a pilgrimage to that schoolhouse in Wisconsin.\n**John R. Price:** We did indeed. But there was a specific moment in time when that was done. And it was after the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party in 1964, Barry Morris Goldwater of Arizona, had voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act. And he had voted with, I think, four other Republican senators. 25 or 26 other Republicans, by a ratio of almost five to one, voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act. But Goldwater had opposed it, voting with Democrats like Strom Thurmond, who that autumn crossed the aisle to say he was a Republican.\nAnd so we felt, the folks in Ripon felt, that this was blasphemy, if you will, within the context of a party which for a hundred years had stood for civil rights, for the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments, for attempts...[Content truncated]",

When running for president, the rough-edged, charismatic Westerner overcame his party’s old guard by galvanizing a grassroots coalition of businesspeople, Southerners, Midwesterners and libertarians who felt sidelined by the GOP. \nIt was their values, not those of wealthy Eastern elites, that should prevail in the Republican platform, he argued as he rallied to defeat primary rivals like New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and the Boston Brahmin Henry Cabot Lodge. \"Sometimes I think this country would be better off if we could just saw off the Eastern Seaboard and let it float out to sea,” he famously told the press in the early 1960s. While Johnson was loudly declaring a War on Poverty, Goldwater waged war on the moderate wing of his own party.\nGoldwater warned in the acceptance speech that “any who do not care for our cause” didn’t belong within the GOP ranks.

Goldwater ran for president in 1964, Martin Luther King, Jr., expressed his opposition, explaining: “I feel that the prospect of Senator Goldwater being president of the United States so threatens the health, morality, and survival of our nation that I can not in good conscience fail to take a stand against what he represents” (King, 16 July 1964). Goldwater lost the election to President Lyndon  in a landslide, winning majorities only in his native Arizona and five states of the Deep South.\nBorn in Phoenix in 1909, when Arizona was still a territory, Goldwater’s family was part of the city’s elite. After completing high school at a military academy in Virginia, he enrolled in the University of Arizona at Tucson in 1928. When his father died the following year, Goldwater dropped out of college to manage his family’s department store. He joined the Air Force during World War II, flying missions from India and China. When he returned to Phoenix after the war, he was elected to the city council.\nIn 1952, Goldwater was elected to the Senate on a pledge to reduce federal spending and fight .

            "content": "By: Suzanne McGee\nUpdated: February 26, 2024  | Original: October 20, 2020\nWhen the far-right Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater ran for the American presidency in 1964, he never even pretended to woo voters in the political center. “Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice,” declared Goldwater in his speech accepting the Republican Party’s nomination at its 1964 convention. “And…moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.”\nThat fall, incumbent Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson crushed Goldwater in a historic landslide, carrying more than 60 percent of the vote. Goldwater won only his home state and five deep South states that had long leaned Democratic, but were struggling with the party’s actions supporting civil rights.\nGoldwater was, without doubt, a divisive figure: Democratic detractors like Martin Luther King. Jr. and then-California Governor Pat Brown had compared his blunt, pull-no-punches rhetoric to Hitler. Within his own party, moderates responded with varying degrees of dismay or horror to his policies. On the eve of the 1964 GOP convention, the Republican governor of Pennsylvania, William Scranton, publicly released a letter he had written to Goldwater decrying the latter’s “crazy quilt” of “dangerous positions,” including his casual attitude toward the use of nuclear weapons. \nBut while his own bid for the White House flamed out, the embers...[Content truncated]"

And Robert Taft was always its standard bearer. And Eisenhower really did convert the Republican Party to internationalism and seemingly the cause of moderation. But of course, that did not last.\n**John R. Price:** Absolutely. And you made a very important point — not central to my book or my career in politics or my arguments, which were focused on domestic and social policy — but the reason Eisenhower has often said that he finally decided to run for the presidency was because he had a private secret meeting with Robert Taft, senator of Ohio and a key leader in the Republicans in the Congress, Senate — he was the Republican leader specifically in the Senate. And Eisenhower asked him point blank… He said — NATO had just been formed in 1949 — and Eisenhower said to Taft, “Look, even Harry Truman has been asking me to run for president.” He said, “I wouldn’t run if I knew that you would embrace internationalism and embrace NATO specifically.” And Taft said, “In conscience, I can’t do that.” And that led to Eisenhower saying, “All right.” He didn’t say it to Taft at the time, but he made the decision to run against Taft for the nomination and for the presidency.\n**Geoff Kabaservice:** When the Ripon Society had come up with its name, it made a pilgrimage to that schoolhouse in Wisconsin.\n**John R. Price:** We did indeed. But there was a specific moment in time when that was done. And it was after the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party in 1964, Barry Morris Goldwater of Arizona, had voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act. And he had voted with, I think, four other Republican senators. 25 or 26 other Republicans, by a ratio of almost five to one, voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act. But Goldwater had opposed it, voting with Democrats like Strom Thurmond, who that autumn crossed the aisle to say he was a Republican.\nAnd so we felt, the folks in Ripon felt, that this was blasphemy, if you will, within the context of a party which for a hundred years had stood for civil rights, for the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments, for attempts...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What specific concerns did traditional Republicans have about Goldwater's candidacy in the 1964 election?",
        "Answer": "Traditional Republicans had several specific concerns about Barry Goldwater's candidacy in the 1964 election:\n\n1. **Concerns About Extremism**: Many traditional Republicans were worried that Goldwater’s rhetoric and policy positions were too extreme for the general electorate. His famous declaration, “Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice,” raised alarms among moderates within the party who feared that this kind of thinking would alienate centrist voters and could potentially lead to a disastrous election outcome. The apprehension was that Goldwater's uncompromising style could be equated to extremism that was troubling for the Republican image.\n\n2. **Opposition to Civil Rights Legislation**: Goldwater's decision to vote against the 1964 Civil Rights Act was particularly controversial. This position alienated numerous traditional Republicans who, for many years, viewed their party as a proponent of civil rights. His opposition was seen as a betrayal of the party's historic commitments to civil rights, especially during a time when the country was grappling with issues of racial equality and unrest. This divergence from the mainstream Republican stance caused significant unease among party moderates and those who valued civil rights.\n\n3. **Alignment with Extremist Groups**: There was a fear that Goldwater’s candidacy attracted endorsements from radical and extremist groups, which could tarnish the Republican brand. Traditional Republicans expressed concern that such associations would reinforce stereotypes and fears among the electorate, particularly regarding the Ku Klux Klan—groups that openly supported Goldwater were seen as misalignments to the party’s values and image.\n\n4. **Fear of Electoral Viability**: There was a palpable concern over Goldwater’s viability as a candidate in the general election. Traditional Republicans feared that his policies and campaign style would resonate poorly with a broader voter base that was more moderate. This fear was expressed in the context of his loss in the election, where he secured only a small fraction of the vote, indicating that many Republicans were right to be worried about divisiveness within the party leading to electoral failure.",
