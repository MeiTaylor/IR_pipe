Today we call it, \"A Time for Choosing,\" and it was a pivotal turning point in Ronald Reagan's life. \nRonald Reagan began a long side-career of public speaking as his acting career closed out.  He traveled across the country meeting Lions Clubs, Rotary Clubs, Chambers of Commerce and any other civic-minded local groups.  This continued and intensified during his service as the General Electric spokesperson while hosting their sponsored television series.  \"The Speech\" was delivered in various forms and to different audiences as each word was honed, measured and memorized. \nDuring the 1964 Presidential campaign, Republican party officials in California, who knew Reagan's powerful message and delivery, asked him to film a speech on behalf of the Republican candidate, Barry Goldwater.   The speech was aired on October 27, 1964 and it was electrifying. Donations to the Republican party and candidates increased dramatically. \nThe Republican Party took note and they targeted Reagan as a candidate from that point forward. He agreed in 1966 to run for Governor of California. He won two terms, and eventually won the Presidency. \nYou may watch the speech on our YouTube channel.\nTranscript of \"A Time for Choosing,\" delivered on national television on October 27, 1964\nThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you and good evening. The sponsor has been identified, but unlike most television programs, the performer hasn't been provided with a script. As a matter of fact, I have been permitted to choose my own words and discuss my own ideas regarding the choice that we face in the next few weeks.I have spent most of my life as a Democrat. I recently have seen fit to follow another course. I believe that the issues confronting us cross party lines. Now, one side in this campaign has been telling us that the issues of this election are the maintenance of peace and prosperity. The line has been used, \"We've never had it so good.\"But I have an uncomfortable...[Content truncated]",

Lyndon B. Johnson defeated Republican Barry Goldwater in one of the largest landslides in U.S. history.\nThe 1964 election occurred just less than one year after the assassination of Pres. John F. Kennedy in Dallas. Johnson, Kennedy\u2019s vice president, was quickly sworn in, and in the subsequent days Kennedy\u2019s presumed assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, was murdered. To American and foreign observers alike, this created a disturbing image of disorder and violence in the United States. In the tempestuous days after the assassination, Johnson helped to calm national hysteria and ensure continuity in the presidency. On November 27 he addressed a joint session of Congress and, invoking the memory of the martyred president, urged the passage of Kennedy\u2019s legislative agenda, which had been stalled in congressional committees. Johnson placed greatest importance on Kennedy\u2019s civil rights bill, which became the focus of his efforts during the first months of his presidency.\nCentral to the 1964 campaign was race relations, particularly with the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, which Johnson signed into law in July and which was intended to end discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin. For most of the period since the end of the American Civil War in 1865, the Democratic Party dominated what came to be known...[Content truncated]",

Johnson, July 24, 1964()\nIt was the summer of 1964, and Lyndon Johnson was scared. Having just achieved one of the greatest congressional victories in history by passing the Civil Rights Act (CRA) over the strident objections of his native South, Johnson was now confronted by black riots in several urban centers. He feared that his Republican opponent, Barry Goldwater, would exploit the racial turmoil by appealing to the white backlash. The riots were even labeled \"Goldwater rallies\" since the conflagrations helped the GOP so directly. Would racial politics cost LBJ the White House?\nBoth Johnson and Goldwater would face several tests of their character in the long election season of 1964, tests involving the CRA, urban riots, the George Wallace candidacy, and the white backlash.

Goldwater, of course, was defeated resoundingly on Election Day, winning only six states. \"It was the judgment of the establishment that Goldwater's critique of American liberalism had been given its final exposure on the national political scene,\" Buckley continued. \"But then of course 16 years later the world was made to stand on its head when Ronald Reagan was swept into office on a platform indistinguishable from what Barry had been preaching.\"\nStrange, then, that these days many commentators believe that Goldwater's conservatism was a different species from Reagan's and, especially, from George W.

When the 2004 Republican national convention showcased social liberals like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Rudy Giuliani, George F.

He has wrecked his party for a long time to come and is not even likely to control the wreckage.\nIt is not only that he ran behind President Johnson by a larger popular majority than any other loser in the history of presidential elections, but he ran so far behindtheveryprogressiveshe scorned in his own party that he now faces a G.O.P. revolt against his leadership and associates in the Republican national and state organizations.\nThe only theory he proved is that part of the Deep South, particularly the rural South, favors his policies of leaving the Negro revolution to the judgment of the States. His gamble that the North would put its prejudices against the Negro ahead of its conscience was disproved. His belief that the American people would turn against the principles of social security at home and collective security abroad was rejected. Even the Middle Western Bible Belt on which he centered his moral yearnings, turned against him.\nThe American people followed the historic voting pattern of the nation in yesterday's 45th presidential election. In a time of comparative peace and prosperity, they voted once more for continuity rather than for radical change. They voted, as usual, for the incumbent President rather than for his opponent....[Content truncated]",

Goldwater, 89, a five-term U.S. senator from Arizona and a champion of conservatism whose 1964 presidential candidacy launched a revolution within the Republican Party, died yesterday at home in Paradise Valley, a suburb of Phoenix.\nHe suffered a stroke in 1996 that damaged the part of the brain that controls memory and personality. Last September, family members said he was in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.\nMr. Goldwater, who retired from the Senate in 1986 as one of his party's most respected elder statesmen, suffered a resounding defeat when he ran for president. But his efforts helped prepare the way for the election of another conservative Republican, Ronald Reagan, as president in 1980.\nMr. Goldwater carried only six states and 36 percent of the popular vote in 1964. After the election, most analysts and commentators concluded that the Republican Party was hopelessly divided, and that Mr. Goldwater and his conservative philosophy were all but politically dead.\n\n\n\nFrom collection of Ken Rudin\n\n\nIn fact, he had wrested control of the GOP from the Eastern liberal wing that had dominated it for years. By 1980, he was acknowledged as the founder of a conservative movement that had become a vital element in mainstream Republican thinking and a major ingredient in Reagan's political ascendancy.
