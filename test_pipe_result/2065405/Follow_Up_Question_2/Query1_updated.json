Today we call it, \"A Time for Choosing,\" and it was a pivotal turning point in Ronald Reagan's life. \nRonald Reagan began a long side-career of public speaking as his acting career closed out.  He traveled across the country meeting Lions Clubs, Rotary Clubs, Chambers of Commerce and any other civic-minded local groups.  This continued and intensified during his service as the General Electric spokesperson while hosting their sponsored television series.  \"The Speech\" was delivered in various forms and to different audiences as each word was honed, measured and memorized. \nDuring the 1964 Presidential campaign, Republican party officials in California, who knew Reagan's powerful message and delivery, asked him to film a speech on behalf of the Republican candidate, Barry Goldwater.   The speech was aired on October 27, 1964 and it was electrifying. Donations to the Republican party and candidates increased dramatically. \nThe Republican Party took note and they targeted Reagan as a candidate from that point forward. He agreed in 1966 to run for Governor of California. He won two terms, and eventually won the Presidency. \nYou may watch the speech on our YouTube channel.\nTranscript of \"A Time for Choosing,\" delivered on national television on October 27, 1964\nThank you.

As a matter of fact, I have been permitted to choose my own words and discuss my own ideas regarding the choice that we face in the next few weeks.I have spent most of my life as a Democrat. I recently have seen fit to follow another course. I believe that the issues confronting us cross party lines.

You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox.\nThe 1964 political ad that I describe in my column this morning \u2014 the ad that reminds me of my grandparents \u2014 has had a fascinating second life in 2016.\nIt\u2019s a spartan, four-minute ad that depicts a lifelong Republican talking about his agony over his party\u2019s decision to nominate Barry Goldwater. Although the man was an actor, he was indeed a Republican unwilling to vote for Goldwater. Referring to the Goldwater supporters, he said, \u201cEither they\u2019re not Republicans, or I\u2019m not.\u201d\nFor obvious reasons, the ad \u2014 called \u201cConfessions of a Republican\u201d \u2014 began attracting online attention from conservatives early this year. Quartz ran a story about it on March 9, and Rachel Maddow aired it on her MSNBC show the same night. She then gleefully interviewed the actor from the ad \u2014 William Bogert, now 80 years old \u2014 in May, and he was just as charming as you might hope.\nHe is also as opposed to Donald Trump as he was to Goldwater, maybe more so. Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign even re-made the 1964 ad, with Bogert playing the same role (though I prefer the longer, original version). He turns out to be a nice encapsulation of the Republican Party\u2019s struggles with white professionals, a group that it once dominated. Trump has obviously aggravated those struggles.\nMy column this morning tells you some more about my late grandparents (whom, if it\u2019s not obvious, I completely adored) and why I think they\u2019re relevant to the agonizing choice facing Republicans this year.\nYou can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook. I am also writing a daily email newsletter until the election and invite you to subscribe.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter. \nAdvertisement",

The riots were even labeled \"Goldwater rallies\" since the conflagrations helped the GOP so directly. Would racial politics cost LBJ the White House?\nBoth Johnson and Goldwater would face several tests of their character in the long election season of 1964, tests involving the CRA, urban riots, the George Wallace candidacy, and the white backlash. The election of 1964 is considered by many to be the most racially polarized presidential contest in modern American history. As such, it has been seen as a watershed in the evolution of our two-party system in recent times. Yet what has been missed in previous analyses of 1964 is how assiduously both Goldwater and Johnson worked to take race off the agenda. Johnson believed that if the election became a referendum on civil rights, he might lose. Goldwater believed that history would judge him harshly if his campaign blatantly exploited the racial hatred of whites.\nStill, despite these efforts, the racial implications of the 1964 campaign would linger for decades. The first Southerner to occupy the White House for more than a hundred years lost the heart of his region, signaling the dawn of an era of Republican dominance of the South in presidential politics. The first man of Jewish descent to run on a major ticket  would lead the Republican Party into a monochromatic whiteness from which it has not yet recovered. After 1964, Democrats could take the black vote for granted as the GOP became the party through which whites expressed their unease over black progress. The contest between Johnson and Goldwater shaped American racial politics for the next thirty-six years.\n**The Setting: 1964 as Johnson's \"Given Moment\"**\nAs the 1964 election season opened, the contrast with the same period in 1960 could not have been more stark. The 1960 election between Nixon and Kennedy had pitted two advocates of civil rights against each other, but the issue was far from central to American politics. In 1964, race was the dominant issue in domestic politics, as it had not been since Reconstruction. The heightened prominence given to civil rights in 1964 was produced by three key factors. First, the direct action tactics of the newly invigorated civil rights movement had, since 1960, focused the attention of the nation on the problems of Jim Crow. President Kennedy also helped put race at the center of American politics. The favorite candidate of many segregationists in 1960 had gradually become the greatest presidential rhetorician on race since Lincoln. After two years...[Content truncated]",

I never for a moment feared Communism in the US but have always feared Fascism; it\u2019s a real American trait.\u201d\nThat year\u2019s GOP nominee, Barry Goldwater, did a delicate dance, as many Republicans do today, trying to distance himself from the extremists without alienating them. Voters weren\u2019t having it. Lyndon B. Johnson defeated Goldwater, as Gellhorn had hoped, in one of the biggest landslides in U.S. history.\nNo such purgative outcome appears possible in today\u2019s closely divided country, however. In 2012, amid the rise of the tea party, President Barack Obama promised that if he were reelected, it would \u201cbreak the fever\u201d of political dysfunction that had overtaken Washington.\nObama won, but the virus had taken hold. And in 2015, a new variant emerged off an escalator in Trump Tower.\nIf Americans, knowing everything they now know about him, reelect Trump \u2014 or come close to doing so \u2014 it will be time for us all to quit lying to ourselves.\nThis is who we are.",

The Republican Party had stuck closely with Nixon even through the darkest days of the Watergate scandal; even as its lawmakers whispered behind closed doors about his guilt and even as public opinion polls showed Nixon dragging down their party, they had toughed it out\u2014past the indictments of his top aides, past the courts batting back one attempt at obstruction after another, even after Nixon\u2019s attacks on and ultimate firing of the special prosecutor targeting him.\nIt wasn\u2019t until August 6, 1974, at the regular Senate Republican Conference lunch that Barry Goldwater fumed to his colleagues: \u201cThere are only so many lies you can take, and now there has been one too many. Nixon should get his ass out of the White House\u2014today!\u201d\nHours later, he ventured to the White House to tell Nixon to resign.\nAnd, amazingly, Nixon did. For Nixon knew that when Goldwater threw in the towel, it really was over.\nExamining this critical turning point in Nixon\u2019s presidency and the arc of the larger Watergate scandal carries with it today important lessons about the impeachment trial President Donald Trump is now undergoing. It also raises the all-important question of whether there\u2019s a Barry Goldwater moment ahead in Trump\u2019s future. Is there even a figure in the GOP left today to carry such a message to a White House under siege? Is there even a figure in the GOP whom Trump respects enough to listen to?\nGoldwater arrived at the White House with sufficient gravitas, along with the minority leaders of the House and Senate, two other top Republicans, to convince Nixon it was over.\nGoldwater\u2019s journey carried such weight because, of course, the former standard-bearer of the GOP was no RINO. As the presidential nominee for his party in 1964, his bellicose rhetoric at the height of the Cold War had led Lyndon Johnson to run one of the most devastating and famous political ads of all time against him\u2014the famed \u201cDaisy\u201d ad, which juxtaposed a young girl counting petals in a field of flowers with the ominous voice of a nuclear launch countdown before the...[Content truncated]",

But was the GOP\u2019s complete surrender to Trumpism an aberration? Or was the party long sliding toward this point?

But the inclination of so many Republican voters to dismiss all of the charges accumulating against Trump also reflects something much more fundamental: the hardening tendency of conservatives to believe that they are the real victims of bias in a society irreversibly growing more racially and culturally diverse. \n    \n\n            From the outset of Trump\u2019s political career, he has channeled that sentiment into his seemingly unbreakable bond with his core supporters. Now, Trump has transformed his multiple indictments \u2013 particularly from Black prosecutors he has repeatedly called \u201cracist\u201d \u2013 into just the latest proof point for the widespread belief within the GOP base that the biggest victims of discrimination are the groups most of them belong to: Christians, men and Whites.\n    \n\n             \u201cVictimhood is embedded in every part of Trump\u2019s campaign, personality, communications, and strategy,\u201d says Tresa Undem, a pollster for progressive causes. \u201cThe only thing that shifts is the topic and the object of blame.\u201d \n...[Content truncated]",
