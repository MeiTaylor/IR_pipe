In fact, those of which I am aware are total nonsense. Not only are the candidates dramatically different personality types, but so too are the circumstances today versus the middle of the last century.\nYesterday I listened as a couple of know-it-all conservative radio commentators comparing Trump\u2019s outspokenness with Goldwater\u2019s. \u201cTrump isn\u2019t doing anything that Goldwater did not do in his day, and today Goldwater is revered,\u201d one of them declared. For this reason, they were sure if Trump did not win, he too would one day be similarly respected for his outspoken personal and political candor. Because of the differences between these men I am sure they are wrong.\nWhile it is hard not to be aware of Trump\u2019s bloviating, clearly, these guys did not know what they are talking about regarding Goldwater. Not only is there no similarity between the kind of statements Goldwater made in 1964 and those Trump is making today, but even more striking are the different treatments given the statements made by these men. Let\u2019s turn back the clock and take a look.\nGoldwater\u2019s 1964 Political Rhetoric\n-----------------------------------\nWhile always self-confident and self-assured, Goldwater was also self-effacing and candid to a fault. Take his interview with seasoned political reporter Stewart Alsop for _The Saturday Evening Post_ (August 31, 1963) entitled \u201cCan Goldwater Win in 64?\u201d Here the senator was being very much himself, as he piloted the reporter around Arizona in his small two-engine airplane. A brief\u00a0sample of Goldwater\u2019s statements from Alsop\u2019s article provide a pretty good sense of the man and the nature of his outspokenness:\n> On the possibility that he might actually wake up to be president one day: \u201cFrankly, it scares the hell out of me.\u201d\n> \n> On his own intelligence...[Content truncated]",

The speech was aired on October 27, 1964 and it was electrifying. Donations to the Republican party and candidates increased dramatically. \nThe Republican Party took note and they targeted Reagan as a candidate from that point forward. He agreed in 1966 to run for Governor of California. He won two terms, and eventually won the Presidency. \nYou may watch the speech on our YouTube channel.\nTranscript of \"A Time for Choosing,\" delivered on national television on October 27, 1964\nThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you and good evening. The sponsor has been identified, but unlike most television programs, the performer hasn't been provided with a script. As a matter of fact, I have been permitted to choose my own words and discuss my own ideas regarding the choice that we face in the next few weeks.I have spent most of my life as a Democrat. I recently have seen fit to follow another course. I believe that the issues confronting us cross party lines. Now, one side in this campaign has been telling us that the issues of this election are the maintenance of peace and prosperity. The line has been used, \"We've never had it so good.\"But I have an uncomfortable feeling that this prosperity isn't something on which we can base our hopes for the future. No nation in history has ever survived a tax burden that reached a third of its national income. Today, 37 cents out of every dollar earned in this country is the tax collector's share, and yet our government continues to spend 17 million dollars a day more than the government takes in. We haven't balanced our budget 28 out of the last 34 years. We've raised our debt limit three times in the last twelve months, and now our national debt is one and a half times bigger than all the combined debts of all the nations of the world. We have 15 billion dollars in gold in our treasury; we don't own an ounce. Foreign dollar claims are 27.3 billion dollars. And we've just had announced that the dollar of 1939 will now purchase 45 cents in its total value.As for the peace that we would preserve, I wonder who among us would like to approach the wife or...[Content truncated]",

Like Trump, Goldwater drove the Republican establishment to distraction. Like Trump, the establishment woke up late to just how serious a threat Goldwater was to them. Like Trump, there were early indications that Goldwater at the head of the Republican ticket would result in a party wide disaster. And it did. Goldwater lost all but 6 states in 1964 and handed the Democrats outsized margins in Congress. (For perspective, Democrats held 67.8% of House seats and 68 Senate seats, after the 1964 race.)\nBut there is one big difference between Goldwater\u2019s 1964 campaign and Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. Goldwater took over the Republican Party from the bottom up. And Trump is trying to take it over from the top down. That way may not work as well.\nMore than six years before the 1964 Republican convention, Goldwater and his allies began cultivating the loyalties of the precinct committeemen and county chairman who would choose the national convention delegates. In contrast to today\u2019s highly visible process of electing delegates in primaries and open caucuses, Goldwater\u2019s chief strategist, Cliff White, pursued a nearly invisible nomination strategy aimed at the low and mid-level party elites who would eventually control the delegate selection process. This process largely escaped the scrutiny of the press, and what was observed was anecdotal and sketchy at best. In retrospect, Theodore White, the renowned chronicler of presidential elections was to write:\n> \u201cAll over the country, in the spring and summer months, such precinct, county and state conventions gathered without national notice\u2026 Like the Kerensky government, they \\ were unaware of revolution until the Red Guards were already ringing the Winter Palace.\u201d\nThis silent grassroots takeover of the Republican Party meant that in early May 1964, _Newsweek_ magazine concluded that Goldwater had the delegates he needed to wrap up the nomination even though he was sliding badly in the polls and continuing to lose primaries. Although moderate Republicans tried to unite at the convention to block Goldwater, he prevailed in a bitterly divided Republican convention. Although he lost big in November, Goldwater left his stamp on the Republican Party\u2014moving it significantly to the right and laying the ground for Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1980 nomination.\nDespite the similarities, there are big differences between Goldwater 1964 and Trump 2016. As state Republican parties begin the process of selecting delegates to the convention, it looks like Trump has few friends at the grassroots level of the Republican Party. Take the case of Colorado, _._ In a move that could well be a harbinger of future nomination races in both parties, the Colorado Republican...[Content truncated]",

And we do. Not a cult. But a strong Republican Party.\u201d Her comments echoed a sentiment that Joe Biden had expressed during the 2020 campaign: If Donald Trump were out of the White House, the GOP would return to normal and be amenable to forging deals and legislative compromises.\nBoth Pelosi and Biden have bolstered the notion that the current GOP, with its cultlike embrace of Trump and his Big Lie, and its acceptance of the fringiest players, is a break from the past. But was the GOP\u2019s complete surrender to Trumpism an aberration? Or was the party long sliding toward this point? About a year ago, I set out to explore the history of the Republican Party, with this question in mind. What I found was not an exception, but a pattern. Since the 1950s, the GOP has repeatedly mined fear, resentment, prejudice, and grievance and played to extremist forces so the party could win elections. Trump assembling white supremacists, neo-Nazis, Christian nationalists, QAnoners, and others who formed a violent terrorist mob on January 6 is only the most flagrant manifestation of the tried-and-true GOP tactic to court kooks and bigots. It\u2019s an ugly and shameful history that has led the Party of Lincoln, founded in 1854 to oppose the extension of slavery, to the Party of Trump, which capitalizes on racism and assaults democracy.\nIn my book _American Psychosis: A Historical Investigation of How the Republican Party Went Crazy_, I lay out this sordid history in great detail. But even a highlight reel makes it clear that the GOP has bowed to, depended on, and promoted far-right extremists and conspiracists for the past 70 years. Trumpism is the continuation, not a new version, of Republican politics.\nDwight D. Eisenhower surrendered to Joe McCarthy on a train.\nIn October 1952, Ike, the heroic World War II general who nabbed the GOP presidential nomination running as a moderate, was campaigning in Wisconsin with the nation\u2019s No. 1 Red-baiter.

The pattern had started much earlier. Our study of the 2016 presidential campaign found that Trump was the most heavily covered candidate in the national press during every month \u2013 and nearly every week \u2013 of the 2016 presidential campaign.11Thomas E.

Black people, she developed a seminal work, the \u201cTheory of Color-Confrontation.\u201d Her theory states that \u201cthe white or color-deficient Europeans responded psychologically with a profound sense of numerical inadequacy and color inferiority upon their confrontations with the massive majority of the world\u2019s people all of whom possessed varying degrees of color producing capacity\u201d (Cress-Wellsing, , p. 34). Because of this insecurity, what ensued, on the part of Europeans, were sordid and sociopathic oppressive ways of interacting with those who were not White. Africans were enslaved and forcibly brought to America for the express intention of building and supporting the US economy. Since its inception, racism has been embedded in the American culture. Race is a distinct concept from racism but the two are related. A key element of racism is it is based on perceptions \u2014 both real and imagined differences among groups of people. Furthermore, those differences assign values that benefit one group at the expense of other groups (Bell, ). And power is distributed based on those real and perceived differences, creating structural inequity that benefits the perceived superior group and disadvantages the subordinate groups (Bobo, ). In this paper, the authors contend that racism is entrenched in all spheres of American society, is a historical aspect of the US presidency, and that it has been and is systematically manifested in various ways through executive policies and practices. Because of the outlandish, inordinate number of racist remarks that were directed at African Americans by former President Trump during his four years in office, one could easily believe\u00a0that his contempt for Black people is not representative of past presidents. The authors will show that this is not the case by making comparisons between his racist acts and those of other presidents, beginning with George Washington.\nAn examination of the historical context will help readers understand the socio-political climate in which we presently live, in relation to past and present relationships between Whites and Blacks in the USA. We begin with a discussion of US scholars who examined the presidency through a racial lens. Next, we undertake a historical analysis of US presidents within this framework. Lastly, we hope that the implications discussed, relative to the lived experiences of African Americans, will help those in the human services and the political arena advocate for positive change in the life circumstances of Black people through the development of effective clinical practices and policy formation.\nCritical Race Theory\n--------------------\nAccording to Walton and Smith, \u201cRace is the most important cleavage in American life, with enormous impact on the nation\u2019s society, culture, and politics\u201d (Walton et al., ). Since Donald Trump first announced he\u00a0was running for president of the USA in 2015, it was clear he would use racism...[Content truncated]",
