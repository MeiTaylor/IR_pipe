You can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox.\nThe 1964 political ad that I describe in my column this morning — the ad that reminds me of my grandparents — has had a fascinating second life in 2016.\nIt’s a spartan, four-minute ad that depicts a lifelong Republican talking about his agony over his party’s decision to nominate Barry Goldwater. Although the man was an actor, he was indeed a Republican unwilling to vote for Goldwater. Referring to the Goldwater supporters, he said, “Either they’re not Republicans, or I’m not.”\nFor obvious reasons, the ad — called “Confessions of a Republican” — began attracting online attention from conservatives early this year. Quartz ran a story about it on March 9, and Rachel Maddow aired it on her MSNBC show the same night. She then gleefully interviewed the actor from the ad — William Bogert, now 80 years old — in May, and he was just as charming as you might hope.\nHe is also as opposed to Donald Trump as he was to Goldwater, maybe more so. Hillary Clinton’s campaign even re-made the 1964 ad, with Bogert playing the same role (though I prefer the longer, original version). He turns out to be a nice encapsulation of the Republican Party’s struggles with white professionals, a group that it once dominated. Trump has obviously aggravated those struggles.\nMy column this morning tells you some more about my late grandparents (whom, if it’s not obvious, I completely adored) and why I think they’re relevant to the agonizing choice facing Republicans this year.\nYou can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook.

I never for a moment feared Communism in the US but have always feared Fascism; it’s a real American trait.”\nThat year’s GOP nominee, Barry Goldwater, did a delicate dance, as many Republicans do today, trying to distance himself from the extremists without alienating them. Voters weren’t having it. Lyndon B. Johnson defeated Goldwater, as Gellhorn had hoped, in one of the biggest landslides in U.S. history.\nNo such purgative outcome appears possible in today’s closely divided country, however. In 2012, amid the rise of the tea party, President Barack Obama promised that if he were reelected, it would “break the fever” of political dysfunction that had overtaken Washington.\nObama won, but the virus had taken hold.

But the inclination of so many Republican voters to dismiss all of the charges accumulating against Trump also reflects something much more fundamental: the hardening tendency of conservatives to believe that they are the real victims of bias in a society irreversibly growing more racially and culturally diverse. \n    \n\n            From the outset of Trump’s political career, he has channeled that sentiment into his seemingly unbreakable bond with his core supporters. Now, Trump has transformed his multiple indictments – particularly from Black prosecutors he has repeatedly called “racist” – into just the latest proof point for the widespread belief within the GOP base that the biggest victims of discrimination are the groups most of them belong to: Christians, men and Whites.\n    \n\n             “Victimhood is embedded in every part of Trump’s campaign, personality, communications, and strategy,” says Tresa Undem, a pollster for progressive causes. “The only thing that shifts is the topic and the object of blame.” \n...[Content truncated]",

Like Trump, Goldwater drove the Republican establishment to distraction. Like Trump, the establishment woke up late to just how serious a threat Goldwater was to them. Like Trump, there were early indications that Goldwater at the head of the Republican ticket would result in a party wide disaster. And it did. Goldwater lost all but 6 states in 1964 and handed the Democrats outsized margins in Congress. (For perspective, Democrats held 67.8% of House seats and 68 Senate seats, after the 1964 race.)\nBut there is one big difference between Goldwater’s 1964 campaign and Trump’s 2016 campaign. Goldwater took over the Republican Party from the bottom up. And Trump is trying to take it over from the top down. That way may not work as well.\nMore than six years before the 1964 Republican convention, Goldwater and his allies began cultivating the loyalties of the precinct committeemen and county chairman who would choose the national convention delegates. In contrast to today’s highly visible process of electing delegates in primaries and open caucuses, Goldwater’s chief strategist, Cliff White, pursued a nearly invisible nomination strategy aimed at the low and mid-level party elites who would eventually control the delegate selection process. This process largely escaped the scrutiny of the press, and what was observed was anecdotal and sketchy at best. In retrospect, Theodore White, the renowned chronicler of presidential elections was to write:\n> “All over the country, in the spring and summer months, such precinct, county and state conventions gathered without national notice… Like the Kerensky government, they \\ were unaware of revolution until the Red Guards were already ringing the Winter Palace.”\nThis silent grassroots takeover of the Republican Party meant that in early May 1964, _Newsweek_ magazine concluded that Goldwater had the delegates he needed to wrap up the nomination even though he was sliding badly in the polls and continuing to lose primaries. Although moderate Republicans tried to unite at the convention to block Goldwater, he prevailed in a bitterly divided Republican convention. Although he lost big in November, Goldwater left his stamp on the Republican Party—moving it significantly to the right and laying the ground for Ronald Reagan’s 1980 nomination.\nDespite the similarities, there are big differences between Goldwater 1964 and Trump 2016. As state Republican parties begin the process of selecting delegates to the convention, it looks like Trump has few friends at the grassroots level of the Republican Party.

In fact, those of which I am aware are total nonsense. Not only are the candidates dramatically different personality types, but so too are the circumstances today versus the middle of the last century.\nYesterday I listened as a couple of know-it-all conservative radio commentators comparing Trump’s outspokenness with Goldwater’s. “Trump isn’t doing anything that Goldwater did not do in his day, and today Goldwater is revered,” one of them declared. For this reason, they were sure if Trump did not win, he too would one day be similarly respected for his outspoken personal and political candor. Because of the differences between these men I am sure they are wrong.\nWhile it is hard not to be aware of Trump’s bloviating, clearly, these guys did not know what they are talking about regarding Goldwater. Not only is there no similarity between the kind of statements Goldwater made in 1964 and those Trump is making today, but even more striking are the different treatments given the statements made by these men. Let’s turn back the clock and take a look.\nGoldwater’s 1964 Political Rhetoric\n-----------------------------------\nWhile always self-confident and self-assured, Goldwater was also self-effacing and candid to a fault. Take his interview with seasoned political reporter Stewart Alsop for _The Saturday Evening Post_ (August 31, 1963) entitled “Can Goldwater Win in 64?” Here the senator was being very much himself, as he piloted the reporter around Arizona in his small two-engine airplane. A brief sample of Goldwater’s statements from Alsop’s article provide a pretty good sense of the man and the nature of his outspokenness:\n> On the possibility that he might actually wake up to be president one day: “Frankly, it scares the hell out of me.”\n> \n> On his own intelligence...[Content truncated]",

And we do. Not a cult. But a strong Republican Party.” Her comments echoed a sentiment that Joe Biden had expressed during the 2020 campaign: If Donald Trump were out of the White House, the GOP would return to normal and be amenable to forging deals and legislative compromises.\nBoth Pelosi and Biden have bolstered the notion that the current GOP, with its cultlike embrace of Trump and his Big Lie, and its acceptance of the fringiest players, is a break from the past. But was the GOP’s complete surrender to Trumpism an aberration? Or was the party long sliding toward this point? About a year ago, I set out to explore the history of the Republican Party, with this question in mind. What I found was not an exception, but a pattern. Since the 1950s, the GOP has repeatedly mined fear, resentment, prejudice, and grievance and played to extremist forces so the party could win elections. Trump assembling white supremacists, neo-Nazis, Christian nationalists, QAnoners, and others who formed a violent terrorist mob on January 6 is only the most flagrant manifestation of the tried-and-true GOP tactic to court kooks and bigots. It’s an ugly and shameful history that has led the Party of Lincoln, founded in 1854 to oppose the extension of slavery, to the Party of Trump, which capitalizes on racism and assaults democracy.\nIn my book _American Psychosis: A Historical Investigation of How the Republican Party Went Crazy_, I lay out this sordid history in great detail. But even a highlight reel makes it clear that the GOP has bowed to, depended on, and promoted far-right extremists and conspiracists for the past 70 years. Trumpism is the continuation, not a new version, of Republican politics.\nDwight D.

            "content": "[Content truncated]... comment about “poisoning the blood” makes them more likely to support Trump.\nAlso discouraging is the possibility that, with voters unenamored of the fact that their likely choice is between the previous president and the current one, they might not show up to the polls at all.\nElections should be — and often have been — clarifying.\nIn 1964, when the radical right John Birch Society was near the peak of its influence, renowned journalist Martha Gellhorn, who had launched her career covering the Spanish Civil War three decades earlier, wrote a friend: “Unless there’s a Johnson landslide, the country and world will know how many incipient and energetic home-grown Fascists we have. I never for a moment feared Communism in the US but have always feared Fascism; it’s a real American trait.”\nThat year’s GOP nominee, Barry Goldwater, did a delicate dance, as many Republicans do today, trying to distance himself from the extremists without alienating them. Voters weren’t having it. Lyndon B. Johnson defeated Goldwater, as Gellhorn had hoped, in one of the biggest landslides in U.S. history.\nNo such purgative outcome appears possible in today’s closely divided country, however. In 2012, amid the rise of the tea party, President Barack Obama promised that if he were reelected, it would “break the fever” of political dysfunction that had overtaken Washington.\nObama won, but the virus had taken hold. And in 2015, a new variant emerged off an escalator in Trump Tower.\nIf Americans, knowing everything they now know about him, reelect Trump — or come close to doing so — it will be time for us all to quit lying to ourselves.\nThis is who we are."

            "content": "\n            When the Republican presidential candidates gather for their first debate this week, the encounter is likely to center on the legal problems of the man all of them are chasing. \n    \n\n            Former President Donald Trump has solidified his lead in the GOP race by convincing most Republican voters to view his four criminal indictments as a politicized “witch hunt” aimed not only at him, but them. \n    \n\n            Trump’s success in selling that argument to GOP voters has some immediate causes, key among them the choice by all of his leading competitors in the race, as well as most prominent voices in conservative media, to echo rather than challenge his contention. But the inclination of so many Republican voters to dismiss all of the charges accumulating against Trump also reflects something much more fundamental: the hardening tendency of conservatives to believe that they are the real victims of bias in a society irreversibly growing more racially and culturally diverse. \n    \n\n            From the outset of Trump’s political career, he has channeled that sentiment into his seemingly unbreakable bond with his core supporters. Now, Trump has transformed his multiple indictments – particularly from Black prosecutors he has repeatedly called “racist” – into just the latest proof point for the widespread belief within the GOP base that the biggest victims of discrimination are the groups most of them belong to: Christians, men and Whites.\n    \n\n             “Victimhood is embedded in every part of Trump’s campaign, personality, communications, and strategy,” says Tresa Undem, a pollster for progressive causes. “The only thing that shifts is the topic and the object of blame.” \n...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What similarities exist between public reception of Goldwater in 1964 and Trump in 2016 among Republican voters?",
        "Answer": "The public reception of Barry Goldwater in 1964 and Donald Trump in 2016 among Republican voters shares several notable similarities:\n\n1. **Concerns About Extremism**: Both Goldwater and Trump were viewed by certain segments of the Republican electorate as embodying extremist views. Goldwater's candidacy was marked by fears that his rhetoric could alienate moderate voters, as noted in his declaration, “Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice,” which unsettled many traditional Republicans [Query 1_evidence 2]. Trump, similarly, faced criticism for his incendiary comments and policies, which some Republicans felt risked damaging the party's image. The discomfort with both candidates reflected deeper anxieties about the party's direction and electoral viability.\n\n2. **Polarization and Party Identity**: In both cases, there were profound concerns about what their candidacies signified for the identity of the Republican Party. Voters during Goldwater’s campaign expressed division over whether they could align with a candidate who attracted endorsements from extremist groups like the John Birch Society, leading to sentiment such as “Either they’re not Republicans, or I’m not” [Query 1_evidence 1]. In 2016, Trump’s candidacy similarly polarized the party, as many traditional conservatives grappled with his appeal to what they considered radical elements within the GOP. This led to similar feelings of disconnection from the evolving party identity.\n\n3. **Perceptions of Victimhood**: A critical aspect of both men’s appeal to their supporters was how they framed themselves against the backdrop of perceived societal unfairness. Trump channeled a strong narrative of victimhood among his base, casting his legal troubles and criticisms as part of a larger “witch hunt” against conservatives [Query 1_evidence 3]. This dynamic echoes the 1964 sentiments where voters felt that their party’s choices were compromised by rising extremism, presenting a scenario where both candidates were treated as scapegoats for broader societal changes that threatened their supporters’ values.\n\n4. **Rejecting Establishment Views**: Both candidates were seen as challenging the establishment factions within the Republican Party. Goldwater's nomination represented a shift towards a more conservative base that rejected moderate Republicanism, much to the chagrin of traditional party members. Trump similarly positioned himself against party elites and was embraced by a swath of voters who felt in tune with his populist rhetoric, further emphasizing a rejection of the status quo within the party [Query 1_evidence 3].",
