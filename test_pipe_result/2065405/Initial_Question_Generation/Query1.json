Americans across parties share many policy preferences. There is some overlap even on hot-button issues, such as abortion and guns, and more overlap on how to teach American history.1 It is important not to make too much of this overlap, however. For instance, a majority of Democrats as well as four in ten Republicans support banning high-capacity ammunition magazines and creating a federal database to track gun sales; nearly as many Republicans support banning assault-style weapons. But only 18 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaners feel gun violence is a major problem (versus 73 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaners). So despite the significant policy overlap, only one side is motivated to put the issue on the agenda.2 Democrats have moved to the left on racial issues and some social issues over the last decade, and Republicans have moved to the right on immigration under Joe Bidenâs administration, though there remains overlap on these issues as well.3 In some cases, Republicans appear to be slowly adopting more progressive views on some social issues, resulting in what looks like polarization but is perhaps better characterized as faster moves by the left.4\n    However, most partisans hold major misbeliefs about the other partyâs preferences that lead them to think there is far less shared policy belief. This perception gap is highest among progressive activists, followed closely by extreme conservatives: in other words, the people who are most involved in civic and political life hold the least accurate views of the other sideâs beliefs. Figure 1 shows the gap between what groups of Americans think the other side believes and what...[Content truncated]",

On ABC, anchor Harry Reasoner assured viewers the technical difficulties were ânot a conspiracy against Governor Carter or President Ford.â \nFor 27 minutes, as the nation watched and audio engineers scrambled, the two candidates appeared frozen in place as they stood stiffly in silence behind their podiums. âI suspect both of us would have liked to sit down and relax while the technicians were fixing the system,â Ford recounted to PBS newsman Jim Lehrer, âbut I think both of us were hesitant to make any gesture that might look like we werenât physically or mentally able to handle a problem like this.â\n5. A president was once a debate no-show.In 1980, President Carter believed three was a crowd and refused to participate in any debate that included both Republican nominee Ronald Reagan and independent candidate John Anderson, so the incumbent was missing when his two opponents took to the stage on September 21, 1980. \nAs the wrangling continued, the vice presidential debate and the second scheduled presidential debate were cancelled.

The 2016 numbers exceeded the previous debate audience record of 80.6 million set in 1980 when President Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan debated for the first and only time. The third-most watched presidential debate was the September 29, 2020 event between Joseph Biden and Donald Trump, drawing 73 million viewers.\n7. Broadcast networks havenât always considered the debates âmust-see TV.âThe fall campaign always clashes with two other popular American pastimesâbaseball and the new TV seasonâand politics, even the presidential debates, doesnât always win out for air time. In past years, contractual obligations have required networks to broadcast baseball playoff games instead of the debates. In 2000, many NBC stations aired baseball in place of two...[Content truncated]",

Lyndon B. Johnson defeated Republican Barry Goldwater in one of the largest landslides in U.S. history.\nThe 1964 election occurred just less than one year after the assassination of Pres. John F. Kennedy in Dallas. Johnson, Kennedyâs vice president, was quickly sworn in, and in the subsequent days Kennedyâs presumed assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, was murdered. To American and foreign observers alike, this created a disturbing image of disorder and violence in the United States. In the tempestuous days after the assassination, Johnson helped to calm national hysteria and ensure continuity in the presidency. On November 27 he addressed a joint session of Congress and, invoking the memory of the martyred president, urged the passage of Kennedyâs legislative agenda, which had been stalled in congressional committees. Johnson placed greatest importance on Kennedyâs civil rights bill, which became the focus of his efforts during the first months of his presidency.\nCentral to the 1964 campaign was race relations, particularly with the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, which Johnson signed into law in July and which was intended to end discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin.

Rick Perlstein, in his 2001 book, âBefore the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus,â summarizes the trimming strategy: âGoldwater would take the line that Robert Welch was a crazy extremist but that the Society itself was full of fine, upstanding citizens working hard and well for the cause of Americanism.â Throughout the 1964 race, Goldwater availed himself of Bircher money and manpower at the risk of being soldered, by his opponents, to the Birchersâ more addled views, the most notorious of these being Welchâs suggestion that Dwight Eisenhower had consciously acted as an agent of the international Communist conspiracy.\nThe association of Goldwater and the society helped to take both of them down. By 1968, Richard Nixon, a needle-threader extraordinaire, had captured the Presidency and cemented an identification with conservatism despite being loathed by the Birch leadership for a lack of true belief. Nixon had famously withheld his applause when Goldwater declared, at the 1964 Convention, that âextremism in the defense of liberty is no viceâ; two years before that, he had been badly bruised by the society during his failed run for the governorship of California. (Screeching Bircher resistance during the Republican primary had left him exhausted for the general election.) After Nixon reached the White House, the dignified, mainstream sufferings of the âsilent majority,â not the rants of the Birchers, became the engine of his feinting, flexible conservatism, which pivoted most audaciously with his decision to visit China in 1972.\nNo destination could have been more infuriating to the J.B.S., China being where its eponymous idol, a twenty-seven-year-old American missionary turned military intelligence officer, met his death at the hands of Mao Zedongâs Red Army, on August 25, 1945âbecoming, in Welchâs estimation, âthe first casualtyâ of the Cold War. Welch did not discover Birchâs story until 1953: in his brief book âThe Life of John Birch,â published the following year, he describes how âall alone, in a committee room of the Senate Office Building in Washington, I was reading the dry typewritten pages in an unpublished report of an almost forgotten congressional committee hearing....[Content truncated]",
