But in this, as in so many other matters, things have always been a bit different in the South. Its masses have always relished strong, vivid political rhetoric. They will travel long distances to hear it, and\u2014other things being equal, or even a little unequal\u2014will reward eloquence at the polls. Goldwater nowhere attempted to satisfy the Southern appetite for language. The lines he got from his writers were as flat as his delivery of them. Even when the substance was inflammatory, the form was soporific\u2014statistics on crime, discussions of previously unheard-of Supreme Court rulings and internal-security cases, arguments over the relative merits of defense contractors. But this rarely dampened the enthusiasm that the crowds had brought with them to the gatherings. The quality of this enthusiasm, one felt, was essentially non-political. These were not really _political_ rallies\u2014they were revels, they were pageants, they were celebrations. The aim of the revellers was not so much to advance a candidacy or a cause as to dramatize a mood, and the mood was a kind of joyful defiance, or defiant joy. By coming South, Barry Goldwater had made it possible for great numbers of unapologetic white supremacists to hold great carnivals of white supremacy. They were not troubled in the least over whether this would hurt the Republican Party in the rest of the country. They wanted to make\u2014for their own satisfaction, if for no one else\u2019s\u2014a display of the fact that they had found and were enjoying membership in one organization that was secure against integration, because it had made itself secure against Negro aspirations; as long as they could put on shows of this kind, no Negro would ever want in. By far the most memorable of the shows was staged in Cramton Bowl, in Montgomery, Alabama, on the second night of Goldwater\u2019s tour. Some unsung Alabama Republican impresario had hit upon an idea of breathtaking simplicity: to show the country the \u201clily-white\u201d character of Republicanism in Dixie by planting the bowl with a great field of white lilies\u2014living lilies, in perfect bloom and gorgeously arrayed. The night was soft; the stars and the moon were bright; the grass in the bowl was impossibly green, as if it were growing out of something far richer than dirt; the stadium lights did not destroy the colors and shadows of evening yet illuminated the turf so well that individual blades of grass could be seen.

Today we call it, \"A Time for Choosing,\" and it was a pivotal turning point in Ronald Reagan's life. \nRonald Reagan began a long side-career of public speaking as his acting career closed out.  He traveled across the country meeting Lions Clubs, Rotary Clubs, Chambers of Commerce and any other civic-minded local groups.  This continued and intensified during his service as the General Electric spokesperson while hosting their sponsored television series.  \"The Speech\" was delivered in various forms and to different audiences as each word was honed, measured and memorized. \nDuring the 1964 Presidential campaign, Republican party officials in California, who knew Reagan's powerful message and delivery, asked him to film a speech on behalf of the Republican candidate, Barry Goldwater.   The speech was aired on October 27, 1964 and it was electrifying. Donations to the Republican party and candidates increased dramatically. \nThe Republican Party took note and they targeted Reagan as a candidate from that point forward. He agreed in 1966 to run for Governor of California. He won two terms, and eventually won the Presidency. \nYou may watch the speech on our YouTube channel.\nTranscript of \"A Time for Choosing,\" delivered on national television on October 27, 1964\nThank you.

Lyndon B. Johnson defeated Republican Barry Goldwater in one of the largest landslides in U.S. history.\nThe 1964 election occurred just less than one year after the assassination of Pres. John F. Kennedy in Dallas. Johnson, Kennedy\u2019s vice president, was quickly sworn in, and in the subsequent days Kennedy\u2019s presumed assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, was murdered. To American and foreign observers alike, this created a disturbing image of disorder and violence in the United States. In the tempestuous days after the assassination, Johnson helped to calm national hysteria and ensure continuity in the presidency. On November 27 he addressed a joint session of Congress and, invoking the memory of the martyred president, urged the passage of Kennedy\u2019s legislative agenda, which had been stalled in congressional committees. Johnson placed greatest importance on Kennedy\u2019s civil rights bill, which became the focus of his efforts during the first months of his presidency.\nCentral to the 1964 campaign was race relations, particularly with the passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, which Johnson signed into law in July and which was intended to end discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin. For most of the period since the end of the American Civil War in 1865, the Democratic Party dominated what came to be known...[Content truncated]",

Now, one side in this campaign has been telling us that the issues of this election are the maintenance of peace and prosperity. The line has been used \"We've never had it so good.\"\nBut I have an uncomfortable feeling that this prosperity isn't something on which we can base our hopes for the future. No nation in history has ever survived a tax burden that reached a third of its national income. Today, 37 cents of every dollar earned in this country is the tax collector's share, and yet our government continues to spend $17 million a day more than the government takes in. We haven't balanced our budget 28 out of the last 34 years. We have raised our debt limit three times in the last twelve months, and now our national debt is one and a half times bigger than all the combined debts of all the nations in the world. We have $15 billion in gold in our treasury--we don't own an ounce. Foreign dollar claims are $27.3 billion, and we have just had announced that the dollar of 1939 will now purchase 45 cents in its total value.\nAs for the peace that we would preserve, I wonder who among us would like to approach the wife or mother whose husband or son has died in South Vietnam and ask them if they think this is a peace that should be maintained indefinitely.

Having just achieved one of the greatest congressional victories in history by passing the Civil Rights Act (CRA) over the strident objections of his native South, Johnson was now confronted by black riots in several urban centers. He feared that his Republican opponent, Barry Goldwater, would exploit the racial turmoil by appealing to the white backlash. The riots were even labeled \"Goldwater rallies\" since the conflagrations helped the GOP so directly. Would racial politics cost LBJ the White House?\nBoth Johnson and Goldwater would face several tests of their character in the long election season of 1964, tests involving the CRA, urban riots, the George Wallace candidacy, and the white backlash.

Johnson crushed Goldwater in a historic landslide, carrying more than 60 percent of the vote. Goldwater won only his home state and five deep South states that had long leaned Democratic, but were struggling with the party\u2019s actions supporting civil rights.\nGoldwater was, without doubt, a divisive figure: Democratic detractors like Martin Luther King. Jr.\u00a0and then-California Governor Pat Brown had compared his blunt, pull-no-punches rhetoric to Hitler. Within his own party, moderates responded with varying degrees of dismay or horror to his policies. On the eve of the 1964 GOP convention, the Republican governor of Pennsylvania, William Scranton, publicly released a letter he had written to Goldwater decrying the latter\u2019s \u201ccrazy quilt\u201d of \u201cdangerous positions,\u201d including his casual attitude toward the use of nuclear weapons. \nBut while his own bid for the White House flamed out, the embers...[Content truncated]",

He loved exploring its rugged landscape, often piloting his own plane and always carrying a camera. He considered a military career, but his father\u2019s poor health forced him into the family business, Goldwater\u2019s Department Store. By the late 1940s he turned his attention to politics, winning a seat on the Phoenix City Council in 1949. \nSoon, Goldwater was tackling bigger political challenges. In 1952 he defeated the popular incumbent senator Ernest McFarland, who happened to be the Senate\u2019s Democratic majority leader. As senator, Goldwater proposed a new\u2014some said radical\u2014political agenda. \"He preached the cause of modern conservatism,\" wrote one biographer, which emphasized \u201cindividualism, the sanctity of private property\u2026 anticommunism, and the dangers of centralized power.\u201d Before long, the freshman senator moved into the ranks of leadership, becoming chair of the Republican Campaign Committee in 1955.\nIn 1960, with publication of The Conscience of a Conservative, Barry Goldwater became the leader of a national movement. Written with speechwriter Brent Bozell, the book was a statement of Goldwater's political creed. In chapters that focused on issues such as civil rights, labor relations, and the welfare state, Goldwater called for the \u201cutmost vigilance and care...to keep political power within its proper bounds.\u201d The national media largely dismissed the book, but Goldwater\u2019s vision quickly gained an audience and the book became a best-seller. Today, it is considered a landmark in the development of modern conservatism. \nIn January 1964 Goldwater announced his candidacy for president, facing strong competition within his own party.

In other speeches given that same day, Goldwater discussed the First Amendment and crime in America .\nFriday, October 30, 1964, Hubert Humphrey, Portland, OR\n-------------------------------------------------------\nDuring his October visit to Oregon, Humphrey made stops in both Pendleton and Portland. His Pendleton speech (delivered from the\u00a0airport hangar) focused on:\n*   motivating\u00a0young voters -\u00a0\u201cBecause the truth is, myyoung {sic} Americans, the truth is that there is no free country on the earth, no free country of Democratic institutions that has a poorer voting record than the United States of America,\"\u00a0and\n*   appealing to the concerns of rural farmers -\u00a0\u201cI want to see our rural America have every opportunity of our metropolitan America. But I also want America, all of America, to appreciate what rural America is doing for America and for the world.\u201d\nFrom Pendleton, Humphrey flew to Portland, where his visit took a decidedly different tone. He delivered his speech not in an airport hanger, but in the very center of the city. The public and press welcomed Humphrey\u00a0at Portland International Airport. He was then escorted by motorcade to the Hilton ballroom, on Southwest Broadway, in the heart of downtown.\n### The Politics of Radicalism\nThe tone of Humphrey's Portland speech appealed to the less conservative voters. It was a blistering attack on Republican candidate Barry Goldwater, expressing frustration at party politics and the fighting between Democrats and Republicans: \u201c...We have faced a number of great crises in our history under Democratic and Republican presidents but we have never thought of them as Democratic crises or Republican crises. They have been American crises. The men who faced them and led the nation to overcome them, have not done so as party leaders, but as Presidents of the United States\u2026\u201d\nHumphrey decried\u00a0Barry Goldwater\u2019s \u201cright-wing extremism\u201d and endorsements of and by groups like The John Birch Society, Communists, and the Ku Klux Klan, among others. Humphrey\u00a0pointed out that he and\u00a0Johnson renounced such groups in their campaign platform and discouraged their votes. \u201cWe repudiate them\u201d is\u00a0handwritten a second time on his speaking copy for emphasis.\n\u00a0at the Minnesota Historical Society.\n | ",
