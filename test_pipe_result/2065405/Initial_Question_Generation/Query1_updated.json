Americans across parties share many policy preferences. There is some overlap even on hot-button issues, such as abortion and guns, and more overlap on how to teach American history.1 It is important not to make too much of this overlap, however. For instance, a majority of Democrats as well as four in ten Republicans support banning high-capacity ammunition magazines and creating a federal database to track gun sales; nearly as many Republicans support banning assault-style weapons. But only 18 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaners feel gun violence is a major problem (versus 73 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaners). So despite the significant policy overlap, only one side is motivated to put the issue on the agenda.2 Democrats have moved to the left on racial issues and some social issues over the last decade, and Republicans have moved to the right on immigration under Joe Biden\u2019s administration, though there remains overlap on these issues as well.3 In some cases, Republicans appear to be slowly adopting more progressive views on some social issues, resulting in what looks like polarization but is perhaps better characterized as faster moves by the left.4\n    However, most partisans hold major misbeliefs about the other party\u2019s preferences that lead them to think there is far less shared policy belief. This perception gap is highest among progressive activists, followed closely by extreme conservatives: in other words, the people who are most involved in civic and political life hold the least accurate views of the other side\u2019s beliefs. Figure 1 shows the gap between what groups of Americans think the other side believes and what...[Content truncated]",

On ABC, anchor Harry Reasoner assured viewers the technical difficulties were \u201cnot a conspiracy against Governor Carter or President Ford.\u201d \nFor 27 minutes, as the nation watched and audio engineers scrambled, the two candidates appeared frozen in place as they stood stiffly in silence behind their podiums. \u201cI suspect both of us would have liked to sit down and relax while the technicians were fixing the system,\u201d Ford recounted to PBS newsman Jim Lehrer, \u201cbut I think both of us were hesitant to make any gesture that might look like we weren\u2019t physically or mentally able to handle a problem like this.\u201d\n5.

According to Nielsen Media Research, 84 million Americans tuned in on September 26, 2016 to watch Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump square off in their first debate. The tally didn't even include those who watched on the internet, mobile devices or on C-Span, none of which were rated by Nielsen. The 2016 numbers exceeded the previous debate audience record of 80.6 million set in 1980 when President Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan debated for the first and only time. The third-most watched presidential debate was the September 29, 2020 event between Joseph Biden and Donald Trump, drawing 73 million viewers.\n7.

Rick Perlstein, in his 2001 book, \u201cBefore the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus,\u201d summarizes the trimming strategy: \u201cGoldwater would take the line that Robert Welch was a crazy extremist but that the Society itself was full of fine, upstanding citizens working hard and well for the cause of Americanism.\u201d Throughout the 1964 race, Goldwater availed himself of Bircher money and manpower at the risk of being soldered, by his opponents, to the Birchers\u2019 more addled views, the most notorious of these being Welch\u2019s suggestion that Dwight Eisenhower had consciously acted as an agent of the international Communist conspiracy.\nThe association of Goldwater and the society helped to take both of them down. By 1968, Richard Nixon, a needle-threader extraordinaire, had captured the Presidency and cemented an identification with conservatism despite being loathed by the Birch leadership for a lack of true belief. Nixon had famously withheld his applause when Goldwater declared, at the 1964 Convention, that \u201cextremism in the defense of liberty is no vice\u201d; two years before that, he had been badly bruised by the society during his failed run for the governorship of California. (Screeching Bircher resistance during the Republican primary had left him exhausted for the general election.) After Nixon reached the White House, the dignified, mainstream sufferings of the \u201csilent majority,\u201d not the rants of the Birchers, became the engine of his feinting, flexible conservatism, which pivoted most audaciously with his decision to visit China in 1972.\nNo destination could have been more infuriating to the J.B.S., China being where its eponymous idol, a twenty-seven-year-old American missionary turned military intelligence officer, met his death at the hands of Mao Zedong\u2019s Red Army, on August 25, 1945\u2014becoming, in Welch\u2019s estimation, \u201cthe first casualty\u201d of the Cold War. Welch did not discover Birch\u2019s story until 1953: in his brief book \u201cThe Life of John Birch,\u201d published the following year, he describes how \u201call alone, in a committee room of the Senate Office Building in Washington, I was reading the dry typewritten pages in an unpublished report of an almost forgotten congressional committee hearing....[Content truncated]",
