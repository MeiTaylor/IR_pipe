Unsupervised topic clusters (all features and clusterings) at three resolu-tion levels scored against two commercial classification labels: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Open Calais (OC). Best clustering for each resolution level in boldface. \nFrom the NMI and ARI scores for all our experiments, we find that MS graph-partitioning provides the best correspondence to the external classifica-tions followed by k-means and Ward. LDA provides the worst scores against the external labels. Again, there is no clear winner among the features: tfidf+lsa ,\ntfidf and d2v (all with MS) produce the best results against external classes at the F, M and C levels. Among the Bert variants, baas performs better than sbert \nbut they do not outperform d2v .As visualisation aids, we use multilevel Sankey diagrams to represent rela-tionships between partitions, and wordclouds to represent the content of topic clusters. In Figure 2, we show the mapping of the external classes of the com-mercial services OC and GCP against the best unsupervised clustering at the F level, given by MS of Gtfidf+lsa .

I appreciate that, I really do, thank you.\nMUIR: I want to bring you in on this because you've made this central to your campaign right here in New Hampshire in the last couple of days. Four Years ago you said of Senator Rubio, he was ready to be Vice President. You spoke of his experience as well. You said he has the fortitude to be a good President, but just this week you said Senator Rubio accomplished, quote, \"nothing\" in the Senate. How do you square the two?\nBUSH: Well, first of all he said the exact same thing about me, that I would make a great Vice Presidential nominee when Mitt Romney was considering.
