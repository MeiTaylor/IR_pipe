We applaud Congress\u2019 ban on the FDA approval of research involving three-parent embryos. We believe the FDA\u2019s approval of Mifeprex, a dangerous abortifacient formerly known as RU-486, threatens women\u2019s health, as does the agency\u2019s endorsement of over-the-counter sales of powerful contraceptives without a physician\u2019s recommendation.

                    "content": "\n\nMarco Antonio Rubio (/\u02c8ru\u02d0bio\u028a/; born May 28, 1971) is an American politician and lawyer serving as the senior United States senator from Florida, a seat he has held since 2011. A member of the Republican Party, he served as Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives from 2006 to 2008. Rubio unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for President of the United States in 2016, but won presidential primaries in Minnesota, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.\n\nRubio is a Cuban American from Miami, Florida. After serving as a city commissioner for West Miami in the 1990s, he was elected to represent the 111th district in the Florida House of Representatives in 2000. Subsequently, he was elected speaker of the Florida House; he served for two years beginning in November 2006. Upon leaving the Florida legislature in 2008 due to term limits, Rubio taught at Florida International University.\n\nIn a three-way race, Rubio was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010. In April 2015, he launched a presidential bid instead of seeking reelection. He suspended his campaign for the presidency on March 15, 2016, after losing to Donald Trump in the Florida Republican primary. He then ran for reelection to the Senate and won a second term. Despite his criticism of Trump during the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, Rubio endorsed him before the 2016 general election and was largely supportive of his presidency. Due to his influence on U.S. policy on Latin America during the Trump administration, he was described as a \"virtual secretary of state for Latin America\".[1] Rubio became Florida's senior senator in January 2019, following the defeat of former Senator Bill Nelson, and was reelected to a third term in 2022, defeating Democratic nominee Val Demings. Rubio endorsed Trump for president in 2024 days before the Iowa caucuses.\n\nMarco Antonio Rubio was born in Miami, Florida,[2] the second son and third child of Mario Rubio Reina[3] and Oriales (n\u00e9e Garcia) Rubio. His parents were Cubans who immigrated to the United States in 1956 during the regime of Fulgencio Batista, two and a half years before Fidel Castro asc...[Content truncated]",

When we ask you a question you will have on minute to answer, and 30 seconds more if we ask a follow-up. If you're attacked by another candidate you get 30 seconds to respond.\nAnd, here's how we keep time. After we ask a question, you'll get a green light. The yellow light means you have 30 seconds left to finish you answer, and when time is up, the light turns red. That means please stop talking. If you keep talking you'll hear this.\n(BELL RINGING)\nYou don't want to hear that. Joining me in the questioning tonight, my CBS News colleague, Chief White House correspondent, Major Garrett, and Kimberly Strassel who is on the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal.\nAnd, you can participate in the debate to through our partnership with Twitter. Tweet us your questions and comments using the hashtag, \"#GOPDebate\".\nSo, let's begin.\nFirst, the death of Justice Scalia, and the vacancy that leaves on the Supreme Court. Mr. Trump, I want to start with you. You've said that the President shouldn't nominate anyone in the rest of his term to replace Justice Scalia. If you were President, and had a chance with 11 months left to go in your term, wouldn't it be an abdication to conservatives in particular, not to name a conservative justice with the rest of your term?\nTRUMP: Well, I can say this. If the President, and if I were President now I would certainly want to try and nominate a justice. I'm sure that, frankly, I'm absolutely sure that President Obama will try and do it. I hope that our Senate is going to be able -- Mitch, and the entire group, is going to be able to do something about it.\nIn times of delay, we could have a Diane Sykes, or you could have a Bill Pryor, we have some fantastic people. But this is a tremendous blow to conservatism. It's a tremendous blow, frankly to our country.\nDICKERSON: So, just to be clear on this Mr. Trump, you're OK with the President nominating somebody... TRUMP: ... I think he's going to do it whether or I'm OK with it or not. I think it's up to Mitch McConnell, and everybody else to stop it...[Content truncated]",

Readers who wish to comment on the Standards of Care are invited to do so at .\nClassification\n--------------\nDiabetes can be classified into the following general categories:\n1.  Type 1 diabetes (due to autoimmune \u03b2-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency, including latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood)\n2.  Type 2 diabetes (due to a progressive loss of adequate \u03b2-cell insulin secretion frequently on the background of insulin resistance)\n3.  Specific types of diabetes due to other causes, e.g., monogenic diabetes syndromes (such as neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young), diseases of the exocrine pancreas (such as cystic fibrosis and pancreatitis), and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes (such as with glucocorticoid use, in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, or after organ transplantation)\n4.  Gestational diabetes mellitus (diabetes diagnosed in the second or third trimester of pregnancy that was not clearly overt diabetes prior to gestation)\n_This section reviews most common forms of diabetes but is not comprehensive. For additional information, see the American Diabetes Association (ADA) position statement \u201cDiagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus\u201d_ (1).\nType 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are heterogeneous diseases in which clinical presentation and disease progression may vary considerably. Classification is important for determining therapy, but some individuals cannot be clearly classified as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes at the time of diagnosis. The traditional paradigms of type 2 diabetes occurring only in adults and type 1 diabetes only in children are no longer accurate, as both diseases occur in both age-groups. Children with type 1 diabetes typically present with the hallmark symptoms of polyuria/polydipsia, and approximately one-third present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) (2). The onset of type 1 diabetes may be more variable in adults; they may not present with the classic symptoms seen in children and may experience temporary remission from the need for insulin (3\u20135). Occasionally, patients with type 2 diabetes may present with DKA (6), particularly ethnic and racial minorities (7). It is important for the provider to realize that classification of diabetes type is not always straightforward at presentation and that misdiagnosis is common...[Content truncated]",
