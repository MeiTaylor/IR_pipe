Marco Rubio is a gifted, gifted politician, and he may have the skills to be a President of the United States, but we've tried it the old way with Barack Obama, with soaring eloquence and we got — we didn't get a leader we got someone who wants to divide the country up.

An estimated 12.5 million people were infected, . Though symptoms were generally minor – a fever and rash – pregnant women who contracted the virus faced a harsh reality. If their babies survived, there was a chance they would be born with profound birth defects, including blindness, deafness, heart abnormalities and serious intellectual disabilities.\nPrevious scares from infectious diseases in the United States had been largely relegated to the poor and those living in tenements, historian Leslie J.

When we ask you a question you will have on minute to answer, and 30 seconds more if we ask a follow-up. If you're attacked by another candidate you get 30 seconds to respond.\nAnd, here's how we keep time. After we ask a question, you'll get a green light.

Tweet us your questions and comments using the hashtag, \"#GOPDebate\".\nSo, let's begin.\nFirst, the death of Justice Scalia, and the vacancy that leaves on the Supreme Court. Mr. Trump, I want to start with you. You've said that the President shouldn't nominate anyone in the rest of his term to replace Justice Scalia. If you were President, and had a chance with 11 months left to go in your term, wouldn't it be an abdication to conservatives in particular, not to name a conservative justice with the rest of your term?\nTRUMP: Well, I can say this. If the President, and if I were President now I would certainly want to try and nominate a justice. I'm sure that, frankly, I'm absolutely sure that President Obama will try and do it. I hope that our Senate is going to be able -- Mitch, and the entire group, is going to be able to do something about it.\nIn times of delay, we could have a Diane Sykes, or you could have a Bill Pryor, we have some fantastic people. But this is a tremendous blow to conservatism. It's a tremendous blow, frankly to our country.\nDICKERSON: So, just to be clear on this Mr. Trump, you're OK with the President nominating somebody... TRUMP: ... I think he's going to do it whether or I'm OK with it or not. I think it's up to Mitch McConnell, and everybody else to stop it...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "Did Marco Rubio use religious language to justify his stance on abortion regarding Zika-related birth defects?",
        "Answer": "Marco Rubio did not explicitly use religious language to justify his stance on abortion regarding Zika-related birth defects; however, his comments reflect a belief in the sanctity of life that is often associated with religious perspectives. He has consistently articulated a pro-life stance, emphasizing that he believes all human life is worthy of legal protection from the moment of conception, regardless of the circumstances surrounding it. For example, he stated, \"If I’m going to err, I’m going to err on the side of life,\" which indicates a fundamental belief in protecting life that resonates with religiously-influenced views on morality and human dignity. While Rubio has argued that pregnant women infected with the Zika virus should not have the right to an abortion, even if their babies are likely to be born with serious birth defects like microcephaly, he did not frame this position directly in religious terms. Instead, he focused on a broader human rights perspective, asserting that all human life should be protected. His refusal to allow exceptions for abortions in cases of rape and incest also highlights a perspective that views life as inherently sacred, a viewpoint commonly found in religious discourse. In summary, while he did not use overtly religious language, his arguments reflect a belief system aligned with the sanctity of life, which is typically associated with religious doctrines on the matter. Thus, the analysis is that while Rubio's statements are imbued with moral conviction, they do not explicitly invoke religious language in the context of Zika-related birth defects.",
