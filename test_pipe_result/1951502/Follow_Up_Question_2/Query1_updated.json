Among the Bert variants, baas performs better than sbert \nbut they do not outperform d2v .As visualisation aids, we use multilevel Sankey diagrams to represent rela-tionships between partitions, and wordclouds to represent the content of topic clusters. In Figure 2, we show the mapping of the external classes of the com-mercial services OC and GCP against the best unsupervised clustering at the F level, given by MS of Gtfidf+lsa . Our clustering shows strong agreement with the large categories in both OC and GCP with additional detail in several groupings. 8 Altuncu et al. \nbirth control \nzika virus \nbirth defect \npregnant women \npublic health \naedes aegypti \nhealth officials \nmosquito bear \nzika spread \nteen birth \ncenter disease \ndisease control \nsexual transmission \ncenter disease control \ncontrol prevention \ndisease control prevention \nsexually transmit \nyellow fever \npuerto rico \nunite state \nzika outbreak \nget pregnant \nmosquito bite \nzika case \nvirus spread \ngene drive \ninfectious diseases health emergency \nguillain barr\u00e9 \nguinea worm \nhealth organization \nmosquito control \nworld health \nlatin america \nteen birthrate \nworld health organization \nplan parenthood \nzika cause \npublic health emergency \npeople infect \naedes albopictus \nvirus circulate \naegypti mosquitoes \nspread virus \nshow symptoms \ninfect zika \ncase zika \ntransmit virus \nlink zika \nteenage girls \ntfidf+lsa + MS - F Level (23) - Training subset - Comm. 21 w. 114 documents \nfull frontal \nstephen colbert \ndaily show \ndonald trump \noliver say \nlate show \nsamantha bee \nlast week tonight \nweek tonight \nbee say \ncolbert say \njohn oliver \n...[Content truncated]",

I appreciate that, I really do, thank you.\nMUIR: I want to bring you in on this because you've made this central to your campaign right here in New Hampshire in the last couple of days. Four Years ago you said of Senator Rubio, he was ready to be Vice President. You spoke of his experience as well. You said he has the fortitude to be a good President, but just this week you said Senator Rubio accomplished, quote, \"nothing\" in the Senate. How do you square the two?\nBUSH: Well, first of all he said the exact same thing about me, that I would make a great Vice Presidential nominee when Mitt Romney was considering. I said the same thing about Marco. I think we were both right at the time, and Mitt picked somebody else. So, let's move on to the 2016 race. Who has the leadership skills... [applause]...who has the leadership skills to lead? And, I'm proud of the fact that I have 12 Medal of Honor recipients, over 30 admirals and generals that believe that I would be a steady hand as Commander in Chief. That I serve as Governor of the state of Florida where we cut taxes and reduced government. I took on very powerful interests, forged consensus, fought for my beliefs, implemented them and the state was better off.\nWe had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms in 16 months. The whole state was turned upside down. It required a steady hand. Leadership. You learn this, you learn it by doing it. It's not something that you just go up, and on the job do it. [applause]\nIt's not the same. Look, let's be clear. Marco Rubio is a gifted, gifted politician, and he may have the skills to be a President of the United States, but we've tried it the old way with Barack Obama, with soaring eloquence and we got \u2014 we didn't get a leader we got someone who wants to divide the country up. The next President...[bell rings]...going to have to forge consensus to bring about a set of common purposes so that we can move forward again in this country...\nMUIR: ... We're going to continue with leadership now. Martha?\nRADDATZ: Senator Cruz, you are a first term Senator as well.
