Four Years ago you said of Senator Rubio, he was ready to be Vice President. You spoke of his experience as well. You said he has the fortitude to be a good President, but just this week you said Senator Rubio accomplished, quote, \"nothing\" in the Senate. How do you square the two?\nBUSH: Well, first of all he said the exact same thing about me, that I would make a great Vice Presidential nominee when Mitt Romney was considering. I said the same thing about Marco. I think we were both right at the time, and Mitt picked somebody else. So, let's move on to the 2016 race. Who has the leadership skills...

I took on very powerful interests, forged consensus, fought for my beliefs, implemented them and the state was better off.\nWe had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms in 16 months. The whole state was turned upside down. It required a steady hand. Leadership. You learn this, you learn it by doing it. It's not something that you just go up, and on the job do it. [applause]\nIt's not the same. Look, let's be clear. Marco Rubio is a gifted, gifted politician, and he may have the skills to be a President of the United States, but we've tried it the old way with Barack Obama, with soaring eloquence and we got — we didn't get a leader we got someone who wants to divide the country up.

        "Question": "Did Marco Rubio say Zika-linked birth defects are God's punishment and reject abortion?",
        "Answer": "Based on the available evidence, Marco Rubio did not directly state that Zika-linked birth defects are God's punishment. However, he has expressed a strong anti-abortion stance, indicating that he does not believe women infected with the Zika virus should be allowed to have abortions even if their babies are born with microcephaly, which is a severe developmental disorder associated with Zika. Rubio stated, \"If I’m going to err, I’m going to err on the side of life.\" This demonstrates his commitment to a pro-life position, irrespective of the circumstances surrounding the pregnancy. Rubio's views on abortion can be summarized as follows: 1. He opposes abortion in all instances but is open to legislation that includes exceptions, which demonstrate a nuanced position. He supports laws that protect life from the moment of conception, indicating that all human life deserves legal protection despite the circumstances. 2. In a broader context, Rubio has articulated that human life is worthy of protection from conception, and he has indicated he will not change his pro-life views, implying that abortion represents an evasion of the natural course of life. His opposition to abortion in instances of rape and incest further indicates his belief that life should be preserved regardless of how it was conceived. Therefore, while Rubio did not explicitly frame Zika-linked birth defects as \"God's punishment,\" his comments reflect a belief that life, in all forms, is to be honored and preserved, aligning with a typically religious viewpoint on the sanctity of life.",
