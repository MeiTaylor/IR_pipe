Rubio, who has championed Zika funding bills in the Senate, also blamed Democrats for the failure to pass such federal aid.\nAccording to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) figures, Florida is the state second-worst affected by Zika, after New York, but is the only state to have infections caused by local mosquitoes. Most Zika cases in the US have been found in people who travelled to affected countries and territories.\nOn Sunday, the Florida governor, Rick Scott, told NBC that despite his state having identified 16 cases of mosquito-borne Zika infections, \u201cwhat we\u2019re doing is working.\u201d\nScott also called for increased federal aid, in addition to the several million Barack Obama has released in existing grants. On Friday, the federal Food and Drug Administration cleared a private company to release genetically altered mosquitoes which could help the fight against Zika on an island in the Florida Keys.

His colleague and rival Ted Cruz has dismissed\u00a0him as a \"moderate.\" Liberal commentators have argued\u00a0that Rubio is\u00a0just as\u00a0extreme as his rivals.\nIn fact, Rubio\u00a0is an unusual\u00a0figure in Republican politics who does not fit neatly into any of the party's factions.\nThe tea-party movement in 2010 carried him into Congress, and his views on issues such as gay marriage and abortion are\u00a0staunchly conservative.

John McCain (R-Ariz.), also known as\u00a0\"The Maverick\" -- Rubio has often sought his own way in public life, producing detailed proposals on a range of subjects while making plenty of\u00a0enemies left, right and center.\nBy one measure, though, Rubio now has a better chance of\u00a0winning the GOP\u00a0presidential nod than all of his...[Content truncated]",

As the probable Republican nominee.\nAccording to odds makers and prediction markets, he\u2019s the best bet. According to many commentators, too.\nBut Iowa\u2019s less than a month away, and in two recent polls of Republican voters there, he\u2019s a distant third, far behind Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.\nSo he\u2019s killing it in New Hampshire, right?\nWrong. A survey from two weeks ago had him second to Trump there, but another, just days earlier, put him in third place \u2014 after Trump and Cruz, again. Chris Christie\u2019s inching up on him, the reasons for which were abundantly clear in  of Christie\u2019s freewheeling campaign style and Rubio\u2019s hyper-controlled one by The Times\u2019s Michael Barbaro.\nAnd as of Thursday, the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls in South Carolina showed Rubio to be more than six points behind Cruz and 21 behind Trump among that state\u2019s Republicans. There\u2019s no inkling of a surge, and it\u2019s not as if pro-Rubio forces have been holding off on advertising that will turn the tide.  have already run.\nIn fact the rap on Rubio is that he counts too much on them and spends  on the trail. The largest newspaper in New Hampshire took aim at the infrequency of his appearances there in  with the headline: \u201cMarco? Marco?

Marco Rubio has pitched himself as the candidate of the future- a fresh face for the GOP who will bring a fresh approach to policy problems that have long been frozen in place by partisan warfare.\n On domestic issues like education and the economy, he's carved a fairly standard GOP profile, embracing private school vouchers and tax cuts while opposing Common Core education standards and Obamacare. He's been reliably conservative on social issues like abortion and same-sex marriage, and his approach to foreign policy tends to be more hawkish.\nOne notable sticking point for Rubio among conservatives has been his stance on immigration. He sponsored a comprehensive reform bill that included a path to citizenship in 2013, and he's since backed away from that effort, but he's continued stressing the need to overhaul U.S. immigration policy.\nThus far, his approach has earned him a solid - but not dominant - placement in early primary polls, behind more high-profile candidates like Jeb Bush and Donald Trump, but ahead of a number of lesser-known contenders.\nHere's a look at what Marco Rubio stands for:\nRubio, like many Republicans, has generally pushed for a small federal role in education policy. He opposes Common Core state education standards, arguing they began as a \"well-intentioned effort\" to raise standards but have since become a tool for the federal government to set curriculum. He has called for programs like Head Start to be turned over to the states for the sake of \"flexibility.\"\nRubio has also embraced the school choice movement, sponsoring several measures to expand the use of vouchers and charter schools. As a state lawmaker in Florida, Rubio helped then-Gov. Jeb Bush implement the \"A+ Education Plan,\" which expanded school choice and...[Content truncated]",
