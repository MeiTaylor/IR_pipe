Rubio, who has championed Zika funding bills in the Senate, also blamed Democrats for the failure to pass such federal aid.\nAccording to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) figures, Florida is the state second-worst affected by Zika, after New York, but is the only state to have infections caused by local mosquitoes. Most Zika cases in the US have been found in people who travelled to affected countries and territories.\nOn Sunday, the Florida governor, Rick Scott, told NBC that despite his state having identified 16 cases of mosquito-borne Zika infections, \u201cwhat we\u2019re doing is working.\u201d\nScott also called for increased federal aid, in addition to the several million Barack Obama has released in existing grants.

Marco Rubio said he is going \"to err on the side of life\" when it comes to pregnant women infected with the Zika virus having abortions.\n!\nBy \nUPDATED: April 8, 2018 at 7:46 p.m.\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Saturday that he doesn\u2019t think pregnant women infected with the Zika virus should be able to have an abortion.\nZika, which has infected 1,400 people in America, can cause birth defects in the babies of women infected with the disease, including microcephaly \u2014 a serious condition where newborn babies are born with unnaturally small heads.\n\u201cI understand a lot of people disagree with my view \u2014 but I believe that all human life is worthy of protection of our laws. And when you present it in the context of Zika or any prenatal condition, it\u2019s a difficult question and a hard one,\u201d Rubio told Politico during an interview Saturday. \u201cBut \u2026 I\u2019m going to err on the side of life.\u201d\n!\nA child born in Brazil has a very small head due to a birth defect called microcephaly.\n\u201cObviously, microcephaly is a terrible prenatal condition that kids are born with. And when they are, it\u2019s a lifetime of difficulties,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I get it. I\u2019m not pretending to you that that\u2019s an easy question you asked me. But I\u2019m pro-life. And I\u2019m strongly pro-life. I believe all human life should be protected by our law, irrespective of the circumstances or condition of that life.\u201d\nOriginally Published: August 7, 2016 at 12:09 p.m.\n### Share this:\n*   \n*   \nMost Popular\n------------\nMost Popular\n*   ### RIP student bus passes and student MetroCards\n*   ### NYC pedestrian crushed to death in chain-reaction crash sparked...[Content truncated]",

These communications may provide digital markers of attitudes, behaviors, and knowledge in a population, thus supplying an easily accessible thermometer of variations in psychological responses that are important for public policy. In this paper, our objective was to identify these markers by correlating Twitter data with survey measures of attitudes, behaviors, and knowledge in a representative sample of the US adult population.\nStudying attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors has a longstanding theoretical interest. People\u2019s attitudes and knowledge about the world allow them to make behavioral decisions and avoid public health threats throughout the course of their lives. An attitude is regarded as an evaluation of an object as positive or negative \\. For example, an attitude relevant to Zika may entail favoring policies that can reduce infection, such as spraying. These attitudes may be linked to knowledge\u2014factual information about the life cycle of the _Aedes_ mosquitos and types of transmission of the Zika virus, for example. Attitudes may be assessed with semantic differential, Likert, or other items tapping evaluations, whereas knowledge measures involve true/false determinations about factual statements about Zika. Attitudes and knowledge as well as...[Content truncated]",

The CZS is considered a specific pattern of\n                    birth defects caused by ZIKV infection, which is transmitted by the bite of the\n                    Aedes aegypti mosquito. The CZS clinical manifestations are broad and\n                    nonspecific, including microcephaly, subcortical calcifications, ocular\n                    alterations, congenital contractures, early hypertonia, and pyramidal as well as\n                    extrapyramidal symptoms. The ZIKV has gained great importance because it has\n                    affected a large percentage of the population worldwide during the last few\n                    years, despite the measures implemented by international organizations. The\n                    pathophysiology and non-vectorial transmission routes of the virus are still\n                    under study. The diagnosis is made upon suspicion of ZIKV...[Content truncated]",
