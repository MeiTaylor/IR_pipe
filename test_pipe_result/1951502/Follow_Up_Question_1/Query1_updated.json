There\u2019s a several block area in north Miami where we have confirmed mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus. This is what we expected. Based on what we know now, it appears that that transmission occurred in early July and after that point the local health department did aggressive mosquito control in that area.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but I do know that over the coming weeks and months we are very likely to see isolated cases of mosquito-borne Zika. That\u2019s why we say to particularly pregnant women anywhere in the US that you should be using mosquito repellent, wearing long sleeves and staying indoors to avoid mosquito bites where the Aedes aegypti mosquito is present.\u201d \u201cSo men whose partners are pregnant also need to take precaution. So, if a man travels to another country where Zika is spreading he should use a condom until the end of his partner\u2019s pregnancy.\u201d\n!\nDr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said there would most likely be additional isolated cases of mosquito-borne Zika, and offered preventive measures.CreditCredit...Scott McIntyre for The New York Times\n*   July 29, 2016\nFour cases of  infection in Florida are very likely to have been caused by mosquitoes there, the State Department of Health said Friday \u2014 the first documented instances of local transmission in the continental United States.\n\u201cZika is now here,\u201d Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a news briefing.\nThe C.D.C. and Florida officials said that for now, the area of concern is limited to one square mile in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami, a gentrifying area with restaurants and art galleries just north of downtown.\nHealth authorities are not advising people to stay away from the neighborhood, Dr. Frieden said. The four people appear to have been infected in early July; since then, mosquito control efforts have been stepped up in the area, and additional cases have not been identified.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t currently see a situation where we would advise people not to travel there or advise pregnant women not to travel there,\u201d Dr. Frieden said. But he said that this advice could change if the number of cases increased substantially.\nVideo\ntranscript\ntranscript\nUnderstanding Zika\n------------------\n#### How dangerous is the virus and who is most at risk?\nna\n!\nHow dangerous is the virus and who is most at risk?CreditCredit...Luis Robayo/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images...[Content truncated]",

I appreciate that, I really do, thank you.\nMUIR: I want to bring you in on this because you've made this central to your campaign right here in New Hampshire in the last couple of days. Four Years ago you said of Senator Rubio, he was ready to be Vice President. You spoke of his experience as well. You said he has the fortitude to be a good President, but just this week you said Senator Rubio accomplished, quote, \"nothing\" in the Senate. How do you square the two?\nBUSH: Well, first of all he said the exact same thing about me, that I would make a great Vice Presidential nominee when Mitt Romney was considering. I said the same thing about Marco. I think we were both right at the time, and Mitt picked somebody else. So, let's move on to the 2016 race. Who has the leadership skills...

And, I'm proud of the fact that I have 12 Medal of Honor recipients, over 30 admirals and generals that believe that I would be a steady hand as Commander in Chief. That I serve as Governor of the state of Florida where we cut taxes and reduced government. I took on very powerful interests, forged consensus, fought for my beliefs, implemented them and the state was better off.\nWe had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms in 16 months. The whole state was turned upside down. It required a steady hand. Leadership. You learn this, you learn it by doing it. It's not something that you just go up, and on the job do it. [applause]\nIt's not the same. Look, let's be clear. Marco Rubio is a gifted, gifted politician, and he may have the skills to be a President of the United States, but we've tried it the old way with Barack Obama, with soaring eloquence and we got \u2014 we didn't get a leader we got someone who wants to divide the country up. The next President...[bell rings]...going to have to forge consensus to bring about a set of common purposes so that we can move forward again in this country...\nMUIR: ... We're going to continue with leadership now. Martha?\nRADDATZ: Senator Cruz, you are a first term Senator as well.

I am proud to be a Christian and as President I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened, unlike what is happening now, with our current President. No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man\u2019s religion or faith. They are using the Pope as a pawn and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant.\n**PHOTOS:** \nSeveral other Republican presidential candidates have endorsed building a wall or fence along the U.S.-Mexico border, including Cruz, Sen.

Unsupervised topic clusters (all features and clusterings) at three resolu-tion levels scored against two commercial classification labels: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Open Calais (OC). Best clustering for each resolution level in boldface. \nFrom the NMI and ARI scores for all our experiments, we find that MS graph-partitioning provides the best correspondence to the external classifica-tions followed by k-means and Ward. LDA provides the worst scores against the external labels. Again, there is no clear winner among the features: tfidf+lsa ,\ntfidf and d2v (all with MS) produce the best results against external classes at the F, M and C levels. Among the Bert variants, baas performs better than sbert \nbut they do not outperform d2v .As visualisation aids, we use multilevel Sankey diagrams to represent rela-tionships between partitions, and wordclouds to represent the content of topic clusters. In Figure 2, we show the mapping of the external classes of the com-mercial services OC and GCP against the best unsupervised clustering at the F level, given by MS of Gtfidf+lsa .
