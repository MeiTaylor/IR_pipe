An estimated 12.5 million people were infected, . Though symptoms were generally minor – a fever and rash – pregnant women who contracted the virus faced a harsh reality. If their babies survived, there was a chance they would be born with profound birth defects, including blindness, deafness, heart abnormalities and serious intellectual disabilities.\nPrevious scares from infectious diseases in the United States had been largely relegated to the poor and those living in tenements, historian Leslie J. Reagan wrote in her 2010 book, “Dangerous Pregnancies.” But this epidemic respected no boundaries and threw white middle-class married mothers...[Content truncated]",

Marco Rubio said he is going \"to err on the side of life\" when it comes to pregnant women infected with the Zika virus having abortions.\n!\nBy \nUPDATED: April 8, 2018 at 7:46 p.m.\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Saturday that he doesn’t think pregnant women infected with the Zika virus should be able to have an abortion.\nZika, which has infected 1,400 people in America, can cause birth defects in the babies of women infected with the disease, including microcephaly — a serious condition where newborn babies are born with unnaturally small heads.\n“I understand a lot of people disagree with my view — but I believe that all human life is worthy of protection of our laws. And when you present it in the context of Zika or any prenatal condition, it’s a difficult question and a hard one,” Rubio told Politico during an interview Saturday. “But … I’m going to err on the side of life.”\n!\nA child born in Brazil has a very small head due to a birth defect called microcephaly.\n“Obviously, microcephaly is a terrible prenatal condition that kids are born with. And when they are, it’s a lifetime of difficulties,” he said. “So I get it. I’m not pretending to you that that’s an easy question you asked me. But I’m pro-life. And I’m strongly pro-life. I believe all human life should be protected by our law, irrespective of the circumstances or condition of that life.”\nOriginally Published: August 7, 2016 at 12:09 p.m.\n### Share this:\n*   \n*   \nMost Popular\n------------\nMost Popular\n*   ### RIP student bus passes and student MetroCards\n*   ### NYC pedestrian crushed to death in chain-reaction crash sparked...[Content truncated]",

These discussions may provide useful information about attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors of the population regarding issues that are important for public policy. Objective: We sought to identify the associations of the topics of discussions on Twitter and survey measures of Zika-related attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors, not solely based upon the volume of such discussions but by analyzing the content of conversations using probabilistic techniques. Methods: Using probabilistic topic modeling with US county and week as the unit of analysis, we analyzed the content of Twitter online communications to identify topics related to the reported attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors captured in a national representative survey (N=33,193) of the US adult population over 33 weeks. Results: Our analyses revealed topics related to “congress funding for Zika,” “micro",

These communications may provide digital markers of attitudes, behaviors, and knowledge in a population, thus supplying an easily accessible thermometer of variations in psychological responses that are important for public policy. In this paper, our objective was to identify these markers by correlating Twitter data with survey measures of attitudes, behaviors, and knowledge in a representative sample of the US adult population.\nStudying attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors has a longstanding theoretical interest. People’s attitudes and knowledge about the world allow them to make behavioral decisions and avoid public health threats throughout the course of their lives. An attitude is regarded as an evaluation of an object as positive or negative \\. For example, an attitude relevant to Zika may entail favoring policies that can reduce infection, such as spraying. These attitudes may be linked to knowledge—factual information about the life cycle of the _Aedes_ mosquitos and types of transmission of the Zika virus, for example. Attitudes may be assessed with semantic differential, Likert, or other items tapping evaluations, whereas knowledge measures involve true/false determinations about factual statements about Zika. Attitudes and knowledge as well as...[Content truncated]",

The CZS is considered a specific pattern of\n                    birth defects caused by ZIKV infection, which is transmitted by the bite of the\n                    Aedes aegypti mosquito.
