That’s why we say to particularly pregnant women anywhere in the US that you should be using mosquito repellent, wearing long sleeves and staying indoors to avoid mosquito bites where the Aedes aegypti mosquito is present.” “So men whose partners are pregnant also need to take precaution.

Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a news briefing.\nThe C.D.C. and Florida officials said that for now, the area of concern is limited to one square mile in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami, a gentrifying area with restaurants and art galleries just north of downtown.\nHealth authorities are not advising people to stay away from the neighborhood, Dr. Frieden said. The four people appear to have been infected in early July; since then, mosquito control efforts have been stepped up in the area, and additional cases have not been identified.\n“We don’t currently see a situation where we would advise people not to travel there or advise pregnant women not to travel there,” Dr. Frieden said. But he said that this advice could change if the number of cases increased substantially.\nVideo\ntranscript\ntranscript\nUnderstanding Zika\n------------------\n#### How dangerous is the virus and who is most at risk?\nna\n!\nHow dangerous is the virus and who is most at risk?CreditCredit...Luis Robayo/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images...[Content truncated]",

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Saturday that he doesn’t think pregnant women infected with the Zika virus should be able to have an abortion.\nZika, which has infected 1,400 people in America, can cause birth defects in the babies of women infected with the disease, including microcephaly — a serious condition where newborn babies are born with unnaturally small heads.\n“I understand a lot of people disagree with my view — but I believe that all human life is worthy of protection of our laws. And when you present it in the context of Zika or any prenatal condition, it’s a difficult question and a hard one,” Rubio told Politico during an interview Saturday. “But … I’m going to err on the side of life.”\n!\nA child born in Brazil has a very small head due to a birth defect called microcephaly.\n“Obviously, microcephaly is a terrible prenatal condition that kids are born with. And when they are, it’s a lifetime of difficulties,” he said. “So I get it. I’m not pretending to you that that’s an easy question you asked me. But I’m pro-life. And I’m strongly pro-life. I believe all human life should be protected by our law, irrespective of the circumstances or condition of that life.”\nOriginally Published: August 7, 2016 at 12:09 p.m.\n### Share this:\n*   \n*   \nMost Popular\n------------\nMost Popular\n*   ### RIP student bus passes and student MetroCards\n*   ### NYC pedestrian crushed to death in chain-reaction crash sparked...[Content truncated]",

            "content": "Florida senator and former presidential candidate says he will ‘err on the side of life’ even if babies will have microcephaly\nFlorida senator Marco Rubio has said women infected with the Zika virus should not be allowed to have abortions, even if their babies have microcephaly, the severe developmental disorder than can result from infection with the disease.\n“If I’m going to err, I’m going to err on the side of life,” the Republican told Politico. Rubio, who has championed Zika funding bills in the Senate, also blamed Democrats for the failure to pass such federal aid.\nAccording to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) figures, Florida is the state second-worst affected by Zika, after New York, but is the only state to have infections caused by local mosquitoes. Most Zika cases in the US have been found in people who travelled to affected countries and territories.\nOn Sunday, the Florida governor, Rick Scott, told NBC that despite his state having identified 16 cases of mosquito-borne Zika infections, “what we’re doing is working.”\nScott also called for increased federal aid, in addition to the several million Barack Obama has released in existing grants. On Friday, the federal Food and Drug Administration cleared a private company to release genetically altered mosquitoes which could help the fight against Zika on an island in the Florida Keys. The project will be subject to a local referendum in November.\nRubio ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination and only recently decided to run for re-election rather than give up public life. During the presidential campaign, he said he was opposed to...[Content truncated]"

Marco Rubio said he is going \"to err on the side of life\" when it comes to pregnant women infected with the Zika virus having abortions.\n!\nBy \nUPDATED: April 8, 2018 at 7:46 p.m.\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Saturday that he doesn’t think pregnant women infected with the Zika virus should be able to have an abortion.\nZika, which has infected 1,400 people in America, can cause birth defects in the babies of women infected with the disease, including microcephaly — a serious condition where newborn babies are born with unnaturally small heads.\n“I understand a lot of people disagree with my view — but I believe that all human life is worthy of protection of our laws. And when you present it in the context of Zika or any prenatal condition, it’s a difficult question and a hard one,” Rubio told Politico during an interview Saturday. “But … I’m going to err on the side of life.”\n!\nA child born in Brazil has a very small head due to a birth defect called microcephaly.\n“Obviously, microcephaly is a terrible prenatal condition that kids are born with. And when they are, it’s a lifetime of difficulties,” he said. “So I get it. I’m not pretending to you that that’s an easy question you asked me. But I’m pro-life. And I’m strongly pro-life. I believe all human life should be protected by our law, irrespective of the circumstances or condition of that life.”\nOriginally Published: August 7, 2016 at 12:09 p.m.\n### Share this:\n*   \n*   \nMost Popular\n------------\nMost Popular\n*   ### RIP student bus passes and student MetroCards\n*   ### NYC pedestrian crushed to death in chain-reaction crash sparked...[Content truncated]"

An estimated 12.5 million people were infected, . Though symptoms were generally minor – a fever and rash – pregnant women who contracted the virus faced a harsh reality. If their babies survived, there was a chance they would be born with profound birth defects, including blindness, deafness, heart abnormalities and serious intellectual disabilities.\nPrevious scares from infectious diseases in the United States had been largely relegated to the poor and those living in tenements, historian Leslie J.

    "QA": {
        "Question": "Did Marco Rubio explicitly link his views on abortion to Zika-linked birth defects during public statements or interviews?",
        "Answer": "Marco Rubio did not explicitly link his views on abortion to Zika-linked birth defects in a direct manner that frames the defects as God's punishment or divine judgment. However, he has made public statements about abortion in the context of the Zika virus, notably expressing that pregnant women infected with the Zika virus should not be allowed to have abortions, even in cases where their babies may be born with serious birth defects like microcephaly. Rubio stated, \"If I’m going to err, I’m going to err on the side of life,\" indicating his pro-life stance, which reflects a belief in the sanctity of life regardless of circumstances surrounding a pregnancy. He recognized the challenges posed by conditions such as microcephaly but maintained that all human life deserves legal protection, saying, \"I believe all human life should be protected by our law, irrespective of the circumstances or condition of that life.\" Therefore, while Rubio's anti-abortion position aligns with religious and moral beliefs about the sanctity of life, he did not directly frame the Zika-linked birth defects as divine punishment in his statements. Instead, his comments focus on the inherent value of life, irrespective of how it is conceived or the potential hardships involved.",
