There’s a several block area in north Miami where we have confirmed mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus. This is what we expected. Based on what we know now, it appears that that transmission occurred in early July and after that point the local health department did aggressive mosquito control in that area.” “We don’t have a crystal ball, but I do know that over the coming weeks and months we are very likely to see isolated cases of mosquito-borne Zika. That’s why we say to particularly pregnant women anywhere in the US that you should be using mosquito repellent, wearing long sleeves and staying indoors to avoid mosquito bites where the Aedes aegypti mosquito is present.” “So men whose partners are pregnant also need to take precaution. So, if a man travels to another country where Zika is spreading he should use a condom until the end of his partner’s pregnancy.”\n!\nDr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said there would most likely be additional isolated cases of mosquito-borne Zika, and offered preventive measures.CreditCredit...Scott McIntyre for The New York Times\n*   July 29, 2016\nFour cases of  infection in Florida are very likely to have been caused by mosquitoes there, the State Department of Health said Friday — the first documented instances of local transmission in the continental United States.\n“Zika is now here,” Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a news briefing.\nThe C.D.C. and Florida officials said that for now, the area of concern is limited to one square mile in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami, a gentrifying area with restaurants and art galleries just north of downtown.\nHealth authorities are not advising people to stay away from the neighborhood, Dr. Frieden said. The four people appear to have been infected in early July; since then, mosquito control efforts have been stepped up in the area, and additional cases have not been identified.\n“We don’t currently see a situation where we would advise people not to travel there or advise pregnant women not to travel there,” Dr. Frieden said. But he said that this advice could change if the number of cases increased substantially.\nVideo\ntranscript\ntranscript\nUnderstanding Zika\n------------------\n#### How dangerous is the virus and who is most at risk?\nna\n!\nHow dangerous is the virus and who is most at risk?CreditCredit...Luis Robayo/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images...[Content truncated]",

Four Years ago you said of Senator Rubio, he was ready to be Vice President. You spoke of his experience as well. You said he has the fortitude to be a good President, but just this week you said Senator Rubio accomplished, quote, \"nothing\" in the Senate. How do you square the two?\nBUSH: Well, first of all he said the exact same thing about me, that I would make a great Vice Presidential nominee when Mitt Romney was considering. I said the same thing about Marco. I think we were both right at the time, and Mitt picked somebody else. So, let's move on to the 2016 race. Who has the leadership skills...

I took on very powerful interests, forged consensus, fought for my beliefs, implemented them and the state was better off.\nWe had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms in 16 months.

Marco Rubio is a gifted, gifted politician, and he may have the skills to be a President of the United States, but we've tried it the old way with Barack Obama, with soaring eloquence and we got — we didn't get a leader we got someone who wants to divide the country up.

Unsupervised topic clusters (all features and clusterings) at three resolu-tion levels scored against two commercial classification labels: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Open Calais (OC). Best clustering for each resolution level in boldface. \nFrom the NMI and ARI scores for all our experiments, we find that MS graph-partitioning provides the best correspondence to the external classifica-tions followed by k-means and Ward. LDA provides the worst scores against the external labels. Again, there is no clear winner among the features: tfidf+lsa ,\ntfidf and d2v (all with MS) produce the best results against external classes at the F, M and C levels. Among the Bert variants, baas performs better than sbert \nbut they do not outperform d2v .As visualisation aids, we use multilevel Sankey diagrams to represent rela-tionships between partitions, and wordclouds to represent the content of topic clusters. In Figure 2, we show the mapping of the external classes of the com-mercial services OC and GCP against the best unsupervised clustering at the F level, given by MS of Gtfidf+lsa . Our clustering shows strong agreement with the large categories in both OC and GCP with additional detail in several groupings. 8 Altuncu et al. \nbirth control \nzika virus \nbirth defect \npregnant women \npublic health \naedes aegypti \nhealth officials \nmosquito bear \nzika spread \nteen birth \ncenter disease \ndisease control \nsexual transmission \ncenter disease control \ncontrol prevention \ndisease control prevention \nsexually transmit \nyellow fever \npuerto rico \nunite state \nzika outbreak \nget pregnant \nmosquito bite \nzika case \nvirus spread \ngene drive \ninfectious diseases health emergency \nguillain barré \nguinea worm \nhealth organization \nmosquito control \nworld health \nlatin america \nteen birthrate \nworld health organization \nplan parenthood \nzika cause \npublic health emergency \npeople infect \naedes albopictus \nvirus circulate \naegypti mosquitoes \nspread virus \nshow symptoms \ninfect zika \ncase zika \ntransmit virus \nlink zika \nteenage girls \ntfidf+lsa + MS - F Level (23) - Training subset - Comm. 21 w. 114 documents \nfull frontal \nstephen colbert \ndaily show \ndonald trump \noliver say \nlate show \nsamantha bee \nlast week tonight \nweek tonight \nbee say \ncolbert say \njohn oliver \n...[Content truncated]",
