  "Claim": "A hostess named Deborah Gail Stone working the America Sings attraction was crushed to death by a rotating wall.",
  "Video_information": {'video_date': 20210629.0, 'platform': 'tiktok', 'video_headline': '#worstdeathimaginable #deborahgailstone #americasings #disneyland #truecrime #death #worstwaystodie #crushed #crimetiktok #makingatruecrimerer', 'video_transcript': "This is worst deaths imaginable number 11, and it's also another death at Disneyland. This was Deborah Gayle Stone. She was born on June 18, 1956. Deborah was known to be extremely outgoing, friendly, and quite honestly, the perfect person to work at Disneyland Park. She sort of embodied the persona of the happiest place on earth. She graduated high school in 1974 and that's when she got one of her dream gigs. She was hired to be a hostess at Disneyland. Shortly before she was hired, Disneyland opened up a new attraction called America Sings. This would be one of a couple of attractions Disneyland's had over the years that, well, that involved terrifying singing animatronics as their lead cast. The show is basically a musical celebrating America's bicentennial, and it was hosted by a terrifying animatronic Bald Eagle. America Sings was basically a carousel theater, meaning it would rotate. It had an outer ring of 6 theaters and they were connected by divider walls. Solid walls. And they revolved mechanically around every 2 to 4 minutes. And then there were 6 fixed stages in the middle of all of this where the things would rotate around. On July 8, 1974, literally just a week and a half after this attraction opened, 18 year old Deborah Gail Stone, who was a hostess for the show, well, around 10:30 that evening, right around the last show, as she was backing up to sort of get out of view of the show, she accidentally slipped between a very, very narrow passageway. Now, this was between a stationary solid wall and one of the rotating stage walls. Now, they don't know if she fell or she slipped or if she tried to jump from stage to stage, but the fact of the matter is is she got stuck between those 2 different walls, and she could actually be heard screaming, screaming in agony and in pain because she was literally being crushed by the rotating stage and the solid wall behind her. I mean, we're talking a very, very narrow little section she was in, and the stage was rotating for at least 2 minutes, if not 4 minutes, constantly crushing her. Audience members reportedly heard her screaming, but some of them thought it was part of the show or that it was happening somewhere outside. But a couple other guests would inform the park staff after the last show, and when the stage is rotated for the last time, Deborah Gale Stone's body was found. Her death likely was not instant as she was slowly crushed to death, screaming for help, but no one would help her. Her family sued Disneyland, of course, and they won a small settlement. The attraction was closed for a few days while they installed safety lights, and the attraction would close forever in 1988.", 'Video_descriptor': "The video opens with a man in a blue shirt positioned in front of a painting portraying a bear, engaging with the camera as the bear painting is showcased. Subsequently, the man displays another painting depicting a man in a blue shirt and continues addressing the camera. The video alternates between images of the man in a blue shirt and the bear painting, with the individual in the blue shirt conversing with the camera throughout. The progression culminates with the man in the blue shirt delivering a final address to the camera. Key frame highlights from the video provide additional context, with various images suggesting a TikTok-style format, incorporating elements such as text overlays with phrases like 'WORST DEATHS IMAGINABLE #11' and names like 'Deborah Gail Stone'. These frames exhibit the man in the blue shirt, often associated with the bear painting, amidst diverse settings like a park, an indoor public space with an eagle figure, and a large building reminiscent of a theme park. The images also feature blurred backgrounds and explicit content warnings, contributing to a whimsical or comedic tone. One frame includes a collage of faces, while others capture a crowd event in the background, adding layers to the narrative visually presented in the video. The juxtaposition of different scenes and the recurring motifs of the man in the blue shirt and the bear painting underscore a consistent thematic thread throughout the video, enhanced by the diverse and dynamic visual elements represented in the key frames."},

  "CVResult": {
    "Judgment": "Yes",
    "Confidence": "95%",
    "Reason": "The provided information contains a detailed account of the incident involving Deborah Gail Stone, including the specifics of how she was crushed by a rotating wall at the America Sings attraction in Disneyland. The video transcript thoroughly explains the circumstances leading to her death, mentioning her backing up into a narrow passageway between a stationary wall and a rotating stage wall, and her subsequent screams for help that went unnoticed by guests who mistook them for part of the show. Moreover, it describes the aftermath of her death, including a lawsuit filed by her family against Disneyland, which they won, and the installation of safety lights as a safety measure after the incident. This comprehensive description corroborates the claim about Deborah Gail Stone's tragic death, providing a very high degree of reliability. However, the slight uncertainty in the details (no definitive account of her exact actions before being crushed) accounts for a 5% margin of doubt."
