It was sort of by accident really. I was an art major and just took traditional animation for the credits. In the class another student told me about a 3D animation class. So, I signed up and after the first class I was hooked. I knew this was what I had been searching for at school. I progressed through school and then professional work, using Maya and C4D mostly. I was always frustrated by their limitations when it came to FX.\nI had heard about Houdini and its capabilities, but its learning curve was so daunting. Finally the right job came in at my work. I needed to make this strange cloud world with these massive tornadoes, and I finally had enough lead time to experiment a little. I downloaded Houdini and went for it. After about a week I was in love. I haven’t stopped using it since.\n!(blob:https://www.rebelway.net/bf5f9c7517687df7c8b66729287d9254)\nWhat do you currently do for work?\n----------------------------------\nI am an Art Director at Possible Productions. I do a huge range of things from live events to broadcast, concert visuals, architectural installations and most recently XR/AR virtual production.\nHow is the process of approaching live-event FX different from a ‘typical’ project designed for screens?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe biggest difference in live events is scale. The large scale LED or projection surfaces we build for have native resolutions that are often over 10K. The cloud world I first experimented with Houdini on, for example, had a delivery raster that was 60K. And our lead times are typically measured in weeks, not months or years. So we have to be efficient with how we approach everything in the scene, from geometry to lighting to FX.\nStill, I can work within Houdini and set up my shots, or usually loops, in a very traditional vfx pipeline when it comes to live event screen content like concerts or installations. It just depends on what the project needs. With live virtual production events however, it requires many more steps to get from Houdini to a finished product within a real-time rendering engine like Unreal. And now we’re also optimizing for frame rate.\n!(blob:https://www.rebelway.net/f145937391ce1a64fd62bd6cdabf46c...[Content truncated]",

Special effects artists can control the weather, build and bring to life gruesome monsters, construct stunning pyrotechnic displays, create convincing wounds, or even manipulate the audience's perception in more fundamental ways—making them believe something small is large, for example. The art of special effects spans multiple industries and a world of approaches, from the practical effects artists of Hollywood to the theatrical effects artists of the stage, the pyrotechnics specialists who commonly work on music tours and concerts, and the many shades of grey between.\nTheatrical special effects artists are an integral part of the Broadway and West End ecosystems, and active participants in the collaborative process that is core to these high-profile, big-budget shows. Their work typically begins very early in the production process, when the show's director, technical director, and lead designers meet to discuss the production design, address any major interdepartmental concerns, and coordinate the timeline. From there, special effects artists begin the iterative process of designing, prototyping, and testing effects. Throughout, they liaise with the other design departments to ensure that everyone's on the same page: using pyrotechnics may require fireproofed costumes, for example, while the...[Content truncated]",

And it’s easily deployed to PCs, data centers or in the cloud.\nVirtual collaboration continues to grow with 70 million hours of web meetings daily, and more global organizations are looking at technologies to support an increasingly remote workforce.\nPexip, a scalable video conferencing platform that enables interoperability between different video conferencing systems, was looking to push the boundaries of its video communications offering to meet this growing demand.\n“We’re already using NVIDIA Maxine for audio noise removal and working on integrating virtual backgrounds to support premium video conferencing experiences for enterprises of all sizes,” said Giles Chamberlin, CTO and co-founder of Pexip.\nWorking with NVIDIA, Pexip aims to provide AI-powered video communications that support virtual meetings that are better than meetings in person.\nIt joins other companies in the video collaboration space like Avaya, which incorporated Maxine audio noise reduction into its Spaces app last October and has now implemented virtual background, which allows presenters to overlay their video over presentations.\nHeadroom uses AI to take distractions out of video conferencing, so participants can focus on interactions during meetings instead....[Content truncated]",
