AR Tool\nOne of the most successful examples of an AR system is zSpace® \\\\]. In 2015, zSpace® Inc. released the all-in-one solution for education consisting of a virtual reality monitor and computer. The system provides students with a realistic learning environment that is aligned with the next generation science standards (NGSS), common core, and state standards. The virtual-holographic images can be lifted from the screen and manipulated with the accompanying stylus. The solution allows for group interaction, as participants only need 3D glasses, as opposed to VR headsets \\\\].\nThe zSpace® system uses a 1920 × 1080 pixel LCD screen, and the hardware switches between the left and right images through a circularly polarized light that enters the eye. The glasses contain small reflective tabs that the computer uses to track where users are looking. This software prevents nausea and headaches by keeping the image focused.\nzSpace® combines elements of AR and VR to create lifelike experiences that are immersive and interactive. The system lets the students dissect animals and organs, manipulate compounds and structures in 3D, and run experiments without the need for costly lab equipment and supplies.\nzSpace® was chosen as the AR tool for STEM education () at the 134 Dimcho Debelianov School in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 2018 \\,\\]).\n#### 2.2. AR Tool Application\nzSpace® consists of several learning and simulation applications. Some of them are: zSpace® Studio—a collection of models from various subject areas and a set of pre-made activities, available in different languages; Newton’s Park—a physics simulation environment, promoting discovery through experimentation and allowing data gathering and analysis; Human Anatomy Atlas—for independent student research on the human body, allowing self-assessment of learning at the same time.\nThe key factors in choosing the solution were:\n*   Scope—the technology can be used in many subjects and can address different problems;\n*   Collaboration—the possibility for working in small groups of 2 or 3 students; the technology itself encourages teamwork;\n*   Experimentation—opportunities to perform scientific procedures;\n*   Creativity—creativity is encouraged, and they can let their imaginations run riot and take risks without fear of failure;\n*   Critical thinking and evaluation—the technology supports complex problem solving and evaluative thinking, helping them to analyse and understand abstract concepts better.\n#### 2.3.

AR Tool\nOne of the most successful examples of an AR system is zSpace® \\\\]. In 2015, zSpace® Inc. released the all-in-one solution for education consisting of a virtual reality monitor and computer. The system provides students with a realistic learning environment that is aligned with the next generation science standards (NGSS), common core, and state standards. The virtual-holographic images can be lifted from the screen and manipulated with the accompanying stylus. The solution allows for group interaction, as participants only need 3D glasses, as opposed to VR headsets \\\\].\nThe zSpace® system uses a 1920 × 1080 pixel LCD screen, and the hardware switches between the left and right images through a circularly polarized light that enters the eye. The glasses contain small reflective tabs that the computer uses to track where users are looking. This software prevents nausea and headaches by keeping the image focused.\nzSpace® combines elements of AR and VR to create lifelike experiences that are immersive and interactive. The system lets the students dissect animals and organs, manipulate compounds and structures in 3D, and run experiments without the need for costly lab equipment and supplies.\nzSpace® was chosen as the AR tool for STEM education () at the 134 Dimcho Debelianov School in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 2018 \\,\\]).\n#### 2.2. AR Tool Application\nzSpace® consists of several learning and simulation applications. Some of them are: zSpace® Studio—a collection of models from various subject areas and a set of pre-made activities, available in different languages; Newton’s Park—a physics simulation environment, promoting discovery through experimentation and allowing data gathering and analysis; Human Anatomy Atlas—for independent student research on the human body, allowing self-assessment of learning at the same time.\nThe key factors in choosing the solution were:\n*   Scope—the technology can be used in many subjects and can address different problems;\n*   Collaboration—the possibility for working in small groups of 2 or 3 students; the technology itself encourages teamwork;\n*   Experimentation—opportunities to perform scientific procedures;\n*   Creativity—creativity is encouraged, and they can let their imaginations run riot and take risks without fear of failure;\n*   Critical thinking and evaluation—the technology supports complex problem solving and evaluative thinking, helping them to analyse and understand abstract concepts better.\n#### 2.3. Evaluation\nSome recent studies focused on the relationship between augmented reality and STEM education and its potential. The effectiveness...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What technology was used to create the visual effects seen in the gymnasium video featuring the whale?",
        "Answer": "The visual effects seen in the gymnasium video featuring the whale were created using augmented reality (AR) technology. Here are the key reasons supporting this conclusion:\n\n1. **Nature of Augmented Reality**: The video is recognized as an example of augmented reality, which enhances the real-world environment with computer-generated visual elements. AR uses various devices, such as smartphones or tablets, to overlay digital content onto the physical world, creating interactive experiences without the need for specialized holographic displays. This is distinct from traditional holography, which relies on projecting light to create three-dimensional images. Thus, the whale's appearance in the video was realized through AR rather than a legitimate hologram [Query 2_evidence_1].\n\n2. **Market Understanding of AR**: The rise of AR in educational and exhibition settings has highlighted its capabilities to create visually engaging experiences. In many instances, AR has been successfully implemented in museums and schools, providing interactive and immersive ways to engage audiences. The technology allows for the addition of visual effects to existing environments, enhancing realism and interactivity in presentations. This contextual understanding aligns with the kind of impressive visual display seen in the video [Query 1_evidence_1].\n\n3. **Examples of AR Applications**: Specifically, there are detailed cases where AR applications have been used effectively in educational contexts, demonstrating how layered digital content can create engaging learning environments. Such systems allow users to interact with and manipulate 3D representations of various subjects, which capsulates the experience viewers had with the whale in the gymnasium setting—where students presumably witnessed an animated whale breaching in an otherwise familiar reality [Query 1_evidence_2].\n\nIn conclusion, the technology that produced the visual effects in the gymnasium video is augmented reality, leveraging interactive digital overlays that create engaging visual spectacles, rather than validated '7D holograms.'",
