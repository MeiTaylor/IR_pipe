AR Tool\nOne of the most successful examples of an AR system is zSpace® \\\\]. In 2015, zSpace® Inc. released the all-in-one solution for education consisting of a virtual reality monitor and computer. The system provides students with a realistic learning environment that is aligned with the next generation science standards (NGSS), common core, and state standards. The virtual-holographic images can be lifted from the screen and manipulated with the accompanying stylus. The solution allows for group interaction, as participants only need 3D glasses, as opposed to VR headsets \\\\].\nThe zSpace® system uses a 1920 × 1080 pixel LCD screen, and the hardware switches between the left and right images through a circularly polarized light that enters the eye. The glasses contain small reflective tabs that the computer uses to track where users are looking. This software prevents nausea and headaches by keeping the image focused.\nzSpace® combines elements of AR and VR to create lifelike experiences that are immersive and interactive. The system lets the students dissect animals and organs, manipulate compounds and structures in 3D, and run experiments without the need for costly lab equipment and supplies.\nzSpace® was chosen as the AR tool for STEM education () at the 134 Dimcho Debelianov School in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 2018 \\,\\]).\n#### 2.2. AR Tool Application\nzSpace® consists of several learning and simulation applications. Some of them are: zSpace® Studio—a collection of models from various subject areas and a set of pre-made activities, available in different languages; Newton’s Park—a physics simulation environment, promoting discovery through experimentation and allowing data gathering and analysis; Human Anatomy Atlas—for independent student research on the human body, allowing self-assessment of learning at the same time.\nThe key factors in choosing the solution were:\n*   Scope—the technology can be used in many subjects and can address different problems;\n*   Collaboration—the possibility for working in small groups of 2 or 3 students; the technology itself encourages teamwork;\n*   Experimentation—opportunities to perform scientific procedures;\n*   Creativity—creativity is encouraged, and they can let their imaginations run riot and take risks without fear of failure;\n*   Critical thinking and evaluation—the technology supports complex problem solving and evaluative thinking, helping them to analyse and understand abstract concepts better.\n#### 2.3. Evaluation\nSome recent studies focused on the relationship between augmented reality and STEM education and its potential. The effectiveness...[Content truncated]",

Now with over 1 billion (with a “B”!) people using Augmented Reality (AR) globally each month, this area of the event tech space has likely been brought up as a tool to enhance your guest experiences.  \n\nThe variety of approaches to utilizing AR, and other XR (“Extended Reality”, an all encompassing term for Augmented Reality & Virtual Reality technologies) for live events can be overwhelming. This makes it difficult for event producers to determine what is feasible to create on event budgets and timelines as well as how to craft an experience attendees will actually love using.\n\nSo, this begs the question: How do you incorporate Augmented Reality successfully into your events?    \n\nHere we’ll outline 5 immersive AR ideas you can actually use at your events, focussing on concepts that are both approachable and entertaining for your audience. \n‍\n‍\n‍\nPhysical 2D art murals at your venue can be brought to life in 3D through Instagram’s built in Augmented Reality functionality.\n‍\n\nHow do Instagram AR Murals work?  First, you partner with an (often local) artist to install a physical art piece in your venue.  \n\nNext, an Augmented Reality experience that will be triggered by the artwork is created, optimized for use on Instagram.  This experience can include 3D objects, custom animation & sound effects, as well as responsive interactivity to human movement or the physical environment.  \n‍\n‍\nFinally, a custom QR code is displayed near the artwork. When guests point their smartphone camera at this code, the AR experience automatically opens inside Instagram’s “Stories” capture mode. Guests then point their camera at the AR Mural, allowing them to experience the art in an immersive Extended Reality environment that they can immediately capture and share to their Instagram Story.\n‍\nWhile the creative possibilities are “endless”, some practical ideas for the digital AR experiences include creating fantastical worlds of geometric shapes & color, scenic...[Content truncated]",

Schlieski says, \"When you see that, you're like, 'That's gonna be a problem!' I thought they might get distracted, loud, noisy, fidgety. But they didn't. They were riveted. They sat, literally on the edge of their seats, and joined in with the standing ovation after. I was so encouraged.\"\nKey to producing that kind of response in audiences is the motion-capture suit, provided by Imaginarium and worn by actor Mark Quartley. The suit monitors his movements and they in turn dictate the movement of Ariel as he is projected on to the screen. During a long training process, Quartley figured out how to make the sprite fly, plead, terrify, torment, and, as Schlieski puts it, \"split apart into all these little shapes, and he's singing, and I think in that moment the avatar really helps capture the unbound joy that Ariel is expressing.\" The techniques are already winning acclaim from critics in the British press for tech's ability to turn Shakespeare's plays into a new kind of spectacle.\nThe play — widely believed to be the last that Shakespeare wrote alone — is itself the tale of an elderly man named Prospero's struggle to secure the life prospects of his daughter, Miranda — to secure his legacy. It seems absurd to suggest that we might abandon all interest in Shakespeare if the people charged with putting on his work don't keep up-to-date with the latest technological advancements; his popularity does not depend utterly on a motion-capture suit.\n\"Shakespeare possessed a remarkable imagination that was really grounded in human experience,\" explains Schlieski. \"At its core, The Tempest is about a man getting older, facing his own mortality, and thinking about what he wants for his daughter. What is his relationship with the people he has been in conflict with throughout his life? I think that's not a story which is particularly bound to an Elizabethan timeframe – it's something we all have to master as we approach the sunset, and figure out: What is the legacy that we want to leave behind?\"\nThis content was paid for by...[Content truncated]",

Ed.D.'09; and former postdoctoral associate Matt Dunleavy — leveraged the power and panache of handheld technologies to enhance middle schoolers' engagement in learning. For under-resourced schools, it also holds promise for addressing equity concerns when it comes to technology-based learning.\nDede has been studying immersive technology and issues at the juncture of science, education, and technology for more than three decades, working with students from public schools, the military, higher education, and the corporate world. O'Shea's doctorate is in urban studies, with an educational technology focus. Collaborating with colleagues from  and the , the two are completing analysis of a learning exercise they designed to use augmented reality (AR) — real world activities with a superimposed virtual simulation — as an instructional tool both to build middle-schoolers' math and language arts skills and to spark excitement about learning.\n\"Most kids at this age tend to become disengaged from learning,\" Dede said. \"Technology gives us a way to recapture their attention. Also, many of them think academic subjects are abstract and have little to do with the world around them. Giving them an assignment that takes them out in their own neighborhoods immediately establishes the relevance of their task.\"\nThe team developed two exercises for the purpose of formative evaluation. _Alien Contact!_, the first exercise, took place during the 2006-2007 academic year and involved students and teachers from two middle schools and one high school in the Boston area. Outfitted with cell phones and GPS-enabled, handheld computers, students at each school were directed to nearby locations to interview virtual characters and inspect digital items related to a mysterious alien invasion. Working through math and literacy problems enabled students to determine why the aliens had landed. Using the same technology, but incorporating lessons learned from _Alien Contact!_, the team tested a second curriculum in 2008. _Gray Anatomy_ asked participants to solve the mystery of why a gray whale had beached itself nearby. In both exercises, students worked in groups, and each student in the group was assigned a unique role and received different clues or questions to answer. Assembling the pieces of the puzzle required not just factual knowledge, but also effective communication and collaboration.\n### Learning from Aliens\n\"In terms of designing an augmented reality curriculum,\" said O'Shea, \"we were learning by doing. When you don't have a blueprint, some things work well, but you also get a few surprises.\" One unintended outcome in _Alien Contact!_ was the extent to which the groups viewed the exercise as a...[Content truncated]",

The use of augmented reality (AR) technology, as one form of digital technology, is increasingly embedded in digital applications because it allows individuals to interact with real and virtual objects. A significant body of research has reported the benefits afforded by the use of AR technology in schools and higher education settings. However, little is known about the contribution of AR technology to teaching practice and child learning outcomes in the preschool years. Here, we present a summary of the limited research that has explored the use of AR in preschool curricula and argue for the need for further research to explore the contribution of AR to high-quality pedagogical practice.\nGet full access to this article\n-------------------------------\nView all access and purchase options for this article.\nReferences\n----------\nAkçayır M., Akçayır G.

But that’s quickly changing.\nWhen it comes to museums and technology, resistance to using change might make sense, on some level: preserving history and culture is often the imperative. Yet, when wielded well, certain technologies enhance the telling of history, culture, art, and science in highly compelling ways.\nAugmented reality, or AR, is one technology that’s beginning to receive a lot of attention in the museum world. More and more, curators and creators are finding creative ways to use AR for museums to tell their stories and offer highly memorable experiences to visitors.\nFor a lot of curators and museum marketers, however, a sheepish question or two surfaces:\n_**What exactly is augmented reality? And how can museums really benefit from AR?**_\nUnlike virtual reality (VR), which replicates an entirely virtual world within a headset, the focus in augmented reality is on the first word: _augmented_. AR uses a headset, special glasses, a smartphone, or a tablet to add visuals to the existing world we can see.\nIn a museum setting, this might mean adding effects to paintings, bringing historical scenes to life, gamifying exhibits, layering kid-friendly experiences onto adult exhibits, and more.\n> _“Far from acting as a distraction, technology can be used to bring people closer to the artefacts and history a museum exhibit is exploring.”_  - ****\nHere are ten exceptional examples of augmented reality exhibitions to both inform and, hopefully, inspire you.\n### 1\\.
