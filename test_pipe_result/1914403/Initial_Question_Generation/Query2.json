They add other effects and call them dimensions like smell, sound, wind, motion, water, bubbles, light and fog effects.\nSo, 7D holograms do not exist effectively and basically are just 2D or 3D movies with added effects.\nYes, we can see them in 3D if the movie is projected on a 3D screen and we are wearing 3D glasses.

Soul consciousness. Your awareness has expanded to the point you know who you really are. As you align with the soul, you manifest very quickly sometimes within a few minutes to a day. You manifest your reality fast! At this point you don’t care about manifesting. It’s something to do in this 3D world, and that’s it.

Practically every sci-fi movie and TV show from the last 50 years has some version of this futuristic technology. A realistic 3D object composed of nothing more than light, usually hovering over a table or interacting with our heroes, just screams \"This is the future!\" \nAfter countless disappointing versions of the technology, a startup called Light Field Lab has started production on a technology it calls SolidLight, which is designed to produce real-life holograms. The promise is basically Star Trek's holodeck, minus the tactility and murderous Moriartys (hopefully). Here's how it works.\nMaybe you're thinking \"Big deal, I've seen holograms for years!\" Well, yes and no. The vast majority of visual effects called \"holograms\" are nothing of the sort. For instance, if you've ever experienced the Haunted Mansion ride at a Disney park, the dancing ghosts are neither real ghosts (sorry, spoiler), nor are they holograms. They use a technique called \"Pepper's ghost\" which dates back to the early 1800's. This is also how Tupac performed \"live\" on stage 16 years after his...[Content truncated]",

D.Y.Patil ACS college,Pimpri, pune.       \n> Abstract: The significant development of 7D Holograplic technology,its potential to revolutionize aspect of teaching a learning,Entartainment and challenge of implanting the technology in education setting.Holography is the science of making holograms which are usually intended for displaying seven dimensional images. It is a physical structure that diffracts light into an image. A holographic image can be seen looking into an illuminated holographic print by shining a laser through a hologram and projecting a image on the screen.7D Holographic technology overcome the barrier of entertainment word. Based concept of 7D technology little but same but some more scope.The paper reviews the basic concepts of holography, discussing in depth of the principle of interference on which it is based, and outlines the broad applications of holography. We finally present a short conclusion in the end after analyzing the various aspects of holography.

INTRODUCTION Gabor, who imagined holography in 1947, presented the term utilizing two Greek words: \"Holos\" - entire and \"Graphe\" -composing. It basically implies that the recorded holographic picture of the item contains entire optical data about the object \n– Amplitude and Phase data of the light scattered from the item. Preferably, the visualization is a three-dimensional picture replicated from impedance design recorded by intelligible light beans and holography is a procedure of remaking and composing a multi dimensional image. White light from the sun or a light is a blend of each shade of light in the range, which is not valuable for a multi dimensional image. In any case, a laser sparkles light in a dainty, exceptional shaft which is of one shading which suggests that they are uniform and in-stage. At the point when two laser shafts cooperate, a solitary new wave example is delivered: the multi dimensional image. Customarily, holography was typically static and the application constrained to shows, yet with improvement in this science, it is utilized as a part of different field of applications, including workmanship, security, information stockpiling et II.

When illuminated via a laser, holograms are able to form an exact 3D clone of the object and duplicate its features.\nIn order to produce an accurate visualization of a hologram at a certain point in space, two light waves must be coordinated in motion - a reference wave and an object wave. Both are formed by separating the laser beam.\nThe reference wave is created directly by the light source, and the object wave is reflected from the recorded object. There is also a photographic plate on which dark stripes are \"imprinted\" depending on the distribution of electromagnetic energy (interference) in a given place.\nA similar process takes place on ordinary photographic film. However, to reproduce an image from it, a printout on photographic paper is required. However, during the active use of hologram technology, everything happens a little differently.\nTo reproduce a \"portrait\", the photographic plate has to be \"illuminated\" with another light wave in close proximity to the reference wave, which converts both waves into a new wave of light that runs alongside the object wave. The result is an almost entirely accurate reflection of the object itself. For a better understanding of **how holograms are produced**, watch this short .\nWhat are some of the most common industry use cases?\n----------------------------------------------------\n**Holographic technology** is used in a variety of ways, across several industries. The list below includes some of the most popularized examples:\n### **1\\. Telecommunications**\nIn 2017, Verizon (USA) and Korea Telecom (South Korea) made the first holographic call using 5G technology. To make the call possible, two holograms were formed. Both fully capable of conveying the user's emotions and gestures.\n### **2\\. Education**\nIn 2015, the Nobel laureate and professor of physics at Stanford University, Karl Wieman, spoke at Nanyang Technological University (Singapore) without leaving the United States.  \nIn 2013, St George's University of London introduced **holograms** capable of displaying the working organs of a human body. The presentation showcased three-dimensional images of kidneys four meters in length, a skull, and other parts of the body.\n### **3\\.** **Spatial navigation**\nIn 2017, scientists...[Content truncated]",
