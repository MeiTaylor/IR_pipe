It is simply meant to get the attention of the soon-to-be-perplexed. All marketing, little to no substance.\nEach dimension is a way of seeing or sensing something.\n1D (one dimensional) is mostly a theoretical idea or the domain of the very small world of quantum mechanics. Everything we can see has 2 dimensions. Even a very very thin long line has at least some width.\n2D a flat representation of a scene or object. its size can be described as height and width. Like a square, picture or image on a standard TV.\n3D a recreation of an object or scene in three dimensions. So height, width and depth like a cube or sphere. We have two eyes so we have great depth perception and experience the world in 3D\n4D is basically 3D plus movement over time. So Time is the fourth dimension\n5D and above are not viewable or detectable by us in our Universe. These extra dimensions are the playground of fiction authors and theoretical physicists.\nString theory predicts our block of 4 dimensions are only a small group of a much larger group of dimensions. This does not mean that there are perfectly formed replicas of the universe we can detect with alternate versions of us and different histories played out. If there are multiple dimensions outside of our own and we could never interact with them in any way then they might as well be not there as far as we are concerned on a daily basis....[Content truncated]",

It is simply meant to get the attention of the soon-to-be-perplexed. All marketing, little to no substance.\nEach dimension is a way of seeing or sensing something.\n1D (one dimensional) is mostly a theoretical idea or the domain of the very small world of quantum mechanics. Everything we can see has 2 dimensions. Even a very very thin long line has at least some width.\n2D a flat representation of a scene or object. its size can be described as height and width. Like a square, picture or image on a standard TV.\n3D a recreation of an object or scene in three dimensions. So height, width and depth like a cube or sphere. We have two eyes so we have great depth perception and experience the world in 3D\n4D is basically 3D plus movement over time. So Time is the fourth dimension\n5D and above are not viewable or detectable by us in our Universe. These extra dimensions are the playground of fiction authors and theoretical physicists.\nString theory predicts our block of 4 dimensions are only a small group of a much larger group of dimensions. This does not mean that there are perfectly formed replicas of the universe we can detect with alternate versions of us and different histories played out. If there are multiple dimensions outside of our own and we could never interact with them in any way then they might as well be not there as far as we are concerned on a daily basis....[Content truncated]"

    "QA": {
        "Question": "Does the video provide credible evidence for a '7D Hologram' whale in a gymnasium?",
        "Answer": "The video claiming to show a \"7D Hologram\" of a whale in a gymnasium does not provide credible evidence to support this assertion. Here are the reasons:\n\n1. **Misleading Terminology**: The term \"7D Hologram\" is often used in a marketing context with little to no scientific validity. As noted in evidence, it is generally considered a marketing ploy rather than a description of a legitimate technological advancement in holography [Query 1_evidence1]. This suggests that the concept of a \"7D Hologram\" may be exaggerated or not scientifically grounded.\n\n2. **Nature of the Display**: The viral video of the whale appearing in the gymnasium was identified as an example of augmented reality (AR), not a true hologram. The source explains that the perception of a whale breaching was achieved through augmented reality technology, which utilizes visual effects to create a convincing illusion, rather than projecting a hologram [Query 2_evidence_1]. This distinction indicates that the visual spectacle in the video is based on AR rather than holograms.\n\n3. **Clarifications on \"Dimensions\"**: The understanding of what constitutes a \"7D\" effect is clarified in the evidence, indicating that many so-called \"higher-dimensional\" experiences simply layer additional sensory effects (like sound, smell, and wind) onto 3D visuals. These are not additional spatial dimensions but rather enhancements that add to the immersive experience; thus, what is labeled as \"7D\" is often just an elaboration of 3D displays with added effects [Query 2_evidence_2].\n\nTaking these points into consideration, the video presents an intriguing scenario but ultimately lacks credible evidence for an actual \"7D Hologram\" whale display in a gymnasium.",
