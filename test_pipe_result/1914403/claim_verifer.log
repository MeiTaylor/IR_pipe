While the video content describes a dramatic scene of a whale emerging in a gymnasium, it does not explicitly confirm that this involves holographic technology or what '7D' specifically entails. The term '7D' is also not explained within the video information, leaving an ambiguity regarding what experience or technology is being represented. Without clear evidence regarding the use of holograms and what constitutes '7D', it is difficult to affirm the truthfulness of the original claim."

  "Task": "Determine if online information searching is needed to answer the new question. Consider the following criteria:

1. Online search is generally recommended for most questions to provide comprehensive and up-to-date information.
2. If the question can be fully and confidently answered using only the given 'Claim', 'Video_information', and 'QA_CONTEXTS', online search may not be necessary.
3. If the question specifically asks about details or content exclusively present in the video, online search may not be needed.
4. For any question that could benefit from additional context, background, or current information, online search is recommended.

Based on these criteria, determine if online search is needed (Yes or No). If online search could potentially provide any useful information or context, even if not strictly necessary, choose 'Yes'. Only choose 'No' if the question is entirely about specific video content that cannot be found online.

If the result is 'Yes', generate two new queries for Google Custom Search API. If 'No', do not provide any queries.

If generating queries:
- Ensure Query 1 and Query 2 focus on different aspects of the question and are not repetitive.
- Each query should be concise (not exceeding 10 words) and suitable for Google Custom Search API.
- Provide key terms that represent the core focus of each specific query. Key terms must be a single word.

Note: The generated queries should be phrases suitable for Google Search.

2024-08-01 19:39:20 - ThreadPoolExecutor-0_0 - INFO - Here's an evaluation of the listed websites in terms of credibility, reliability, and potential for detecting fake news:

1. **www.reddit.com**  
   **Score: 6/10**  
   **Explanation:** Reddit is a user-driven platform where individuals can share opinions, links, and information on a vast range of topics. While some subreddits may offer helpful and factual information, the overall quality varies significantly due to the open nature of contributions. There are sections dedicated to fact-checking and credible discussions, but misinformation can proliferate easily. Therefore, it is a moderate score reflecting its mixed reliability.

2. **athis-technologies.com**  
   **Score: 4/10**  
   **Explanation:** This website appears to focus on technology solutions, but without further context on its content, history, and authority in fact-checking or news accuracy, it is difficult to ascertain its reliability. If it specializes in marketing or products rather than factual reporting or technology analysis, it may not be the best source for determining truthfulness.

3. **www.alibaba.com**  
   **Score: 5/10**  
   **Explanation:** Alibaba is an e-commerce platform primarily focused on facilitating trade between businesses and consumers. While it is reputable in the business sector, its focus is not on news, fact-checking, or general information verification, thus limiting its utility in evaluating claims like the one presented. 

4. **www.quora.com**  
   **Score: 6/10**  
   **Explanation:** Quora allows users to ask questions and receive answers from the community. Many responses are knowledgeable and informative, but since answers can vary in accuracy greatly, particularly in topics involving opinions or conjecture, the credibility of information may be questionable. Overall, it can provide useful insights but lacks stringent factual verification.

5. **www.japan-guide.com**  
   **Score: 8/10**  
   **Explanation:** Japan-Guide is a well-regarded site for travel information and guidance regarding Japan. It is structured and provides accurate resources, making it fairly reliable for factual content about specific topics such as cultural events, travel tips, and geography. While it may not directly verify claims like the one regarding the hologram, it can provide context about technology and cultural phenomena in Japan.

6. **simplicable.com**  
   **Score: 7/10**  
   **Explanation:** Simplicable is known for providing clear, well-organized content on various topics, including business, technology, and social issues. The site aims to educate users with concise articles and explanations. It has potential as a resource for understanding topics but may not be a dedicated source for refuting fake news.

7. **www.researchgate.net**  
   **Score: 9/10**  
   **Explanation:** ResearchGate is a reputable network for researchers and academics to share papers, articles, and findings. The content on ResearchGate is often peer-reviewed or supported by academic literature, making it a solid resource for credibility. It can be an excellent tool for verifying scientific claims and studies relevant to technology and phenomena like holograms.

8. **ijritcc.org**  
   **Score: 7/10**  
   **Explanation:** The International Journal of Research in Information Technology and Computing is a scholarly resource that publishes articles relevant to information technology and computer science. While it may not cover contemporary news or immediate fact-checking, it is a credible source for reliable studies and information within its field.

9. **moviepower.en.made-in-china.com**  
   **Score: 4/10**  
   **Explanation:** This site appears to be a marketplace for film and related products. Its reliability for fact-checking or addressing claims of technological achievements is low because it mainly serves commercial purposes. As such, it does not hold significant value in terms of verifying the truthfulness of news.

10. **www.linkedin.com**  
   **Score: 7/10**  
   **Explanation:** LinkedIn is primarily a professional networking site, but it also features articles and discussions on various professional subjects. Its reliance on user-generated content means that the accuracy can vary, yet it does have credible professionals who share insights. It may offer valuable perspectives but less systematic fact-checking.

**Summary of Quality Scores:**

- www.reddit.com: 6/10
- athis-technologies.com: 4/10
- www.alibaba.com: 5/10
- www.quora.com: 6/10
- www.japan-guide.com: 8/10
- simplicable.com: 7/10
- www.researchgate.net: 9/10
- ijritcc.org: 7/10
- moviepower.en.made-in-china.com: 4/10
- www.linkedin.com: 7/10

In conclusion, for evaluating the claim about the "7D Hologram of a whale," websites like ResearchGate and Japan-Guide are more likely to provide credible and factual analysis. In contrast, platforms like Reddit and Quora can yield a variety of perspectives but must be approached with caution regarding truthfulness.

The universe exists in 3D space with time often considered a fourth dimension. The reason that a 7D hologram has so many dimensions is that the hologram is captured from a large number of positions that surround the scene or subject of the hologram. Each position is described in 3D space. Each position captures a variety of viewing directions in 2D space. Two additional parameters are captured for each direction: image intensity and time. If you add these up you get 7 parameters, known as dimensions\\nBy\\n\\\\-\\n6 years ago\\n1344\\n(whatsapp://send?text=7Dhologramtechnology%0A%0Ahttps://athis-technologies.com/news/consumer-tech/2018/7d-hologram-technology/)\\n#### \\n!]\\n### \\n!]\\n### \\n!]\\n### \\n!]\\n### \\n!]\\n### \\n(whatsapp://send?text=7Dhologramtechnology%0A%0Ahttps://athis-technologies.com/news/consumer-tech/2018/7d-hologram-technology/)\\n]\\n##### \\nOperation Manager at  | \\nAs an Expert in IT & AI, Mickael brings fresh news about Emerging, Wearable Techs, and IT Innovation.

Basics of Holography \\nA 3D image is a recording in an a few dimensional medium of the obstruction design shaped when a point wellspring of light (the reference pillar) of altered wavelength experiences light of the same settled wavelength touching base from an article (the item beam).Ordinary light is comprised of a wide range of wavelengths,none of which keeps up an altered stage association with one another or with themselves over atimeframe. It has poor worldly soundness. Such incomprehensible light is not equipped for meddling with itself, which is the most essential for the use of holography. So lasers are utilized to deliver light pillars which are reasonable more than 10^10 wavelengths and that's only the tip of the iceberg. \\n\u2022 Interference: It is a marvel in which two waves superpose to \\nframe a resultant flood of more noteworthy or lower plentifulness. Obstruction as a rule alludes to the waves that are lucid with one another. \\n\u2022 Diffraction grindi ng: The recorded light example Is diffraction grinding. When it is lit up by one and only of the waves used to make it, it can be demonstrated that one of the diffracted waves develops at the same edge at which the second wave was initially episode so that the second wave has been reproduced. Along these lines the recorded light example is a holographic recording. \\n\u2022 Photographic plate: Only records the intensities. \\n\u2022 Interference Pattern: Contains the sta \\nB.

2024-08-01 19:39:53 - ThreadPoolExecutor-0_0 - INFO - Here is the evaluation of the relevance of each piece of evidence to the question "Does the video provide credible evidence for a '7D Hologram' whale in a gymnasium?"

### Evidence 0
- **RelevanceScore**: 3
- **Justification**: This evidence discusses 7D hologram technology but does not provide any verifiable specifics regarding its existence or practical application in a school gymnasium setting. It remains vague and lacks direct correlation to the claim in question.

### Evidence 1
- **RelevanceScore**: 5
- **Justification**: This evidence offers a broad understanding of 7D holograms, explaining some technological aspects. However, it fails to address the actual display of a 7D hologram whale in a gymnasium context, making it moderately relevant but not definitively convincing regarding the claim.

### Evidence 2
- **RelevanceScore**: 4
- **Justification**: The excerpt outlines advancements in 7D hologram technology but does not delve into specifics that could confirm or debunk the claim about a whale hologram in a gymnasium. It provides relevant information but lacks a direct connection to a verifiable instance.

### Evidence 3
- **RelevanceScore**: 6
- **Justification**: This evidence states that 7D holograms don't contain multiple spatial dimensions but instead utilize additional sensory effects, which could imply that the term "7D" might not be a marker of authenticity in the claim shown in the video. This offers valuable insight into the credibility of the claim.

### Evidence 4
- **RelevanceScore**: 2
- **Justification**: This evidence mentions a 7D hologram museum but does not provide information that enables the evaluation of the claim about the whale hologram in a gymnasium. It is irrelevant to establishing the veracity of the claim.

### Evidence 5
- **RelevanceScore**: 7
- **Justification**: This source explains the concept of 7D holograms and elucidates that they are constructed with a variety of effects to create the illusion of depth. This information could be crucial for dissecting the video's claim as it suggests the technology may be more about illusion than genuine holography.

### Evidence 6
- **RelevanceScore**: 4
- **Justification**: While this evidence provides technical details about 7D holography, it does not sufficiently relate to the specific instance of a whale hologram within a gymnasium. The evidence offers some relevant technical context but is limited in its applicability to evaluating the claim.

### Evidence 7
- **RelevanceScore**: 3
- **Justification**: This source outlines basic holographic principles but does not provide enough information that ties directly to the claim regarding a whale hologram or the feasibility of such a projection in a gymnasium setting.

### Evidence 8
- **RelevanceScore**: 2
- **Justification**: Deals with general interactive gaming systems that use holographic technology but does not touch directly on the claim about the whale hologram. This makes it mostly irrelevant in assessing the specific claim.

### Evidence 9
- **RelevanceScore**: 8
- **Justification**: This evidence critiques the term "7D" in holography as a marketing term rather than a measure of reality. It convincingly undermines the claim by suggesting it lacks credible grounding in technology, which is pivotal for determining the veracity of the claim about the whale hologram.

In summary, the scores reflect how each piece of evidence engages with the main inquiry into the credulity of the video depicting a "7D Hologram" whale.

INTRODUCTION Gabor, who imagined holography in 1947, presented the term utilizing two Greek words: \\\"Holos\\\" - entire and \\\"Graphe\\\" -composing. It basically implies that the recorded holographic picture of the item contains entire optical data about the object \\n\u2013 Amplitude and Phase data of the light scattered from the item. Preferably, the visualization is a three-dimensional picture replicated from impedance design recorded by intelligible light beans and holography is a procedure of remaking and composing a multi dimensional image. White light from the sun or a light is a blend of each shade of light in the range, which is not valuable for a multi dimensional image. In any case, a laser sparkles light in a dainty, exceptional shaft which is of one shading which suggests that they are uniform and in-stage. At the point when two laser shafts cooperate, a solitary new wave example is delivered: the multi dimensional image. Customarily, holography was typically static and the application constrained to shows, yet with improvement in this science, it is utilized as a part of different field of applications, including workmanship, security, information stockpiling et II.

When illuminated via a laser, holograms are able to form an exact 3D clone of the object and duplicate its features.\\nIn order to produce an accurate visualization of a hologram at a certain point in space, two light waves must be coordinated in motion - a reference wave and an object wave. Both are formed by separating the laser beam.\\nThe reference wave is created directly by the light source, and the object wave is reflected from the recorded object. There is also a photographic plate on which dark stripes are \\\"imprinted\\\" depending on the distribution of electromagnetic energy (interference) in a given place.\\nA similar process takes place on ordinary photographic film. However, to reproduce an image from it, a printout on photographic paper is required. However, during the active use of hologram technology, everything happens a little differently.\\nTo reproduce a \\\"portrait\\\", the photographic plate has to be \\\"illuminated\\\" with another light wave in close proximity to the reference wave, which converts both waves into a new wave of light that runs alongside the object wave. The result is an almost entirely accurate reflection of the object itself. For a better understanding of **how holograms are produced**, watch this short .\\nWhat are some of the most common industry use cases?\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n**Holographic technology** is used in a variety of ways, across several industries. The list below includes some of the most popularized examples:\\n### **1\\\\. Telecommunications**\\nIn 2017, Verizon (USA) and Korea Telecom (South Korea) made the first holographic call using 5G technology. To make the call possible, two holograms were formed. Both fully capable of conveying the user's emotions and gestures.\\n### **2\\\\. Education**\\nIn 2015, the Nobel laureate and professor of physics at Stanford University, Karl Wieman, spoke at Nanyang Technological University (Singapore) without leaving the United States.  \\nIn 2013, St George's University of London introduced **holograms** capable of displaying the working organs of a human body. The presentation showcased three-dimensional images of kidneys four meters in length, a skull, and other parts of the body.\\n### **3\\\\.** **Spatial navigation**\\nIn 2017, scientists...[Content truncated]\"\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"evidence8\": {\n            \"title\": \"This Whale Isn't Real \u2014 It's Augmented Reality. - Business Insider\",\n            \"link\": \"https://www.businessinsider.com/incredible-augmented-reality-headset-2016-3\",\n            \"displayLink\": \"www.businessinsider.com\",\n            \"snippet\": \"Mar 2, 2016 ...

2024-08-01 19:44:40 - ThreadPoolExecutor-0_1 - INFO - Based on the evaluation of the provided evidence in relation to the question of whether the video provides credible evidence for a "7D Hologram" whale in a gymnasium, here are the scores and justifications:

1. **evidence0**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 9 
   - **Justification**: This evidence provides a clear explanation that "7D holograms" do not have seven spatial dimensions and are effectively just enhanced 2D or 3D displays with additional effects. This directly addresses the claim of a "7D Hologram" whale, suggesting that the concept is misleading and likely not credible.

2. **evidence1**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 4 
   - **Justification**: While it pertains to 7D holograms, the content's link does not provide substantial evidence or a clear understanding of whether 7D holograms are real or relevant to the claim made in the video. As such, it offers limited insight into the specific question.

3. **evidence2**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 8 
   - **Justification**: Similar to evidence0, this evidence asserts that 7D holograms do not mean additional spatial dimensions; it's mostly about interactive effects. This is relevant as it supports the notion that the claim about a "7D Hologram" may not hold up.

4. **evidence3**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 5 
   - **Justification**: This discussion of holograms discusses real advancements in technology, but it doesn't specifically address 7D holograms or the validity of the claim in the video. It’s tangentially related, limiting its relevance.

5. **evidence4**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 3 
   - **Justification**: This evidence refers to a forum post about a 7D hologram museum, not directly addressing whether the claim in the video is credible. Thus, it is not particularly relevant to the current question.

6. **evidence5**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 3 
   - **Justification**: This is a research paper reference that may have information on holographic technologies but does not specifically focus on 7D holograms or the claim made in the video, resulting in lower relevance.

7. **evidence6**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 6 
   - **Justification**: While it discusses holography technologies, it does not directly address the specifics of 7D holograms. However, it does touch upon the principles of holography, so it is somewhat relevant.

8. **evidence7**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 7 
   - **Justification**: This evidence provides a good overview of how holograms function in practice, lending some credence to discussions of holograms, although it does not address 7D specificities or provide critical insight into the whale claim.

9. **evidence8**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 10 
   - **Justification**: This evidence directly notes that the whale was not a 7D hologram but rather augmented reality from a tech startup, providing crucial and clear refutation of the claim in question, thus establishing its falsehood.

10. **evidence9**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 2 
   - **Justification**: This evidence references the use of holograms in entertainment but does not address the specific claims of the whale being a 7D hologram in the gymnasium context, making it minimally relevant.

Overall, this scoring provides a clearer understanding of how each piece of evidence contributes to determining the claim's truthfulness regarding the existence of a "7D Hologram" whale.

2024-08-01 19:45:20 - MainThread - INFO - **EvidenceIsUseful:**
- **Useful**: yes
- **Reason**: The evidence provided addresses the validity of the claim regarding the "7D Hologram" of a whale. It includes references to the nature of 7D holograms being more of a marketing term rather than a scientifically substantiated phenomenon, indicating that such holograms, particularly as described in the context of the video, do not exist in a meaningful way. Specifically, one piece of the evidence states that what is presented as a 7D hologram is likely just a conventional augmented reality effect and that there are no actual 7D holograms, which aligns with the skepticism surrounding the claim made in the video. Overall, the evidence helps clarify the misconceptions about the term "7D hologram" and reinforces that the visual effects seen in the video are not credible representations of a real holographic phenomenon.

2024-08-01 19:45:29 - MainThread - INFO - The video claiming to show a "7D Hologram" of a whale in a gymnasium does not provide credible evidence to support this assertion. Here are the reasons:

1. **Misleading Terminology**: The term "7D Hologram" is often used in a marketing context with little to no scientific validity. As noted in evidence, it is generally considered a marketing ploy rather than a description of a legitimate technological advancement in holography [Query 1_evidence1]. This suggests that the concept of a "7D Hologram" may be exaggerated or not scientifically grounded.

2. **Nature of the Display**: The viral video of the whale appearing in the gymnasium was identified as an example of augmented reality (AR), not a true hologram. The source explains that the perception of a whale breaching was achieved through augmented reality technology, which utilizes visual effects to create a convincing illusion, rather than projecting a hologram [Query 2_evidence_1]. This distinction indicates that the visual spectacle in the video is based on AR rather than holograms.

3. **Clarifications on "Dimensions"**: The understanding of what constitutes a "7D" effect is clarified in the evidence, indicating that many so-called "higher-dimensional" experiences simply layer additional sensory effects (like sound, smell, and wind) onto 3D visuals. These are not additional spatial dimensions but rather enhancements that add to the immersive experience; thus, what is labeled as "7D" is often just an elaboration of 3D displays with added effects [Query 2_evidence_2].

Taking these points into consideration, the video presents an intriguing scenario but ultimately lacks credible evidence for an actual "7D Hologram" whale display in a gymnasium. Therefore, I would evaluate my confidence in this conclusion at **85%**, taking into account the consistency of definitions and descriptions provided in the evidence.

Finally, the clarification on 'dimensions' indicates that what is marketed as '7D' is essentially an enhancement of 3D visuals rather than a new form of holography.

7. **voyagela.com**
   - **Website Quality Score: 7/10**
   - **Reasoning**: VoyageLA is a local online publication that covers events and stories in Los Angeles. It tends to focus on individuals and organizations that may not get mainstream attention. While it can provide valuable local insights, it is not known for rigorous fact-checking typical of higher-level journalism, thus it receives a moderate score.

8. **www.e1fx.com**
   - **Website Quality Score: 5/10**
   - **Reasoning**: E1FX specializes in visual effects and does not primarily deal with fact-checking or news-related content. As such, while it may hold certain expertise in its field, it is not deemed a reliable source for accurate news or to counter misinformation.

9. **www.unrealengine.com**
   - **Website Quality Score: 8/10**

"Claim": "A video shows a "7D Hologram" of a whale inside a school gymnasium.",
"Video_information": {"video_date": 20151130.0, "platform": "youtube", "video_headline": "Virual whale 7d", "video_transcript": "", "Video_descriptor": "The video showcases a series of scenes unfolding in various indoor settings, possibly school gymnasiums or community centers. In the first key frame, a gymnasium filled with students is enveloped in a dense cloud of smoke or fog, creating a visually striking atmosphere. The second key frame reveals another gymnasium scene with students seated attentively as water or a similar substance pours from the ceiling, adding an element of surprise and curiosity to the setting. Moving on, the third key frame captures a surreal moment where a whale-like creature emerges dramatically from the water surface in a school gymnasium, captivating the seated audience's attention. In the fourth key frame, a group of students gathers in a spacious gymnasium, indicating a structured event or assembly taking place. The fifth key frame portrays a similar indoor setting with a large cloud of smoke or fog at the center, prompting the observing students to witness this mysterious occurrence. Lastly, the sixth and seventh key frames depict scenes from separate gymnasium events, with students seated in an organized manner, either listening attentively or observing white smoke covering the gym floor. Each key frame offers a unique glimpse into these unconventional and intriguing indoor happenings, leaving the viewer intrigued by the unusual events unfolding within these familiar school environments."},
"QA_CONTEXTS": {"Initial_Question_Generation": {"Question": "Does the video provide credible evidence for a '7D Hologram' whale in a gymnasium?", "Answer": "The video claiming to show a \"7D Hologram\" of a whale in a gymnasium does not provide credible evidence to support this assertion. Here are the reasons:\n\n1. **Misleading Terminology**: The term \"7D Hologram\" is often used in a marketing context with little to no scientific validity. As noted in evidence, it is generally considered a marketing ploy rather than a description of a legitimate technological advancement in holography [Query 1_evidence1]. This suggests that the concept of a \"7D Hologram\" may be exaggerated or not scientifically grounded.\n\n2. **Nature of the Display**: The viral video of the whale appearing in the gymnasium was identified as an example of augmented reality (AR), not a true hologram. The source explains that the perception of a whale breaching was achieved through augmented reality technology, which utilizes visual effects to create a convincing illusion, rather than projecting a hologram [Query 2_evidence_1]. This distinction indicates that the visual spectacle in the video is based on AR rather than holograms.\n\n3. **Clarifications on \"Dimensions\"**: The understanding of what constitutes a \"7D\" effect is clarified in the evidence, indicating that many so-called \"higher-dimensional\" experiences simply layer additional sensory effects (like sound, smell, and wind) onto 3D visuals. These are not additional spatial dimensions but rather enhancements that add to the immersive experience; thus, what is labeled as \"7D\" is often just an elaboration of 3D displays with added effects [Query 2_evidence_2].\n\nTaking these points into consideration, the video presents an intriguing scenario but ultimately lacks credible evidence for an actual \"7D Hologram\" whale display in a gymnasium.", "Confidence": "85%"}},

It was sort of by accident really. I was an art major and just took traditional animation for the credits. In the class another student told me about a 3D animation class. So, I signed up and after the first class I was hooked. I knew this was what I had been searching for at school. I progressed through school and then professional work, using Maya and C4D mostly. I was always frustrated by their limitations when it came to FX.\\nI had heard about Houdini and its capabilities, but its learning curve was so daunting. Finally the right job came in at my work. I needed to make this strange cloud world with these massive tornadoes, and I finally had enough lead time to experiment a little. I downloaded Houdini and went for it. After about a week I was in love. I haven\u2019t stopped using it since.\\n!(blob:https://www.rebelway.net/bf5f9c7517687df7c8b66729287d9254)\\nWhat do you currently do for work?\\n----------------------------------\\nI am an Art Director at Possible Productions. I do a huge range of things from live events to broadcast, concert visuals, architectural installations and most recently XR/AR virtual production.\\nHow is the process of approaching live-event FX different from a \u2018typical\u2019 project designed for screens?\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThe biggest difference in live events is scale. The large scale LED or projection surfaces we build for have native resolutions that are often over 10K. The cloud world I first experimented with Houdini on, for example, had a delivery raster that was 60K. And our lead times are typically measured in weeks, not months or years. So we have to be efficient with how we approach everything in the scene, from geometry to lighting to FX.\\nStill, I can work within Houdini and set up my shots, or usually loops, in a very traditional vfx pipeline when it comes to live event screen content like concerts or installations. It just depends on what the project needs. With live virtual production events however, it requires many more steps to get from Houdini to a finished product within a real-time rendering engine like Unreal. And now we\u2019re also optimizing for frame rate.\\n!(blob:https://www.rebelway.net/f145937391ce1a64fd62bd6cdabf46c...[Content truncated]\"\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"evidence3\": {\n            \"title\": \"Notch - The Real-time Graphics Tool\",\n            \"link\": \"https://www.notch.one/\",\n            \"displayLink\": \"www.notch.one\",\n            \"snippet\": \"A real-time workflow for production of video content, live visual effects, VR and interactive experiences.\",\n            \"htmlSnippet\": \"A real-time workflow for production of video content, <b>live visual effects</b>, VR and interactive experiences.\",\n            \"website_content\": \"[Content truncated]... *   \\n*   INDUSTRIES\\n    *   \\n    *   \\n    *   \\n*   \\n*   \\n    *   \\n    *   \\n    *   \\n    *   \\n    *   \\n*   \\n    *   \\n    *   \\n    *   \\n    *   \\n    *   \\n    *   \\n    *   \\n    *   \\n    *   \\n    *   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\nCreate Amazing Motion Graphics and Interactive VFX in Real-Time\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n### Trusted by the world\u2019s biggest artists, brands and events, Notch is the first tool that enables you to create interactive and video content in one unified real-time environment.\\n### Don\u2019t\u00a0Wait.\u00a0Create\\nThe workflow you always wanted: Create, simulate, render, composite, edit, and play: always in real-time, **always working on the full and final result**.\\n### Live\u00a0Visuals Redefined\\nCreate interactive and generative content and live video effects in a powerful, easy and stable workflow.

"Claim": "A video shows a "7D Hologram" of a whale inside a school gymnasium.",
"Video_information": {"video_date": 20151130.0, "platform": "youtube", "video_headline": "Virual whale 7d", "video_transcript": "", "Video_descriptor": "The video showcases a series of scenes unfolding in various indoor settings, possibly school gymnasiums or community centers. In the first key frame, a gymnasium filled with students is enveloped in a dense cloud of smoke or fog, creating a visually striking atmosphere. The second key frame reveals another gymnasium scene with students seated attentively as water or a similar substance pours from the ceiling, adding an element of surprise and curiosity to the setting. Moving on, the third key frame captures a surreal moment where a whale-like creature emerges dramatically from the water surface in a school gymnasium, captivating the seated audience's attention. In the fourth key frame, a group of students gathers in a spacious gymnasium, indicating a structured event or assembly taking place. The fifth key frame portrays a similar indoor setting with a large cloud of smoke or fog at the center, prompting the observing students to witness this mysterious occurrence. Lastly, the sixth and seventh key frames depict scenes from separate gymnasium events, with students seated in an organized manner, either listening attentively or observing white smoke covering the gym floor. Each key frame offers a unique glimpse into these unconventional and intriguing indoor happenings, leaving the viewer intrigued by the unusual events unfolding within these familiar school environments."},
"QA_CONTEXTS": {"Initial_Question_Generation": {"Question": "Does the video provide credible evidence for a '7D Hologram' whale in a gymnasium?", "Answer": "The video claiming to show a \"7D Hologram\" of a whale in a gymnasium does not provide credible evidence to support this assertion. Here are the reasons:\n\n1. **Misleading Terminology**: The term \"7D Hologram\" is often used in a marketing context with little to no scientific validity. As noted in evidence, it is generally considered a marketing ploy rather than a description of a legitimate technological advancement in holography [Query 1_evidence1]. This suggests that the concept of a \"7D Hologram\" may be exaggerated or not scientifically grounded.\n\n2. **Nature of the Display**: The viral video of the whale appearing in the gymnasium was identified as an example of augmented reality (AR), not a true hologram. The source explains that the perception of a whale breaching was achieved through augmented reality technology, which utilizes visual effects to create a convincing illusion, rather than projecting a hologram [Query 2_evidence_1]. This distinction indicates that the visual spectacle in the video is based on AR rather than holograms.\n\n3. **Clarifications on \"Dimensions\"**: The understanding of what constitutes a \"7D\" effect is clarified in the evidence, indicating that many so-called \"higher-dimensional\" experiences simply layer additional sensory effects (like sound, smell, and wind) onto 3D visuals. These are not additional spatial dimensions but rather enhancements that add to the immersive experience; thus, what is labeled as \"7D\" is often just an elaboration of 3D displays with added effects [Query 2_evidence_2].\n\nTaking these points into consideration, the video presents an intriguing scenario but ultimately lacks credible evidence for an actual \"7D Hologram\" whale display in a gymnasium.", "Confidence": "85%"}},

AR Tool\\nOne of the most successful examples of an AR system is zSpace\u00ae \\\\\\\\]. In 2015, zSpace\u00ae Inc. released the all-in-one solution for education consisting of a virtual reality monitor and computer. The system provides students with a realistic learning environment that is aligned with the next generation science standards (NGSS), common core, and state standards. The virtual-holographic images can be lifted from the screen and manipulated with the accompanying stylus. The solution allows for group interaction, as participants only need 3D glasses, as opposed to VR headsets \\\\\\\\].\\nThe zSpace\u00ae system uses a 1920 \u00d7 1080 pixel LCD screen, and the hardware switches between the left and right images through a circularly polarized light that enters the eye. The glasses contain small reflective tabs that the computer uses to track where users are looking. This software prevents nausea and headaches by keeping the image focused.\\nzSpace\u00ae combines elements of AR and VR to create lifelike experiences that are immersive and interactive. The system lets the students dissect animals and organs, manipulate compounds and structures in 3D, and run experiments without the need for costly lab equipment and supplies.\\nzSpace\u00ae was chosen as the AR tool for STEM education () at the 134 Dimcho Debelianov School in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 2018 \\\\,\\\\]).\\n#### 2.2. AR Tool Application\\nzSpace\u00ae consists of several learning and simulation applications. Some of them are: zSpace\u00ae Studio\u2014a collection of models from various subject areas and a set of pre-made activities, available in different languages; Newton\u2019s Park\u2014a physics simulation environment, promoting discovery through experimentation and allowing data gathering and analysis; Human Anatomy Atlas\u2014for independent student research on the human body, allowing self-assessment of learning at the same time.\\nThe key factors in choosing the solution were:\\n*   Scope\u2014the technology can be used in many subjects and can address different problems;\\n*   Collaboration\u2014the possibility for working in small groups of 2 or 3 students; the technology itself encourages teamwork;\\n*   Experimentation\u2014opportunities to perform scientific procedures;\\n*   Creativity\u2014creativity is encouraged, and they can let their imaginations run riot and take risks without fear of failure;\\n*   Critical thinking and evaluation\u2014the technology supports complex problem solving and evaluative thinking, helping them to analyse and understand abstract concepts better.\\n#### 2.3.

Schlieski says, \\\"When you see that, you're like, 'That's gonna be a problem!' I thought they might get distracted, loud, noisy, fidgety. But they didn't. They were riveted. They sat, literally on the edge of their seats, and joined in with the standing ovation after. I was so encouraged.\\\"\\nKey to producing that kind of response in audiences is the motion-capture suit, provided by Imaginarium and worn by actor Mark Quartley. The suit monitors his movements and they in turn dictate the movement of Ariel as he is projected on to the screen. During a long training process, Quartley figured out how to make the sprite fly, plead, terrify, torment, and, as Schlieski puts it, \\\"split apart into all these little shapes, and he's singing, and I think in that moment the avatar really helps capture the unbound joy that Ariel is expressing.\\\" The techniques are already winning acclaim from critics in the British press for tech's ability to turn Shakespeare's plays into a new kind of spectacle.\\nThe play \u2014 widely believed to be the last that Shakespeare wrote alone \u2014 is itself the tale of an elderly man named Prospero's struggle to secure the life prospects of his daughter, Miranda \u2014 to secure his legacy. It seems absurd to suggest that we might abandon all interest in Shakespeare if the people charged with putting on his work don't keep up-to-date with the latest technological advancements; his popularity does not depend utterly on a motion-capture suit.\\n\\\"Shakespeare possessed a remarkable imagination that was really grounded in human experience,\\\" explains Schlieski. \\\"At its core, The Tempest is about a man getting older, facing his own mortality, and thinking about what he wants for his daughter. What is his relationship with the people he has been in conflict with throughout his life? I think that's not a story which is particularly bound to an Elizabethan timeframe \u2013 it's something we all have to master as we approach the sunset, and figure out: What is the legacy that we want to leave behind?\\\"\\nThis content was paid for by...[Content truncated]\"\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"evidence4\": {\n            \"title\": \"Augmented Reality Technology Brings Learning to Life | Harvard ...\",\n            \"link\": \"https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/usable-knowledge/09/09/augmented-reality-technology-brings-learning-life\",\n            \"displayLink\": \"www.gse.harvard.edu\",\n            \"snippet\": \"Sep 2, 2009 ...

Also, many of them think academic subjects are abstract and have little to do with the world around them.

Outfitted with cell phones and GPS-enabled, handheld computers, students at each school were directed to nearby locations to interview virtual characters and inspect digital items related to a mysterious alien invasion. Working through math and literacy problems enabled students to determine why the aliens had landed. Using the same technology, but incorporating lessons learned from _Alien Contact!_, the team tested a second curriculum in 2008. _Gray Anatomy_ asked participants to solve the mystery of why a gray whale had beached itself nearby. In both exercises, students worked in groups, and each student in the group was assigned a unique role and received different clues or questions to answer. Assembling the pieces of the puzzle required not just factual knowledge, but also effective communication and collaboration.\\n### Learning from Aliens\\n\\\"In terms of designing an augmented reality curriculum,\\\" said O'Shea, \\\"we were learning by doing.

The use of augmented reality (AR) technology, as one form of digital technology, is increasingly embedded in digital applications because it allows individuals to interact with real and virtual objects. A significant body of research has reported the benefits afforded by the use of AR technology in schools and higher education settings. However, little is known about the contribution of AR technology to teaching practice and child learning outcomes in the preschool years. Here, we present a summary of the limited research that has explored the use of AR in preschool curricula and argue for the need for further research to explore the contribution of AR to high-quality pedagogical practice.\\nGet full access to this article\\n-------------------------------\\nView all access and purchase options for this article.\\nReferences\\n----------\\nAk\u00e7ay\u0131r M., Ak\u00e7ay\u0131r G.

"QA_CONTEXTS": {
  "Initial_Question_Generation": {
    "Question": "Does the video provide credible evidence for a '7D Hologram' whale in a gymnasium?",
    "Answer": "The video claiming to show a \"7D Hologram\" of a whale in a gymnasium does not provide credible evidence to support this assertion. Here are the reasons:\n\n1. **Misleading Terminology**: The term \"7D Hologram\" is often used in a marketing context with little to no scientific validity. As noted in evidence, it is generally considered a marketing ploy rather than a description of a legitimate technological advancement in holography [Query 1_evidence1]. This suggests that the concept of a \"7D Hologram\" may be exaggerated or not scientifically grounded.\n\n2. **Nature of the Display**: The viral video of the whale appearing in the gymnasium was identified as an example of augmented reality (AR), not a true hologram. The source explains that the perception of a whale breaching was achieved through augmented reality technology, which utilizes visual effects to create a convincing illusion, rather than projecting a hologram [Query 2_evidence_1]. This distinction indicates that the visual spectacle in the video is based on AR rather than holograms.\n\n3. **Clarifications on \"Dimensions\"**: The understanding of what constitutes a \"7D\" effect is clarified in the evidence, indicating that many so-called \"higher-dimensional\" experiences simply layer additional sensory effects (like sound, smell, and wind) onto 3D visuals. These are not additional spatial dimensions but rather enhancements that add to the immersive experience; thus, what is labeled as \"7D\" is often just an elaboration of 3D displays with added effects [Query 2_evidence_2].\n\nTaking these points into consideration, the video presents an intriguing scenario but ultimately lacks credible evidence for an actual \"7D Hologram\" whale display in a gymnasium.",

AR Tool\nOne of the most successful examples of an AR system is zSpace\u00ae \\\\]. In 2015, zSpace\u00ae Inc. released the all-in-one solution for education consisting of a virtual reality monitor and computer. The system provides students with a realistic learning environment that is aligned with the next generation science standards (NGSS), common core, and state standards. The virtual-holographic images can be lifted from the screen and manipulated with the accompanying stylus. The solution allows for group interaction, as participants only need 3D glasses, as opposed to VR headsets \\\\].\nThe zSpace\u00ae system uses a 1920 \u00d7 1080 pixel LCD screen, and the hardware switches between the left and right images through a circularly polarized light that enters the eye. The glasses contain small reflective tabs that the computer uses to track where users are looking. This software prevents nausea and headaches by keeping the image focused.\nzSpace\u00ae combines elements of AR and VR to create lifelike experiences that are immersive and interactive. The system lets the students dissect animals and organs, manipulate compounds and structures in 3D, and run experiments without the need for costly lab equipment and supplies.\nzSpace\u00ae was chosen as the AR tool for STEM education () at the 134 Dimcho Debelianov School in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 2018 \\,\\]).\n#### 2.2.

    "Initial_Question_Generation": {
        "Question": "Does the video provide credible evidence for a '7D Hologram' whale in a gymnasium?",
        "Answer": "The video claiming to show a \"7D Hologram\" of a whale in a gymnasium does not provide credible evidence to support this assertion. Here are the reasons:\n\n1. **Misleading Terminology**: The term \"7D Hologram\" is often used in a marketing context with little to no scientific validity. As noted in evidence, it is generally considered a marketing ploy rather than a description of a legitimate technological advancement in holography [Query 1_evidence1]. This suggests that the concept of a \"7D Hologram\" may be exaggerated or not scientifically grounded.\n\n2. **Nature of the Display**: The viral video of the whale appearing in the gymnasium was identified as an example of augmented reality (AR), not a true hologram. The source explains that the perception of a whale breaching was achieved through augmented reality technology, which utilizes visual effects to create a convincing illusion, rather than projecting a hologram [Query 2_evidence_1]. This distinction indicates that the visual spectacle in the video is based on AR rather than holograms.\n\n3. **Clarifications on \"Dimensions\"**: The understanding of what constitutes a \"7D\" effect is clarified in the evidence, indicating that many so-called \"higher-dimensional\" experiences simply layer additional sensory effects (like sound, smell, and wind) onto 3D visuals. These are not additional spatial dimensions but rather enhancements that add to the immersive experience; thus, what is labeled as \"7D\" is often just an elaboration of 3D displays with added effects [Query 2_evidence_2].\n\nTaking these points into consideration, the video presents an intriguing scenario but ultimately lacks credible evidence for an actual \"7D Hologram\" whale display in a gymnasium.",

2024-08-01 19:48:20 - MainThread - INFO - The visual effects seen in the gymnasium video featuring the whale were created using augmented reality (AR) technology. Here are the key reasons supporting this conclusion:

1. **Nature of Augmented Reality**: The video is recognized as an example of augmented reality, which enhances the real-world environment with computer-generated visual elements. AR uses various devices, such as smartphones or tablets, to overlay digital content onto the physical world, creating interactive experiences without the need for specialized holographic displays. This is distinct from traditional holography, which relies on projecting light to create three-dimensional images. Thus, the whale's appearance in the video was realized through AR rather than a legitimate hologram [Query 2_evidence_1].

2. **Market Understanding of AR**: The rise of AR in educational and exhibition settings has highlighted its capabilities to create visually engaging experiences. In many instances, AR has been successfully implemented in museums and schools, providing interactive and immersive ways to engage audiences. The technology allows for the addition of visual effects to existing environments, enhancing realism and interactivity in presentations. This contextual understanding aligns with the kind of impressive visual display seen in the video [Query 1_evidence_1].

3. **Examples of AR Applications**: Specifically, there are detailed cases where AR applications have been used effectively in educational contexts, demonstrating how layered digital content can create engaging learning environments. Such systems allow users to interact with and manipulate 3D representations of various subjects, which capsulates the experience viewers had with the whale in the gymnasium setting—where students presumably witnessed an animated whale breaching in an otherwise familiar reality [Query 1_evidence_2].

In conclusion, the technology that produced the visual effects in the gymnasium video is augmented reality, leveraging interactive digital overlays that create engaging visual spectacles, rather than validated "7D holograms."

Confidence in this assessment is high at **90%**, as the evidence clearly supports AR's role in similar experiences, and the video aligns with established applications of this technology.

AR Tool\nOne of the most successful examples of an AR system is zSpace\u00ae \\\\]. In 2015, zSpace\u00ae Inc. released the all-in-one solution for education consisting of a virtual reality monitor and computer. The system provides students with a realistic learning environment that is aligned with the next generation science standards (NGSS), common core, and state standards. The virtual-holographic images can be lifted from the screen and manipulated with the accompanying stylus. The solution allows for group interaction, as participants only need 3D glasses, as opposed to VR headsets \\\\].\nThe zSpace\u00ae system uses a 1920 \u00d7 1080 pixel LCD screen, and the hardware switches between the left and right images through a circularly polarized light that enters the eye. The glasses contain small reflective tabs that the computer uses to track where users are looking. This software prevents nausea and headaches by keeping the image focused.\nzSpace\u00ae combines elements of AR and VR to create lifelike experiences that are immersive and interactive. The system lets the students dissect animals and organs, manipulate compounds and structures in 3D, and run experiments without the need for costly lab equipment and supplies.\nzSpace\u00ae was chosen as the AR tool for STEM education () at the 134 Dimcho Debelianov School in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 2018 \\,\\]).\n#### 2.2. AR Tool Application\nzSpace\u00ae consists of several learning and simulation applications. Some of them are: zSpace\u00ae Studio\u2014a collection of models from various subject areas and a set of pre-made activities, available in different languages; Newton\u2019s Park\u2014a physics simulation environment, promoting discovery through experimentation and allowing data gathering and analysis; Human Anatomy Atlas\u2014for independent student research on the human body, allowing self-assessment of learning at the same time.\nThe key factors in choosing the solution were:\n*   Scope\u2014the technology can be used in many subjects and can address different problems;\n*   Collaboration\u2014the possibility for working in small groups of 2 or 3 students; the technology itself encourages teamwork;\n*   Experimentation\u2014opportunities to perform scientific procedures;\n*   Creativity\u2014creativity is encouraged, and they can let their imaginations run riot and take risks without fear of failure;\n*   Critical thinking and evaluation\u2014the technology supports complex problem solving and evaluative thinking, helping them to analyse and understand abstract concepts better.\n#### 2.3.

Here are the key reasons supporting this conclusion:\n\n1. **Nature of Augmented Reality**: The video is recognized as an example of augmented reality, which enhances the real-world environment with computer-generated visual elements. AR uses various devices, such as smartphones or tablets, to overlay digital content onto the physical world, creating interactive experiences without the need for specialized holographic displays. This is distinct from traditional holography, which relies on projecting light to create three-dimensional images. Thus, the whale's appearance in the video was realized through AR rather than a legitimate hologram [Query 2_evidence_1].\n\n2. **Market Understanding of AR**: The rise of AR in educational and exhibition settings has highlighted its capabilities to create visually engaging experiences. In many instances, AR has been successfully implemented in museums and schools, providing interactive and immersive ways to engage audiences. The technology allows for the addition of visual effects to existing environments, enhancing realism and interactivity in presentations. This contextual understanding aligns with the kind of impressive visual display seen in the video [Query 1_evidence_1].\n\n3. **Examples of AR Applications**: Specifically, there are detailed cases where AR applications have been used effectively in educational contexts, demonstrating how layered digital content can create engaging learning environments. Such systems allow users to interact with and manipulate 3D representations of various subjects, which capsulates the experience viewers had with the whale in the gymnasium setting\u2014where students presumably witnessed an animated whale breaching in an otherwise familiar reality [Query 1_evidence_2].\n\nIn conclusion, the technology that produced the visual effects in the gymnasium video is augmented reality, leveraging interactive digital overlays that create engaging visual spectacles, rather than validated '7D holograms.'", "Confidence": "90%"}},
