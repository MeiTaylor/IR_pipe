In addition, you may send questions or comments to the FTC staff’s COPPA mailbox, . **This document represents the views of FTC staff and is not binding on the Commission.** To view the Rule and compliance materials, go to the . This document serves as a small entity compliance guide pursuant to the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act.\nSome FAQs refer to a document called a Statement of Basis and Purpose. A Statement of Basis and Purpose is a document an agency issues when it promulgates or amends a rule that explains the rule’s provisions and addresses comments received in the rulemaking process. A Statement of Basis and Purpose was issued when the COPPA Rule was promulgated in 1999, and another Statement of Basis and Purpose was issued when the Rule was revised in 2013.\nA. GENERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE COPPA RULE\n-----------------------------------------\n### 1\\. What is the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule?\nCongress enacted the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in 1998. COPPA required the Federal Trade Commission to issue and enforce regulations concerning children’s online privacy. The Commission’s original COPPA Rule became effective on April 21, 2000. The Commission published an amended Rule on January 17, 2013. The amended Rule took effect on July 1, 2013.\nThe primary goal of COPPA is to place parents in control over what information is collected from their young children online. The Rule was designed to protect children under age 13, while accounting for the dynamic nature of the Internet. The Rule applies to operators of commercial websites and online services (including mobile apps and IoT devices, such as smart toys) directed to children under 13 that collect, use, or disclose personal information from children, or on whose behalf such information is collected or maintained (such as when personal information is collected by an ad network to serve targeted advertising). The Rule also applies to operators of general audience websites or online services with actual knowledge that they are collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from children under 13, and to websites or online services that have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information directly from users of another website or online service directed to children. Operators covered by the Rule must...[Content truncated]",

For all that, there is little evidence that this type of monitoring advances security objectives; agencies rarely measure the usefulness of social media monitoring and DHS’s own pilot programs showed that they were not helpful in identifying threats. Nevertheless, the use of social media for a range of purposes continues to grow.\nIn this Q&A, we survey the ways in which federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies use social media monitoring and the risks posed by its thinly regulated and growing use in various contexts.\nWhich federal agencies use social media monitoring?\n---------------------------------------------------\nMany federal agencies use social media, including the  (DHS),  (FBI),  (State Department),  (DEA),  (ATF),  (USPS),  (IRS), , and  (SSA). This document focuses primarily on the activities of DHS, FBI, and the State Department, as the agencies that make the most extensive use of social media for monitoring, targeting, and information collection.\nWhy do federal agencies monitor social media?\n---------------------------------------------\nPublicly available information shows that federal agencies use social media for four main — and sometimes overlapping — purposes. The examples below are illustrative and do not capture the full spectrum of social media surveillance by federal agencies.\n**Investigations**: Law enforcement agencies, such as the FBI and some components of DHS, use social media monitoring to assist with criminal and civil investigations. Some of these investigations may not even require a showing of criminal activity. For example, FBI agents can open an “assessment” simply on the basis of an “authorized purpose,” such as preventing crime or terrorism, and without a factual basis. During assessments, FBI agents can carry out searches of publicly available online information. Subsequent investigative stages, which require some factual basis, open the door for more invasive surveillance tactics, such as the monitoring and recording of chats, direct messages, and other private online communications in real time.\nAt DHS, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) — which is part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — is the Department’s “.” HSI  in its training materials that it has the authority to enforce any federal law, and relies on social media when conducting investigations on matters ranging from civil immigration violations to terrorism. ICE agents can look at publicly available social media content for purposes ranging from finding fugitives to gathering evidence in support of investigations to probing “potential criminal activity,” a “threat detection” function discussed below. Agents can also operate undercover online and monitor private online communications, but the circumstances under which they are permitted to do so are not publicly known.\n**Monitoring to detect threats:** Even without opening...[Content truncated]",

The COPPA statute directed the Federal Trade Commission (“Commission” or “FTC”) to promulgate regulations implementing COPPA's requirements. On November 3, 1999, the Commission issued its Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule, 16 CFR part 312 (“COPPA Rule” or “Rule”), which became effective on April 21, 2000.[1] \n                        \n                         Section 6506 of the COPPA statute and § 312.11 of the initial Rule required that the Commission initiate a review no later than five years after the initial Rule's effective date to evaluate the Rule's implementation. The Commission commenced this mandatory review on April 21, 2005.[2] \n                        \n                         After receiving and considering extensive public comment, the Commission determined in March 2006 to retain the COPPA Rule without change.[3] \n                        \n                         In 2010, the Commission once again undertook a review of the COPPA Rule to determine whether the Rule was keeping pace with changing technology. After notice and comment, the Commission issued final amendments to the Rule, which became effective on July 1, 2013 (“2013 Amendments”).[4] \n\n\n                        The COPPA Rule imposes certain requirements on operators of websites [5] \n                        \n                         or online services directed to children under 13 years of age, and on operators of websites or online services that have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information online from a child under 13 years of age (collectively, “operators”).
