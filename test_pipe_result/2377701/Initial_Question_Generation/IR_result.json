It is one of the largest penalties ever assessed by the U.S. government for any violation.\nThe settlement order announced today also imposes unprecedented new restrictions on Facebook’s business operations and creates multiple channels of compliance. The order requires Facebook to restructure its approach to privacy from the corporate board-level down, and establishes strong new mechanisms to ensure that Facebook executives are accountable for the decisions they make about privacy, and that those decisions are subject to meaningful oversight.\n“Despite repeated promises to its billions of users worldwide that they could control how their personal information is shared, Facebook undermined consumers’ choices,” said FTC Chairman Joe Simons. “The magnitude of the $5 billion penalty and sweeping conduct relief are unprecedented in the history of the FTC. The relief is designed not only to punish future violations but, more importantly, to change Facebook’s entire privacy culture to decrease the likelihood of continued violations. The Commission takes consumer privacy seriously, and will enforce FTC orders to the fullest extent of the law.”\n“The Department of Justice is committed to protecting consumer data privacy and ensuring that social media companies like Facebook do not mislead individuals about the use of their personal information,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt for the Department of Justice’s Civil Division. “This settlement’s historic penalty and compliance terms will benefit American consumers, and the Department expects Facebook to treat its privacy obligations with the utmost seriousness.”\nMore than 185 million people in the United States and Canada use Facebook on a daily basis. Facebook monetizes user information through targeted advertising, which generated most of the company’s $55.8 billion in revenues in 2018. To encourage users to share information on its platform, Facebook promises users they can control the privacy of their information through Facebook’s privacy settings.\nFollowing a yearlong investigation by the FTC, the Department of Justice will file a  to undermine users’ privacy preferences in violation of its 2012 FTC order. These tactics allowed the company to share users’ personal information with third-party apps that were downloaded by the user’s Facebook “friends.” The FTC alleges that many users were unaware that Facebook was sharing such information, and therefore did not take the steps needed to opt-out of sharing.\nIn addition, the FTC...[Content truncated]",

It is one of the largest penalties ever assessed by the U.S. government for any violation.\nThe settlement order announced today also imposes unprecedented new restrictions on Facebook’s business operations and creates multiple channels of compliance. The order requires Facebook to restructure its approach to privacy from the corporate board-level down, and establishes strong new mechanisms to ensure that Facebook executives are accountable for the decisions they make about privacy, and that those decisions are subject to meaningful oversight.\n“Despite repeated promises to its billions of users worldwide that they could control how their personal information is shared, Facebook undermined consumers’ choices,” said FTC Chairman Joe Simons. “The magnitude of the $5 billion penalty and sweeping conduct relief are unprecedented in the history of the FTC. The relief is designed not only to punish future violations but, more importantly, to change Facebook’s entire privacy culture to decrease the likelihood of continued violations. The Commission takes consumer privacy seriously, and will enforce FTC orders to the fullest extent of the law.”\n“The Department of Justice is committed to protecting consumer data privacy and ensuring that social media companies like Facebook do not mislead individuals about the use of their personal information,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt for the Department of Justice’s Civil Division. “This settlement’s historic penalty and compliance terms will benefit American consumers, and the Department expects Facebook to treat its privacy obligations with the utmost seriousness.”\nMore than 185 million people in the United States and Canada use Facebook on a daily basis. Facebook monetizes user information through targeted advertising, which generated most of the company’s $55.8 billion in revenues in 2018. To encourage users to share information on its platform, Facebook promises users they can control the privacy of their information through Facebook’s privacy settings.\nFollowing a yearlong investigation by the FTC, the Department of Justice will file a  to undermine users’ privacy preferences in violation of its 2012 FTC order. These tactics allowed the company to share users’ personal information with third-party apps that were downloaded by the user’s Facebook “friends.” The FTC alleges that many users were unaware that Facebook was sharing such information, and therefore did not take the steps needed to opt-out of sharing.\nIn addition, the FTC...[Content truncated]"

    "QA": {
        "Question": "Does posting a legal notice on social media prevent public disclosure of user posts according to Meta's policies?",
        "Answer": "Posting a legal notice on social media does not prevent public disclosure of user posts according to Meta's policies. Here are the reasons:\n\n1. **Hoax Nature of Social Media Copyright Notices**: There have been widespread hoaxes about posting copyright notices on Facebook, claiming it provides protection over media shared on the platform. Meta itself has clarified that these claims are false and that simply posting a notice does not change the ownership of the content. Facebook does not own user-generated content, but users also cannot unilaterally claim copyright protections by posting a legal disclaimer on their wall.\n\n2. **Compliance with Legal Requests**: Meta’s policies state that they disclose account records in accordance with applicable laws and terms of service. This means that if requested by law enforcement or through legal processes, user content such as posts, photos, and messages may still be disclosed regardless of whether a user has tried to protect those posts with a notice.\n\n3. **Privacy and Control Mechanisms**: While Meta has mechanisms for users to manage their privacy settings, these tools do not include the efficacy of legal notices posted by users. Users can manage privacy settings and control what information they share, but these controls do not hinge on the posting of disclaimers or notices. They are instead linked to the configurations provided within the platform.",
