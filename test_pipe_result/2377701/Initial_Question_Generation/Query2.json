It is one of the largest penalties ever assessed by the U.S. government for any violation.\nThe settlement order announced today also imposes unprecedented new restrictions on Facebook’s business operations and creates multiple channels of compliance. The order requires Facebook to restructure its approach to privacy from the corporate board-level down, and establishes strong new mechanisms to ensure that Facebook executives are accountable for the decisions they make about privacy, and that those decisions are subject to meaningful oversight.\n“Despite repeated promises to its billions of users worldwide that they could control how their personal information is shared, Facebook undermined consumers’ choices,” said FTC Chairman Joe Simons. “The magnitude of the $5 billion penalty and sweeping conduct relief are unprecedented in the history of the FTC. The relief is designed not only to punish future violations but, more importantly, to change Facebook’s entire privacy culture to decrease the likelihood of continued violations.

A Tl;DR is:\nMonica was a moderator on 6 different sites and was a highly decorated moderator. She had contributed frequently to the growth of the entire Stack Exchange community and was appointed as a moderator on MSE in recognition of that. She was fired after she requested clarifications on a new policy and a change in the CoC. Here is her version of the story:  .\nA lot of moderators then resigned due to the way Stack Exchange treated her. . Stack Exchange later spoke about her in newspapers. The Director and CTO of Stack Exchange later posted public apologies, but didn't do anything to follow up their apologies. Finally after taking the legal route (), Monica was able to sign off on an agreement (), which wasn't _that_ helpful.\nLater on, Stack Exchange fired a couple of Community Managers (who work for the company) which started another set of moderator resignations. . These two community managers were known to be very deeply involved with the community, which makes this issue a bit more complex.

In that it's not a single error or misjudgement SE did. There has been a growing problem for literal years. The actions SE took against Monica would in no way be justified even without previous missteps however, _combined_ with them it was the catalist for a drastic shift in opinion about the management.

This systemic online censorship has risen against the backdrop of unprecedented violence, including an estimated 1,200 people killed in Israel, largely in the Hamas-led attack on October 7, and over 18,000 Palestinians killed as of December 14, largely as a result of intense Israeli bombardment.\nBetween October and November 2023, Human Rights Watch documented over 1,050 takedowns and other suppression of content Instagram and Facebook that had been posted by Palestinians and their supporters, including about human rights abuses. Human Rights Watch publicly solicited cases of any type of online censorship and of any type of viewpoints related to Israel and Palestine. Of the 1,050 cases reviewed for this report, 1,049 involved peaceful content in support of Palestine that was censored or otherwise unduly suppressed, while one case involved removal of content in support of Israel. The documented cases include content originating from over 60 countries around the world, primarily in English, all of peaceful support of Palestine, expressed in diverse ways. This distribution of cases does not necessarily reflect the overall distribution of censorship. Hundreds of people continued to report censorship after Human Rights Watch...[Content truncated]",
