For example, maybe you've been shopping around for a new mattress and finally found the one. Now that your hunt is over, maybe you don't wanna see ads from certain mattress brands anymore. If so, you can go to ad preferences and hide ads from those specific advertisers or manage your ad settings more generally. Or remember that rewards card?

    "Judgment": "No",
    "Confidence": "10%",
    "Reason": "The claim suggests that posting a legal notice on social media will protect a user from having their posts and photos made public. However, the information provided in the Video_information does not address or verify the legal implications of posting on social media or how such actions affect privacy settings. The video transcript focuses on how Meta collects and uses user data but does not mention any protective measures related to posting legal notices or privacy. Therefore, while the video reinforces that users can manage their ad preferences and review their off-Facebook activity, it does not provide sufficient information to confirm or deny the truthfulness of the claim regarding legal notices and privacy protection."

  "Task": "Determine if online information searching is needed to answer the new question. Consider the following criteria:

1. Online search is generally recommended for most questions to provide comprehensive and up-to-date information.
2. If the question can be fully and confidently answered using only the given 'Claim', 'Video_information', and 'QA_CONTEXTS', online search may not be necessary.
3. If the question specifically asks about details or content exclusively present in the video, online search may not be needed.
4. For any question that could benefit from additional context, background, or current information, online search is recommended.

Based on these criteria, determine if online search is needed (Yes or No). If online search could potentially provide any useful information or context, even if not strictly necessary, choose 'Yes'. Only choose 'No' if the question is entirely about specific video content that cannot be found online.

If the result is 'Yes', generate two new queries for Google Custom Search API. If 'No', do not provide any queries.

If generating queries:
- Ensure Query 1 and Query 2 focus on different aspects of the question and are not repetitive.
- Each query should be concise (not exceeding 10 words) and suitable for Google Custom Search API.
- Provide key terms that represent the core focus of each specific query. Key terms must be a single word.

Note: The generated queries should be phrases suitable for Google Search.

2024-08-02 08:23:30 - ThreadPoolExecutor-14_1 - INFO - Here are the evaluations of the listed websites based on their overall reliability, historical accuracy, and capability to detect and expose fake news. 

1. **about.meta.com**
   - **Website Quality Score (website_quality): 8/10**
   - **Explanation:** This site is the official web presence of Meta, which oversees Facebook and Instagram. As the source of information about their services, policies, and data practices, it is generally reliable for understanding how user data is handled. However, as it is run by Meta, some may question the impartiality of the information presented, particularly concerning the implications of data privacy. Despite this, it generally provides accurate and relevant information directly from the company.

2. **www.facebook.com**
   - **Website Quality Score (website_quality): 7/10**
   - **Explanation:** As the primary platform for Facebook, this site provides official updates, guidelines, and user support. While it is a credible source for Facebook's policies and functionalities, the platform has faced criticism for handling misinformation and user privacy. The content can also sometimes be biased toward promoting its own features and services. Therefore, while it can be a valuable resource, caution is recommended regarding its overall reliability concerning external news content.

3. **www.ftc.gov**
   - **Website Quality Score (website_quality): 9/10**
   - **Explanation:** The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is a U.S. government agency responsible for consumer protection and enforcing antitrust laws. It has a strong historical record of providing accurate information about privacy policies, business practices, and consumer rights. The FTC also investigates cases of misinformation, particularly those affecting consumers. Its government affiliation lends significant credibility. 

4. **transparency.meta.com**
   - **Website Quality Score (website_quality): 7/10**
   - **Explanation:** This site offers transparency reports and updates from Meta regarding their policies on data collection, privacy, and security. It is a useful resource for understanding Meta’s operations. However, similar to the concerns with about.meta.com, the information might be presented in a manner that favors the company's perspective. Still, it strives for accountability and transparency.

5. **www.metacareers.com**
   - **Website Quality Score (website_quality): 6/10**
   - **Explanation:** This website is primarily focused on employment opportunities at Meta. While it provides information regarding company culture and job postings, it is not particularly useful in the context of misinformation or detecting fake news. Its reliability is more geared towards job seekers, and therefore, it has limited credibility in terms of providing accurate information on broader topics.

6. **help.instagram.com**
   - **Website Quality Score (website_quality): 7/10**
   - **Explanation:** This is the official help center for Instagram, offering guidance and support for users. The information provided here is reliable for understanding Instagram’s features and policies. However, similar to Facebook, the content may not critically engage with external criticisms of the platform’s handling of misinformation, limiting its value for evaluating news integrity.

7. **about.fb.com**
   - **Website Quality Score (website_quality): 7/10**
   - **Explanation:** This site serves as Facebook's official news portal, where it shares updates and information about the platform. While it posts accurate information regarding its services, the potential for bias exists as the platform may downplay controversies related to misinformation or privacy issues. It is useful for official updates but should not be relied upon exclusively for critical evaluations.

8. **meta.stackoverflow.com**
   - **Website Quality Score (website_quality): 5/10**
   - **Explanation:** This is a Question and Answer platform specifically for Meta-related development topics. While it can provide answers on technical questions, it does not directly contribute to assessing credibility concerning news and misinformation. The quality of information can vary significantly depending on user contributions, thus lowering its overall reliability in the context given.

9. **www.hrw.org**
   - **Website Quality Score (website_quality): 9/10**
   - **Explanation:** Human Rights Watch (HRW) is an international organization that monitors and reports on human rights issues worldwide. It has a strong reputation for accurate reporting and advocacy. Although it does not focus solely on misinformation, its investigations into privacy and freedom of expression lend it a reliable authority on issues involving data, privacy, and protections against misinformation.

In summary, the websites vary in their ability to provide reliable information and detect fake news, with government and human rights organizations generally rated higher due to their established track records in those areas.

It is one of the largest penalties ever assessed by the U.S. government for any violation.\\nThe settlement order announced today also imposes unprecedented new restrictions on Facebook\u2019s business operations and creates multiple channels of compliance. The order requires Facebook to restructure its approach to privacy from the corporate board-level down, and establishes strong new mechanisms to ensure that Facebook executives are accountable for the decisions they make about privacy, and that those decisions are subject to meaningful oversight.\\n\u201cDespite repeated promises to its billions of users worldwide that they could control how their personal information is shared, Facebook undermined consumers\u2019 choices,\u201d said FTC Chairman Joe Simons. \u201cThe magnitude of the $5 billion penalty and sweeping conduct relief are unprecedented in the history of the FTC. The relief is designed not only to punish future violations but, more importantly, to change Facebook\u2019s entire privacy culture to decrease the likelihood of continued violations.

Facebook monetizes user information through targeted advertising, which generated most of the company\u2019s $55.8 billion in revenues in 2018.

She was fired after she requested clarifications on a new policy and a change in the CoC. Here is her version of the story:  .\\nA lot of moderators then resigned due to the way Stack Exchange treated her. . Stack Exchange later spoke about her in newspapers. The Director and CTO of Stack Exchange later posted public apologies, but didn't do anything to follow up their apologies. Finally after taking the legal route (), Monica was able to sign off on an agreement (), which wasn't _that_ helpful.\\nLater on, Stack Exchange fired a couple of Community Managers (who work for the company) which started another set of moderator resignations. .

2024-08-02 08:23:45 - ThreadPoolExecutor-14_0 - INFO - ################## Google Search Terms Output (Attempt 0) ##################
2024-08-02 08:23:45 - ThreadPoolExecutor-14_0 - INFO - Here’s an evaluation of the listed websites based on their credibility concerning truthfulness and accuracy, particularly in the context of addressing the claim about legal notices on social media platforms and detecting misinformation.

### 1. www.ftc.gov (Federal Trade Commission)
**Quality Score: 9/10**
**Reasoning:** The Federal Trade Commission is a reputable government agency that focuses on consumer protection and antitrust laws. They publish well-researched guidelines and resources concerning consumer rights, privacy, and advertising practices, which includes relevant information on how social media companies handle data and user privacy. Historical accuracy is high, as they provide factual and research-backed information. The FTC is instrumental in exposing misleading practices, making it reliable for detecting fake news and consumer misinformation.

### 2. www.nj.gov (State of New Jersey Government)
**Quality Score: 7/10**
**Reasoning:** As an official state government website, New Jersey's government site provides accurate information related to state laws, including privacy and consumer protection. While overall reliable, the site is more localized and may not have the comprehensive resources available at the federal level. However, for state-specific legislation and consumer rights issues, it remains a credible source.

### 3. www.ftc.gov (Federal Trade Commission)
**Quality Score: 9/10**
**Reasoning:** This is a repetition of the previous entry. Yet again, the Federal Trade Commission publishes reliable guidelines regarding consumer rights and is proactive in exposing misinformation. Therefore, it retains its high score for credibility.

### 4. www.brennancenter.org (Brennan Center for Justice)
**Quality Score: 8/10**
**Reasoning:** The Brennan Center is a non-partisan law and policy institute that conducts rigorous research and advocacy on issues related to democracy and justice, including privacy and voting rights. They provide credible information and are known for a commitment to factual reporting. Their publications often address issues of misinformation and its impacts on democracy, which supports their reputation for reliability.

### 5. studentprivacy.ed.gov (U.S. Department of Education)
**Quality Score: 7/10**
**Reasoning:** This website serves to educate about student privacy rights and protections under laws such as FERPA. It is a credible source for information concerning educational institutions and their obligations to protect personal data. However, its scope is limited specifically to education, so while it's reliable in that context, it may not fully address broader issues of data privacy applicable to social media.

### 6. www.federalregister.gov (Federal Register)
**Quality Score: 8/10**
**Reasoning:** The Federal Register publishes government documents and notices, including laws and rules regarding various federal agencies, including privacy regulations. It is a primary source for official governmental information, making it a strong resource for understanding legal aspects of privacy and consumer protection, thus contributing to credibility.

### 7. abcnews.go.com (ABC News)
**Quality Score: 7/10**
**Reasoning:** ABC News is a well-known media outlet that provides news coverage across various topics. While it has a strong reputation, media organizations sometimes face challenges in maintaining objectivity and accuracy, especially surrounding emerging stories. However, ABC News generally uses credible sources and provides fact-checked journalism, which allows for a reasonable score in terms of reliability.

### 8. www.consumerfinance.gov (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau)
**Quality Score: 9/10**
**Reasoning:** The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a U.S. government agency that helps protect consumers in the financial sector. They provide extensive research, data, and resources on consumer rights, financial policies, and awareness about misleading practices, which enhances their credibility. They are also proactive in exposing scams and misinformation related to consumer finance.

### 9. raleighnc.gov (City of Raleigh Government)
**Quality Score: 6/10**
**Reasoning:** As a city government website, it provides local information, services, and resources, but its scope is limited to Raleigh. While it may have reliable data for local policies and actions, it does not address broader issues of fake news or misinformation. It’s useful for localized inquiries but not for investigating the claim presented.

### 10. termly.io (Termly)
**Quality Score: 6/10**
**Reasoning:** Termly provides resources related to privacy policies and compliance with laws such as GDPR and CCPA. While they offer helpful tools for understanding legal implications of online activities, their reliability may be less compared to government sources and large organizations. They are a decent resource for policy management, but not specifically known for addressing the spread of fake news.

---

Each website evaluated has strengths and weaknesses, contributing to their overall reliability and effectiveness in providing truthful information and combatting misinformation. The scores reflect their credibility in context, with government websites generally being more trustworthy than less established entities.
2024-08-02 08:23:53 - ThreadPoolExecutor-14_1 - INFO - ################## Process RelevanceScore Output (Attempt 1) ##################
2024-08-02 08:23:53 - ThreadPoolExecutor-14_1 - INFO - 1. **evidence0**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 8
   - **Justification**: This evidence outlines Meta's law enforcement guidelines, which indicate that account records may be disclosed under specific legal processes. Although it doesn't directly address the effect of posting a legal notice on social media, it implies that users do not have unilateral control over whether their content is made public. This supports the claim that simply posting a legal notice may not protect users from having their information disclosed.

2. **evidence1**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 7
   - **Justification**: The privacy policy explains how Meta collects and uses user data but does not specifically mention the implications of posting legal notices regarding control over the visibility of posts. While it reinforces the notion that user data is shared and potentially disclosed, it does not clearly affirm or deny the protective effect of a legal notice.

3. **evidence2**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 6
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses the privacy regulations imposed on Meta after legal actions. However, it focuses more on general privacy violations rather than addressing the specifics of user control over their posted content in relation to legal notices. It indicates a context where user control is limited, but doesn't tie directly to the claim.

4. **evidence3**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 2
   - **Justification**: This evidence concerns advertising standards and does not relate to user privacy or the implications of legal notices on post visibility. It does not address the question at hand.

5. **evidence4**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 1
   - **Justification**: This evidence relates to job openings and descriptions at Meta. It has no relevance to the question about legal notices and disclosure of posts.

6. **evidence5**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 5
   - **Justification**: The Instagram Terms of Use provide some information on agreements between users and Meta but do not address the concept of posting legal notices specifically. It somewhat supports the idea that use of the platform is bound by certain terms which could impact data control.

7. **evidence6**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 4
   - **Justification**: The evidence discusses Meta's privacy updates but does not specifically relate to whether legal notices can protect a user’s posts from public disclosure. It emphasizes user data usage rather than legal implications.

8. **evidence7**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 1
   - **Justification**: This evidence talks about management issues within the Stack Exchange platform, which is unrelated to Meta's privacy policies or the effectiveness of posting legal notices.

9. **evidence8**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 1
   - **Justification**: Similar to evidence 4, this evidence is about job openings and does not pertain to user privacy concerns or legal notices.

10. **evidence9**: 
    - **RelevanceScore**: 3
    - **Justification**: While this evidence discusses issues around censorship and content suppression on Meta's platforms, it does not address the protective effect of legal notices directly. It suggests a problematic relationship between content visibility and platform policies but lacks a clear answer to the claim made.  

Overall, the evidence generally supports the notion that posting a legal notice does not necessarily provide protection from the public disclosure of posts, but particularly strong evidence in this area is limited.

But where does that information come from? The information we collect comes from a variety of sources. 1 is your activity on meta product app services and hardware. Things like liking an Instagram post, playing a game on your Meta Quest 2, buying something through marketplace, or sharing fundraisers on Facebook all generate information. And sometimes businesses also share information with us like your activity on their websites. They may also share experiences you have offline like signing up for rewards card with your email address. This makes it easier for them to share promotions, product information, and other ads with you through our apps consistent with the choices you make. We know that people wanna understand and control what we do with this information. That's why we offer a number of ways to help you personalize and manage things the way you want. For example, maybe you've been shopping around for a new mattress and finally found the one. Now that your hunt is over, maybe you don't wanna see ads from certain mattress brands anymore. If so, you can go to ad preferences and hide ads from those specific advertisers or manage your ad settings more generally. Or remember that rewards card?

The man is engrossed in reading a book while the woman is focused on her phone. There is a moment where the man glances at the woman's phone before leaving the room briefly. During his absence, the woman continues to use her phone until the man returns and sits back at the table with her. At this point, the woman shows something on her phone to the man, and they both look at it together. The video concludes with the man and woman sitting together again. Throughout the video, various key frames showcase different settings with multiple characters. Key frames include two women in an art gallery, one pointing towards an object; a person interacting with a smartphone displaying 'AI Preferences'; two women walking away on a street; animated characters in an urban setting, one showing something on a mobile phone to the other; individuals taking a selfie outdoors; a scene in a store with a man behind a glass window and two women facing the window; and two women in a bedroom, one pondering while the other gazes out of a window. The video contains a series of interconnected scenes portraying interactions, technology use, and varied environments involving different characters, ultimately culminating in the central theme of connection and shared experiences between individuals in diverse settings."},

GENERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE COPPA RULE\\n-----------------------------------------\\n### 1\\\\. What is the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Rule?\\nCongress enacted the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in 1998. COPPA required the Federal Trade Commission to issue and enforce regulations concerning children\u2019s online privacy. The Commission\u2019s original COPPA Rule became effective on April 21, 2000. The Commission published an amended Rule on January 17, 2013. The amended Rule took effect on July 1, 2013.\\nThe primary goal of COPPA is to place parents in control over what information is collected from their young children online. The Rule was designed to protect children under age 13, while accounting for the dynamic nature of the Internet. The Rule applies to operators of commercial websites and online services (including mobile apps and IoT devices, such as smart toys) directed to children under 13 that collect, use, or disclose personal information from children, or on whose behalf such information is collected or maintained (such as when personal information is collected by an ad network to serve targeted advertising). The Rule also applies to operators of general audience websites or online services with actual knowledge that they are collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from children under 13, and to websites or online services that have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information directly from users of another website or online service directed to children.

For all that, there is little evidence that this type of monitoring advances security objectives; agencies rarely measure the usefulness of social media monitoring and DHS\u2019s own pilot programs showed that they were not helpful in identifying threats. Nevertheless, the use of social media for a range of purposes continues to grow.\\nIn this Q&A, we survey the ways in which federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies use social media monitoring and the risks posed by its thinly regulated and growing use in various contexts.\\nWhich federal agencies use social media monitoring?\\n---------------------------------------------------\\nMany federal agencies use social media, including the\u00a0\u00a0(DHS),\u00a0\u00a0(FBI),\u00a0\u00a0(State Department),\u00a0\u00a0(DEA),\u00a0\u00a0(ATF),\u00a0\u00a0(USPS),\u00a0\u00a0(IRS),\u00a0, and\u00a0\u00a0(SSA). This document focuses primarily on the activities of DHS, FBI, and the State Department, as the agencies that make the most extensive use of social media for monitoring, targeting, and information collection.\\nWhy do federal agencies monitor social media?\\n---------------------------------------------\\nPublicly available information shows that federal agencies use social media for four main \u2014 and sometimes overlapping \u2014 purposes. The examples below are illustrative and do not capture the full spectrum of social media surveillance by federal agencies.\\n**Investigations**: Law enforcement agencies, such as the FBI and some components of DHS, use social media monitoring to assist with criminal and civil investigations. Some of these investigations may not even require a showing of criminal activity. For example, FBI agents can open an \u201cassessment\u201d simply on the basis of an \u201cauthorized purpose,\u201d such as preventing crime or terrorism, and without a factual basis. During assessments, FBI agents can carry out searches of publicly available online information. Subsequent investigative stages, which require some factual basis, open the door for more invasive surveillance tactics, such as the monitoring and recording of chats, direct messages, and other private online communications in real time.\\nAt DHS, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) \u2014 which is part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \u2014 is the Department\u2019s \u201c.\u201d HSI\u00a0\u00a0in its training materials that it has the authority to enforce any federal law, and relies on social media when conducting investigations on matters ranging from civil immigration violations to terrorism. ICE agents can look at publicly available social media content for purposes ranging from finding fugitives to gathering evidence in support of investigations to probing \u201cpotential criminal activity,\u201d a \u201cthreat detection\u201d function discussed below. Agents can also operate undercover online and monitor private online communications, but the circumstances under which they are permitted to do so are not publicly known.\\n**Monitoring to detect threats:**\u00a0Even without opening...[Content truncated]\"\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"evidence4\": {\n            \"title\": \"FERPA | Protecting Student Privacy\",\n            \"link\": \"http://studentprivacy.ed.gov/ferpa\",\n            \"displayLink\": \"studentprivacy.ed.gov\",\n            \"snippet\": \"Subpart D\u2014May an Educational Agency or Institution Disclose Personally Identifiable Information From Education Records? \u00a799.30 Under what conditions is prior\u00a0...\",\n            \"htmlSnippet\": \"Subpart D\u2014May an Educational Agency or Institution Disclose Personally Identifiable Information From Education Records? \u00a799.30 Under what conditions <b>is</b> prior&nbsp;...\",\n            \"website_content\": \"[Content truncated]... the disclosure is in compliance with\u2014\\n(A) A Federal grand jury subpoena and the court has ordered that the existence or the contents of the subpoena or the information furnished in response to the subpoena not be disclosed;\\n(B) Any other subpoena issued for a law enforcement purpose and the court or other issuing agency has ordered that the existence or the contents of the subpoena or the information furnished in response to the subpoena not be disclosed; or\\n(C) An ex parte court order obtained by the United States Attorney General (or designee not lower than an Assistant Attorney General) concerning investigations or prosecutions of an offense listed in 18 U.S.C. 2332b(g)(5)(B) or an act of domestic or international terrorism as defined in 18 U.S.C. 2331.\\n(iii)(A) If an educational agency or institution initiates legal action against a parent or student, the educational agency or institution may disclose to the court, without a court order or subpoena, the education records of the student that are relevant for the educational agency or institution to proceed with the legal action as plaintiff.\\n(B) If a parent or eligible student initiates legal action against an educational agency or institution, the educational agency or institution may disclose to the court, without a court order or subpoena, the student's education records that are relevant for the educational agency or institution to defend itself.\\n(10) The disclosure is in connection with a health or safety emergency, under the conditions described in \u00a799.36.\\n(11) The disclosure is information the educational agency or institution has designated as \u201cdirectory information\u201d, under the conditions described in \u00a799.37.\\n(12) The disclosure is to the parent of a student who is not an eligible student or to the student.\\n(13) The disclosure, subject to the requirements in \u00a799.39, is to a victim of an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence or a non-forcible sex offense.

"Task": "Based on the information of each evidence in 'Evidences', especially the content of website_content, evaluate the relevance of this evidence to the current question (RelevanceScore, 0~10 points, provide a score). Consider how closely the evidence addresses the specifics of the question 'Does posting a legal notice on social media prevent public disclosure of user posts according to Meta's policies?', with a strong emphasis on how the evidence helps in determining whether the Claim and Video_information constitute false news. Evidence that significantly aids in judging the veracity of the Claim and Video_information should receive higher scores, while less relevant evidence should receive lower scores. The more the evidence helps in determining the truthfulness of the Claim and Video_information, the higher the RelevanceScore should be.

For each evidence (evidence0, evidence1, evidence2, evidence3, evidence4, evidence5, evidence6, evidence7, evidence8, evidence9), provide the following:
1. 'RelevanceScore': score, justification
Each evidence should include these details, specified as 'evidenceN' where N is the evidence number."

2024-08-02 08:24:07 - ThreadPoolExecutor-14_0 - INFO - Here’s an evaluation of the relevance of each evidence to the question "Does posting a legal notice on social media prevent public disclosure of user posts according to Meta's policies?":

1. **evidence0**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 1
   - **Justification**: The content discusses the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and privacy questions but does not directly relate to the idea of posting legal notices on social media or how such notices interact with personal data posted on platforms like Facebook.

2. **evidence1**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 2
   - **Justification**: This evidence focuses on privacy practices at the New Jersey state website and does not specifically address social media policies or the effectiveness of legal notices, rendering it not very relevant to the claim.

3. **evidence2**:  
   - **RelevanceScore**: 2
   - **Justification**: Similar to evidence0, this evidence talks about COPPA and its requirements but doesn't touch on the impact of posting legal notices on user privacy on social media, thus providing limited relevance.

4. **evidence3**:  
   - **RelevanceScore**: 3
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses social media surveillance by the government, touching on the public nature of social media but failing to directly connect with the claim about legal notices supposedly safeguarding posts, resulting in low relevance.

5. **evidence4**:  
   - **RelevanceScore**: 1
   - **Justification**: This evidence addresses the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and how student information can be disclosed but does not pertain to social media or the effectiveness of legal notices in preventing information sharing.

6. **evidence5**:  
   - **RelevanceScore**: 2
   - **Justification**: This evidence similarly concerns CAPPA but lacks relevance to social media policies or legal notices, making it unhelpful in assessing the claim.

7. **evidence6**:  
   - **RelevanceScore**: 10
   - **Justification**: This evidence directly addresses the misconception about copyright notices on Facebook, affirming that simply posting a legal notice does not safeguard posts or images from public disclosure according to Facebook's terms. Thus, it's highly relevant to the question.

8. **evidence7**:  
   - **RelevanceScore**: 1
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses the privacy policies of a financial service but does not address social media contexts or legal notices, leading to its low relevance.

9. **evidence8**:  
   - **RelevanceScore**: 1
   - **Justification**: This evidence revolves around a municipal website’s privacy policy and does not relate to social media privacy protocols or the effect of legal notices on post visibility.

10. **evidence9**:  
    - **RelevanceScore**: 4
    - **Justification**: This evidence discusses the purpose of disclaimers and their legal protections, implying that while they can help limit liability, they don’t effectively prevent public disclosure of posts on social media. It offers moderate, indirect support for the idea that legal notices do not serve as shields against public sharing.

Based on the evaluations, the scores reflect how directly and effectively each piece of evidence addresses the claim and its relevance to the specific question about social media privacy policies.

And sometimes businesses also share information with us like your activity on their websites. They may also share experiences you have offline like signing up for rewards card with your email address. This makes it easier for them to share promotions, product information, and other ads with you through our apps consistent with the choices you make. We know that people wanna understand and control what we do with this information. That's why we offer a number of ways to help you personalize and manage things the way you want. For example, maybe you've been shopping around for a new mattress and finally found the one. Now that your hunt is over, maybe you don't wanna see ads from certain mattress brands anymore. If so, you can go to ad preferences and hide ads from those specific advertisers or manage your ad settings more generally. Or remember that rewards card?

There is a moment where the man glances at the woman's phone before leaving the room briefly. During his absence, the woman continues to use her phone until the man returns and sits back at the table with her. At this point, the woman shows something on her phone to the man, and they both look at it together. The video concludes with the man and woman sitting together again. Throughout the video, various key frames showcase different settings with multiple characters. Key frames include two women in an art gallery, one pointing towards an object; a person interacting with a smartphone displaying 'AI Preferences'; two women walking away on a street; animated characters in an urban setting, one showing something on a mobile phone to the other; individuals taking a selfie outdoors; a scene in a store with a man behind a glass window and two women facing the window; and two women in a bedroom, one pondering while the other gazes out of a window.

It is one of the largest penalties ever assessed by the U.S. government for any violation.\nThe settlement order announced today also imposes unprecedented new restrictions on Facebook\u2019s business operations and creates multiple channels of compliance. The order requires Facebook to restructure its approach to privacy from the corporate board-level down, and establishes strong new mechanisms to ensure that Facebook executives are accountable for the decisions they make about privacy, and that those decisions are subject to meaningful oversight.\n\u201cDespite repeated promises to its billions of users worldwide that they could control how their personal information is shared, Facebook undermined consumers\u2019 choices,\u201d said FTC Chairman Joe Simons. \u201cThe magnitude of the $5 billion penalty and sweeping conduct relief are unprecedented in the history of the FTC.

2024-08-02 08:24:28 - Thread-849 (process_claim_verification) - INFO - Posting a legal notice on social media does not prevent public disclosure of user posts according to Meta's policies. Here are the reasons:

1. **Hoax Nature of Social Media Copyright Notices**: There have been widespread hoaxes about posting copyright notices on Facebook, claiming it provides protection over media shared on the platform. Meta itself has clarified that these claims are false and that simply posting a notice does not change the ownership of the content. Facebook does not own user-generated content, but users also cannot unilaterally claim copyright protections by posting a legal disclaimer on their wall [Query 1_evidence_1].

2. **Compliance with Legal Requests**: Meta’s policies state that they disclose account records in accordance with applicable laws and terms of service. This means that if requested by law enforcement or through legal processes, user content such as posts, photos, and messages may still be disclosed regardless of whether a user has tried to protect those posts with a notice [Query 2_evidence_1].

3. **Privacy and Control Mechanisms**: While Meta has mechanisms for users to manage their privacy settings, these tools do not include the efficacy of legal notices posted by users. Users can manage privacy settings and control what information they share, but these controls do not hinge on the posting of disclaimers or notices. They are instead linked to the configurations provided within the platform [Query 2_evidence_2].

**Confidence Level**: I am 90% confident in this answer based on the analysis of available evidence. The clarity in Meta's policy regarding the disclosure of user content, combined with the discrediting of hoax claims regarding copyright notices, supports the conclusion that such notices do not effectively prevent public disclosure of user posts.

But where does that information come from? The information we collect comes from a variety of sources. 1 is your activity on meta product app services and hardware. Things like liking an Instagram post, playing a game on your Meta Quest 2, buying something through marketplace, or sharing fundraisers on Facebook all generate information. And sometimes businesses also share information with us like your activity on their websites. They may also share experiences you have offline like signing up for rewards card with your email address. This makes it easier for them to share promotions, product information, and other ads with you through our apps consistent with the choices you make. We know that people wanna understand and control what we do with this information. That's why we offer a number of ways to help you personalize and manage things the way you want. For example, maybe you've been shopping around for a new mattress and finally found the one. Now that your hunt is over, maybe you don't wanna see ads from certain mattress brands anymore. If so, you can go to ad preferences and hide ads from those specific advertisers or manage your ad settings more generally. Or remember that rewards card? By signing up, you may start seeing deals for their products popping up. Using off Facebook activity, you can view a summary of the information Facebook Facebook receives about your activity on other apps and websites and choose to disconnect it from your account. When it comes to your information, we're here for you. And helping you understand how your information is collected, used, and shared is our responsibility.

During his absence, the woman continues to use her phone until the man returns and sits back at the table with her. At this point, the woman shows something on her phone to the man, and they both look at it together. The video concludes with the man and woman sitting together again. Throughout the video, various key frames showcase different settings with multiple characters. Key frames include two women in an art gallery, one pointing towards an object; a person interacting with a smartphone displaying 'AI Preferences'; two women walking away on a street; animated characters in an urban setting, one showing something on a mobile phone to the other; individuals taking a selfie outdoors; a scene in a store with a man behind a glass window and two women facing the window; and two women in a bedroom, one pondering while the other gazes out of a window.

{'Final_Judgement': {'Answer': 'False', 'Reasons': "Posting a legal notice on social media does not prevent public disclosure of user posts according to Meta's policies for several reasons. First, there is a widespread misconception that posting copyright notices on platforms like Facebook offers protection over the content shared. Meta explicitly clarifies that such claims are false and that merely posting a notice does not alter ownership of posted content, nor does it provide any legal safeguard against public disclosure. Additionally, Meta's policies indicate that user content can still be accessed and disclosed in compliance with legal requests, regardless of personal notices posted by users. Finally, while Meta provides users with mechanisms to manage their privacy settings, these are distinct from any effectiveness of legal notices, which do not influence the platform's operational policies.", 'Therefore, the Claim authenticity is': 'False', 'The information type is': 'False', 'The specific type of False Information is': 'False speech'}}
