The information we collect comes from a variety of sources. 1 is your activity on meta product app services and hardware. Things like liking an Instagram post, playing a game on your Meta Quest 2, buying something through marketplace, or sharing fundraisers on Facebook all generate information. And sometimes businesses also share information with us like your activity on their websites. They may also share experiences you have offline like signing up for rewards card with your email address. This makes it easier for them to share promotions, product information, and other ads with you through our apps consistent with the choices you make. We know that people wanna understand and control what we do with this information. That's why we offer a number of ways to help you personalize and manage things the way you want. For example, maybe you've been shopping around for a new mattress and finally found the one. Now that your hunt is over, maybe you don't wanna see ads from certain mattress brands anymore. If so, you can go to ad preferences and hide ads from those specific advertisers or manage your ad settings more generally. Or remember that rewards card? By signing up, you may start seeing deals for their products popping up. Using off Facebook activity, you can view a summary of the information Facebook Facebook receives about your activity on other apps and websites and choose to disconnect it from your account. When it comes to your information, we're here for you. And helping you understand how your information is collected, used, and shared is our responsibility. So whether you're messaging, posting, shopping, liking, or sharing, we're committed to helping you have the best experience possible across all of our apps and products.",
        "Video_descriptor": "The video opens with a scene featuring a man and a woman seated at a table in an indoor setting. The man is engrossed in reading a book while the woman is focused on her phone. There is a moment where the man glances at the woman's phone before leaving the room briefly. During his absence, the woman continues to use her phone until the man returns and sits back at the table with her. At this point, the woman shows something on her phone to the man, and they both look at it together. The video concludes with the man and woman sitting together again. Throughout the video, various key frames showcase different settings with multiple characters. Key frames include two women in an art gallery, one pointing towards an object; a person interacting with a smartphone displaying 'AI Preferences'; two women walking away on a street; animated characters in an urban setting, one showing something on a mobile phone to the other; individuals taking a selfie outdoors; a scene in a store with a man behind a glass window and two women facing the window; and two women in a bedroom, one pondering while the other gazes out of a window. The video contains a series of interconnected scenes portraying interactions, technology use, and varied environments involving different characters, ultimately culminating in the central theme of connection and shared experiences between individuals in diverse settings."

    "Initial_Question_Generation": {
        "Question": "Does posting a legal notice on social media prevent public disclosure of user posts according to Meta's policies?",
        "Answer": "Posting a legal notice on social media does not prevent public disclosure of user posts according to Meta's policies. Here are the reasons:\n\n1. **Hoax Nature of Social Media Copyright Notices**: There have been widespread hoaxes about posting copyright notices on Facebook, claiming it provides protection over media shared on the platform. Meta itself has clarified that these claims are false and that simply posting a notice does not change the ownership of the content. Facebook does not own user-generated content, but users also cannot unilaterally claim copyright protections by posting a legal disclaimer on their wall.\n\n2. **Compliance with Legal Requests**: Metaâ€™s policies state that they disclose account records in accordance with applicable laws and terms of service. This means that if requested by law enforcement or through legal processes, user content such as posts, photos, and messages may still be disclosed regardless of whether a user has tried to protect those posts with a notice.\n\n3. **Privacy and Control Mechanisms**: While Meta has mechanisms for users to manage their privacy settings, these tools do not include the efficacy of legal notices posted by users. Users can manage privacy settings and control what information they share, but these controls do not hinge on the posting of disclaimers or notices. They are instead linked to the configurations provided within the platform.",

    "CVResult": {
        "Judgment": "Yes",
        "Confidence": "90%",
        "Reason": "The existing information is sufficient to determine the truthfulness of the claim because it directly addresses the efficacy of posting a legal notice on social media platforms like Facebook. According to the QA_CONTEXTS, it is explicitly stated that posting a legal notice does not prevent public disclosure of user posts, as Meta has clarified that such notices are ineffective against their policies regarding content ownership and legal requests. The video information reaffirms that Meta collects and manages user data and interactions in accordance with their privacy settings, but not through user-posted legal disclaimers. Thus, the claim that posting a legal notice will protect user posts from public disclosure is false, and the provided evidence supports this conclusion."
    },
    "Final_Judgement": {
        "Answer": "False",
        "Reasons": "Posting a legal notice on social media does not prevent public disclosure of user posts according to Meta's policies for several reasons. First, there is a widespread misconception that posting copyright notices on platforms like Facebook offers protection over the content shared. Meta explicitly clarifies that such claims are false and that merely posting a notice does not alter ownership of posted content, nor does it provide any legal safeguard against public disclosure. Additionally, Meta's policies indicate that user content can still be accessed and disclosed in compliance with legal requests, regardless of personal notices posted by users. Finally, while Meta provides users with mechanisms to manage their privacy settings, these are distinct from any effectiveness of legal notices, which do not influence the platform's operational policies.",
