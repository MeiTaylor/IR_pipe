It shows the athlete’s skill level and athleticism, and it helps coaches figure out who might be the right athletic fit for their team. There’s a lot riding on an athlete’s recruiting video, so families need to take the time to really understand what coaches are looking for, how to capture the right footage and what it takes to put the finished product together.\nQuick Links\n-----------\nHow to make a volleyball skills video\n-------------------------------------\nFrom making a great first impression to remaining on a coach’s radar, a women’s volleyball skills video is key to getting noticed. The best part of a volleyball skills video is that it doesn’t need to be as polished as a traditional highlight video.\nAccording to former D1 volleyball coach Jason Holt volleyball recruits should include drills that demonstrate speed, power and agility to ball control, setting footwork and consistent, solid reps. And finally, your commitment to the game. “They want to see how hard you work,” he said. “Are you a hard worker? Do you show that volleyball passion about playing at the next level?”\nHow to use volleyball highlight videos in your recruiting\n---------------------------------------------------------\nAn athlete’s recruiting video—also referred to as a volleyball highlight video—should be the first thing that they send college coaches when they contact them. If the coach likes what they see, they might request full game footage or more clips. At the very least, it will encourage the coach to strike up a conversation to learn more about who the recruit is as a student-athlete if the coach’s interest is piqued by the video.\nGenerally, coaches will watch the first 10–25 seconds of a recruit’s volleyball highlight video and have a good idea of if they are interested in pursuing that recruit. So, make those first 10–25 seconds extremely impactful. Families should put their best footage at the beginning to really capture the coach’s attention right away.\n**Volleyball recruiting tip**: Many recruits make the mistake of creating one volleyball recruiting video—and then stopping! Instead, families should create a new video after every major tournament (such as a national...[Content truncated]",

At long last, I can finally play my favorite sport in the comfort of my own home without facing the stigma that comes with dropping hours into Dead or Alive Xtreme 3. (Why is it so hard to make a good volleyball video game that isn't about women wearing the smallest swimsuits possible?) That said, I wish my teammates better understood what they were doing when playing the game, specifically when it comes to blocking.\nSo here I am, on my hands and knees (because you failed to help me stop the ball and that means I had to dive for it) begging for y'all to start read blocking--using data pulled from observations of your opponent to limit how well a spiker can hit the ball as opposed to outright stopping it. It will make life so much easier for your partner when they're preparing to receive the ball and bump it up.\nNintendo puts a greater level of importance on blocking (jumping up to stop a spike) than it should, given how it's framed volleyball in Switch Sports' Volleyball mode. Traditionally, two-versus-two volleyball is played on a beach, where sand balances out the lack of available receivers (defending players responsible for bumping up the ball so that it can be set) by restricting a spiker's jump height (and thus the available places they can easily hit the ball to). Switch Sports, however, opts for indoor volleyball, which is traditionally played three-versus-three or six-versus-six. Getting...[Content truncated]",

I’m trying to pack and do laundry to leave for Tampa while also finding out that I was drafted #1 overall in the Pro Volleyball Federation and that my new home would be in Ohio. Really thinking that I’m going to be a part of the first inaugural season of the first pro volleyball league in America is huge. Then the first pick??? It’s crazy. While processing that, I’m thinking about how I’m going to be with the national team this summer trying to fight to make an Olympic roster spot. \nI’m grateful I really am. I’m proud of myself. And at the same time I’m not satisfied yet. Because I know there is more work to be done. \nWith my college career being over, I started to sit and think about what it takes to be a Longhorn. It takes a different type of person, the mindset, the personality. It’s the reason our fans support us how they do. Nothing compares to Longhorn fans — you ride for us, you care about us, you always believed in me. You stood beside this team no matter what.\nTo the coaches and staff, I can never say thank you enough. You took an 18 year old girl and allowed her to become the most authentic version of herself. This program is a family, one that I’m so thankful that I chose. \nTwo national championships later, I won’t say I’m a Longhorn legend. On paper others will say that I am, Jerritt said if I went back to back that I'm in the record books forever. I’ll just say that I love the University of Texas and whenever y’all want me there, I’ll be there. And if y’all say I’m a Longhorn legend then it’s an honor I’ll wear forever.\nFor Quinn Ewers, it’s always been Texas:  “I’m getting a chance to create my own legacy with the Longhorns.”\nJermaine O’Neal is in the building! Quentin and Darius welcome the six-time NBA All-Star to the Knuckleheads podcast. \nThis story is not about Vince Young. This is about Bubba. This is about the Baby Boy. This is about Vincent. You never heard this one before.\n© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved",

My child is (honestly, not a parent talking) the best player they have. He can set, hit, block, serve and pass (consistently) and has wanted his whole life to grow up and try out for the Olympic team. He works every chance he gets on perfecting his skills. Unfortunately, the coaches have decided that his dream is not valid and told him last night that, “you don’t stand a chance on making the Men’s National Team because you are not tall enough.” He is 6’1” right now and will probably get another three inches max. He came home from practice last night and had he been six instead of 16, he would have curled up in my lap and cried.\nDear Parent,\nThe Olympic dream is one we all seek in principle and conduct for our children – Citius, Altius, Fortius is a way to live life, not just play volleyball, always seeking to improve and do your personal best. I am sorry to hear that some coach, who is not with the national team, was so inflated with his/her expertise, to make such a statement. Any coach who says such should consider not coaching, or having kids – for in the desire to be an expert, they are stepping on the spirits and souls of developing quality humans.

                    "content": "ORLANDO, Fla. — Broadly, there are two kinds of college football video game players: those who drifted away from gaming when the NCAA Football franchise went away and those that have continued to play Madden for their up-to-date football video game fix. I played every NCAA Football and Madden from 2002 to 2014, then got out of gaming after college.\nAdvertisement\nLast week at EA Sports’ office in Orlando, I was back at the controls as part of a small group of reporters and YouTube creators invited to tour the studio, meet the developers, test the game and get a rundown of what to expect in all the other game modes for both Madden and College Football 25. After 11 years away, the college football game is coming back this July, and the people who make the game emphasized that this game is for all of FBS college football. Playing the game makes that very clear.\nIn the years since the game’s production was halted by fears of further litigation over the NCAA’s name, image and likeness restrictions, I did not play College Football Revamped, the online modern update of NCAA 14, but EA did hire people from that team to work on this game. I have periodically played the recent Madden games and consulted with my gaming friends on their feelings and concerns about modern gameplay coming into this.\n\nTo cut to the chase and get to what they and everyone else really want to know: Playing College Football 25 was very fun.

I wanted to start with looking at the future of some aspects of game design, and particularly – in the context of the previous column – looking at the kinds of things that have been hoped for or predicted in the past, and have not yet come to be. \nLet's start with Warren Spector's “One City Block RPG” idea. What is it, and will we ever see it? Fullbright's Steve Gaynor and a number of devs from Arkane contribute to the discussion that follows, and try to explain the persistent appeal of the One City Block idea as an ideal in game design.\n\nWarren Spector, the designer who led the original Deus Ex project, has said on a number of occasions that he'd ideally like to make an RPG/immersive sim that took place entirely within one city block: \"My ultimate dream is for someone to be foolish enough to give me the money to make what I call the One Block Role-Playing Game, where we simulate one building, one city block perfectly.\" Recently he raised the idea when talking to The Guardian newspaper in the UK, when he said \"I really want deep worlds that you can interact with. My ideal game would be one city block - some day I’m going to make that.” \nIt's a fascinating idea: the notion that if an environment was detailed enough, with comparable interactions to a real city block, with all its people, mantelpieces, and cockroaches, then it could sustain an entire game at quite a...[Content truncated]",
