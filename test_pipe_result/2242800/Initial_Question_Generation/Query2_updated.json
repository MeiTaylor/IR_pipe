This is the one,' \" Shores said. \"We all just said, \u2018Oh, it turned out really good. This is good.' But we kind of say that about all of the stuff we do.

There's one in India that ripped it off and one in Spain that ripped it off, and they each have millions of views on it. It was weird. It\u2019s like this is so crazy that this is real.
