I played every NCAA Football and Madden from 2002 to 2014, then got out of gaming after college.\nAdvertisement\nLast week at EA Sports’ office in Orlando, I was back at the controls as part of a small group of reporters and YouTube creators invited to tour the studio, meet the developers, test the game and get a rundown of what to expect in all the other game modes for both Madden and College Football 25. After 11 years away, the college football game is coming back this July, and the people who make the game emphasized that this game is for all of FBS college football. Playing the game makes that very clear.\nIn the years since the game’s production was halted by fears of further litigation over the NCAA’s name, image and likeness restrictions, I did not play College Football Revamped, the online modern update of NCAA 14, but EA did hire people from that team to work on this game. I have periodically played the recent Madden games and consulted with my gaming friends on their feelings and concerns about modern gameplay coming into this.\n\nTo cut to the chase and get to what they and everyone else really want to know: Playing College Football 25 was very fun.

I’m trying to pack and do laundry to leave for Tampa while also finding out that I was drafted #1 overall in the Pro Volleyball Federation and that my new home would be in Ohio. Really thinking that I’m going to be a part of the first inaugural season of the first pro volleyball league in America is huge. Then the first pick??? It’s crazy. While processing that, I’m thinking about how I’m going to be with the national team this summer trying to fight to make an Olympic roster spot. \nI’m grateful I really am. I’m proud of myself. And at the same time I’m not satisfied yet. Because I know there is more work to be done. \nWith my college career being over, I started to sit and think about what it takes to be a Longhorn. It takes a different type of person, the mindset, the personality. It’s the reason our fans support us how they do. Nothing compares to Longhorn fans — you ride for us, you care about us, you always believed in me. You stood beside this team no matter what.\nTo the coaches and staff, I can never say thank you enough. You took an 18 year old girl and allowed her to become the most authentic version of herself. This program is a family, one that I’m so thankful that I chose. \nTwo national championships later, I won’t say I’m a Longhorn legend. On paper others will say that I am, Jerritt said if I went back to back that I'm in the record books forever. I’ll just say that I love the University of Texas and whenever y’all want me there, I’ll be there. And if y’all say I’m a Longhorn legend then it’s an honor I’ll wear forever.\nFor Quinn Ewers, it’s always been Texas:  “I’m getting a chance to create my own legacy with the Longhorns.”\nJermaine O’Neal is in the building! Quentin and Darius welcome the six-time NBA All-Star to the Knuckleheads podcast. \nThis story is not about Vince Young. This is about Bubba. This is about the Baby Boy. This is about Vincent.

    "QA": {
        "Question": "Does the video accurately represent real footage from a professional volleyball game?",
        "Answer": "The video \"Best Volleyball Blocks Ever with Scott Sterling - Studio C\" does not accurately represent real footage from a professional volleyball game. Instead, it features a fictional character named Scott Sterling, portrayed in a comedic sketch by the show Studio C. The transcript indicates that the video is scripted and includes exaggerated commentary and comedic elements, suggesting it is not actual sports coverage but rather a parody or comedy routine. Further evidence supports that Scott Sterling is not a real person but a fictional character created for entertainment purposes. This is highlighted in articles that mention Matt Meese, the actor behind the character, being referred to as the \"most famous fake volleyball player on the Internet\". Additionally, the Wikipedia page for Scott Sterling clarifies that it refers to a fictional athlete. Lastly, the video itself is uploaded as a part of a comedic series, with no claims of showcasing real volleyball matches. The comedic tone and context of the video support its nature as an entertainment piece rather than a legitimate sports highlight. Based on this analysis, the answer to the question is clear: The video does not accurately represent real footage from a professional volleyball game, as it is a comedy sketch featuring a fictional scenario.",
