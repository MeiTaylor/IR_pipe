    "Reason": "The provided evidence does not directly link the shooting of the black Trump supporter in Chicago to the protests mentioned in the video. The first evidence discusses Trump's return to Chicago after the events of 2016, while the second evidence describes the protests that occurred at Trump's rally in Chicago but does not mention a shooting incident. Neither piece of evidence establishes a direct connection between a specific shooting of a Trump supporter and the protests."

  "Claim": "A black supporter of Donald Trump was shot and killed by protesters in Chicago.",
  "Video_information": {"video_date": 20160312.0, "platform": "foxnews", "video_headline": "Trump protester escorted out of Ohio rally", "video_transcript": "We wanna bring you, some additional updates to what's been happening with Donald Trump today. There were some tense moments earlier for mister Trump where he was speaking to 1,000 at another rally in Ohio. I have to do it myself. I know it's not. And as you can see, Secret Service agents were responding very quickly to what was seen as some kind of potential threat at the rally near Dayton, Ohio. Agents jumping on the stage surrounding the republican front runner and aft this is after someone in that crowd apparently got too close. And you see that video there. That's new video just a short time ago that brought to us after that on stage incident showing Secret Service agents escorting a protester out of that Ohio event.", "Video_descriptor": "The video opens with a news anchorwoman reporting on a story, setting the stage for the unfolding events. A man in a suit and tie is then depicted walking down a set of stairs, exuding a sense of purpose and authority. The scene transitions to a large outdoor gathering where another man in a suit and tie is engaging with the crowd, shaking hands and interacting with enthusiasm. This man later ascends a set of stairs onto a stage, where he delivers a speech, capturing the audience's attention with his presence and words. The video culminates as the man descends the stairs, perhaps symbolizing a conclusion or a shift in focus. The key frames provide additional context, showcasing a political rally environment with prominent visuals such as a 'TRUMP' signage and a large aircraft in the background, indicative of a significant public event. The presence of security personnel and Secret Service agents underscores the importance and potential risks associated with the gathering, amplifying the intensity and gravity of the situation. Overall, the video captures the essence of a dynamic and charged political event, punctuated by the charismatic presence of the central figure and the accompanying elements of security and public engagement."},

  "Task": "Determine if online information searching is needed to answer the new question. Consider the following criteria:

1. Online search is generally recommended for most questions to provide comprehensive and up-to-date information.
2. If the question can be fully and confidently answered using only the given 'Claim', 'Video_information', and 'QA_CONTEXTS', online search may not be necessary.
3. If the question specifically asks about details or content exclusively present in the video, online search may not be needed.
4. For any question that could benefit from additional context, background, or current information, online search is recommended.

Based on these criteria, determine if online search is needed (Yes or No). If online search could potentially provide any useful information or context, even if not strictly necessary, choose 'Yes'. Only choose 'No' if the question is entirely about specific video content that cannot be found online.

If the result is 'Yes', generate two new queries for Google Custom Search API. If 'No', do not provide any queries.

If generating queries:
- Ensure Query 1 and Query 2 focus on different aspects of the question and are not repetitive.
- Each query should be concise (not exceeding 10 words) and suitable for Google Custom Search API.
- Provide key terms that represent the core focus of each specific query. Key terms must be a single word.

Note: The generated queries should be phrases suitable for Google Search.

    "Reason": "The existing information includes a snippet from a video transcript where Hillary Clinton states, 'we didn't lose a single person in Libya.' However, the claim revolves around her overlooking the Benghazi victims, which is a more complex situation involving specific events, including the Benghazi attack that occurred in 2012. The phrase in the transcript does not provide context about the Benghazi incident or acknowledge the deaths that occurred there. Therefore, while the quote regarding Libya is clear, the information does not explicitly confirm or deny whether she was overlooking the victims from Benghazi or the context surrounding these statements. As such, while there is relevant information about her statements on Libya, we lack definitive context regarding the Benghazi attack and her awareness or acknowledgment of the victims involved."

  "Task": "Determine if online information searching is needed to answer the new question. Consider the following criteria:

1. Online search is generally recommended for most questions to provide comprehensive and up-to-date information.
2. If the question can be fully and confidently answered using only the given 'Claim', 'Video_information', and 'QA_CONTEXTS', online search may not be necessary.
3. If the question specifically asks about details or content exclusively present in the video, online search may not be needed.
4. For any question that could benefit from additional context, background, or current information, online search is recommended.

Based on these criteria, determine if online search is needed (Yes or No). If online search could potentially provide any useful information or context, even if not strictly necessary, choose 'Yes'. Only choose 'No' if the question is entirely about specific video content that cannot be found online.

If the result is 'Yes', generate two new queries for Google Custom Search API. If 'No', do not provide any queries.

If generating queries:
- Ensure Query 1 and Query 2 focus on different aspects of the question and are not repetitive.
- Each query should be concise (not exceeding 10 words) and suitable for Google Custom Search API.
- Provide key terms that represent the core focus of each specific query. Key terms must be a single word.

Note: The generated queries should be phrases suitable for Google Search.
