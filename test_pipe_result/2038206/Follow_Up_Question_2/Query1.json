Perceiving one’s sexual organs to be below ideal standards can jeopardize a man’s self-confidence. Some men experience distress whether they have a micropenis or even an average-sized penis.6 Exposure to media and internet materials has contributed to unrealistic expectations in recent years.7,8 This has led to feelings of inadequacy and discomfort among men not at peace with their bodies.9 Various studies have shown that nearly half of men are dissatisfied with the size of their penises and are willing to have larger ones, despite meeting normal physical and anatomic parameters.10,11 Aesthetic procedures for male genitalia have become an integral and essential part of aesthetic surgery worldwide, with a global penile enlargement surgery rate of 8.0%.12,13\nWidespread negative attitudes toward body and appearance among men have been identified, and negative body attitudes are associated with negative sexual experiences.14 Performance anxiety related to feelings of inadequacy is the most common sexual problem experienced by men. Premature ejaculation (PE) stands out as one of the most prevalent sexual dysfunctions in men, affecting all age groups, with a prevalence of 20% to 30%.15-17 The prevalence of PE in our country, Turkey, varies between 20% and 25%.18,19 PE affects not only the individual but also the partner, leading to psychological stress and a loss of self-confidence, negatively affecting the quality of life.17 Although there are studies on the prevalence of sexual dysfunctions in men in Turkey, these studies report different results, but it is also seen that these problems are common.20 In Turkish culture, the penis is a tool for measuring masculinity and masculinity.21 Penis size is considered a symbol of masculinity, and having a large penis has been associated with increased self-confidence.22 Many Turkish men attach great importance to their penis size. Despite numerous studies on genital self-image in women, limited information exists in the literature regarding men’s attitudes toward their sexual organs and how they affect PE. This study aims to identify factors influencing men’s genital self-image and the relationship between genital self-image and PE.\nMethods\n-------\nThis descriptive and correlational study was conducted at the urology clinic of a state hospital, which serves a potential population of approximately 100 000 to 120 000, with a total population of 78 402.

An online, questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study involving 376 circumcised men 20 to 40&nbsp;years of age in Taiwan was conducted. Circumcision-related satisfaction was defined as a visual analogue scale score ≥ 6 (range, 1–10). Pearson’s chi-square test was performed to compare differences between satisfied and unsatisfied participants. Factors predictive of participant satisfaction were analysed using multivariate logistic regression. Statistical significance was set at P &lt; 0.05. Among 376 circumcised men, 249 (66.2%) reported satisfaction with circumcision. Satisfied participants had higher levels of education, underwent circumcision for phimosis or balanitis, underwent circumcision during adulthood, reported a larger penile size, and had fewer long-term complaints. Furthermore, 89.4% had various long-term complaints, including skin colour mismatch, changes in masturbation methods, hypertrophic scarring, ex",

Multivariate analysis revealed that adult circumcision and the absence of long-term conditions were predictive of satisfaction. Two-thirds of participants were satisfied with their circumcision outcome, especially those who underwent circumcision for phimosis or balanitis during adulthood. Proper preoperative patient selection and postoperative symptom prevention would improve patient satisfaction.\nMale circumcision, a common procedure worldwide, involves the removal of the foreskin of the penis1. Indications for this procedure include phimosis, dyspareunia, balanitis, and concurrent phimosis and balanitis2. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States released recommendations promoting male circumcision as public health and preventive measure against sexually transmitted diseases3. The World Health Organization announced that voluntary medical male circumcision is effective for preventing human immunodeficiency virus infection; therefore, it recommended that men living in high-risk areas should undergo circumcision4. However, some males undergo circumcision for religious or cosmetic reasons. We hypothesised that because males have different reasons for circumcision, they also have different expectations regarding the outcome and that these expectations affect patient satisfaction. Understanding the predictive factors associated with postoperative satisfaction is crucial for patient selection and counselling before circumcision; however, there is limited information regarding the relationship between circumcision and patient satisfaction.\nMoreover, there are several myths surrounding male circumcision, including the belief that the penis would become larger in size, and that the ejaculatory latency time would increase after circumcision. We investigated subjective perceptions of changes in penile length and ejaculatory latency time after circumcision as well as the prevalence of long-term complaints, such as skin colour mismatch, among circumcised men to facilitate appropriate patient selection and improve patient counselling.\nA total of 376 men were included in this study. Of the participants, 249 (66.2%) reported satisfaction with the outcome of circumcision; however, the remaining 127 (33.8%) felt unsatisfied (Table 1). Phimosis and balanitis, cosmetic reasons or premature ejaculation, and being forced by their parents were reasons for circumcision for 220 (58.5%), 95 (25.3%), and 125 (33.2%) patients, respectively. After circumcision, 175 participants (46.5%) subjectively perceived that their penis had become longer, and 86 (22.9%) reported that they had a longer ejaculatory latency time. Nearly 90% of the participants reported some sort of long-term complaints, including skin colour mismatch (50.3%), changes in masturbation methods (33.0%), hypertrophic scarring (...[Content truncated]",

                    "content": "[Content truncated]... results support the hypothesis that female mate choice could have driven the evolution of larger penises in humans. More broadly, our results show that precopulatory sexual selection can play a role in the evolution of genital traits.\nMale genitalia show great variation among closely related species (1). This variation is typically attributed to copulatory and postcopulatory sexual selection to increase male fertilization success under sperm competition (2) or cryptic female choice (3). There might, however, also be premating sexual selection on male genitalia. Precopulatory processes can influence genital morphology (4, 5), but it is unknown whether these results are due to direct female choice or sexual conflict. In species where genitalia are externally visible, sexual selection might also act if females prefer males with specific genital morphology. Despite this potential effect, relatively little research has tested whether primary sexual characters influence male attractiveness (6–8).\nHow female choice acts on any given male trait, and hence the strength and direction of selection, can be influenced by several, nonmutually exclusive factors. First, females use multiple cues during the mate choice process (9). Overall male attractiveness is unlikely to be determined by individual traits (e.g., refs. 10 and 11), so manipulating traits in isolation can lead to faulty conclusions about net male attractiveness (but see also ref. 12). Second, traits within individuals are phenotypically and genetically correlated. These relationships can influence evolution via correlational selection (13). Third, there might be a size contrast effect such that female assessment of attractiveness varies if the trait of interest is viewed differently in relation to other traits, analogous to the Ebbinghaus–Titchener effect (14). For example, the same sized penis might be perceived differently on short and tall men. Finally, a female’s own phenotype might influence her mate choice decisions. Humans mate assortatively based on numerous traits, including height (15), facial symmetry (16), and body shape (17, 18). Hence, it is likely that how a female rates a male’s attractiveness will partly depend upon her own phenotype.\nThe upright body posture and protruding, nonretractable genitalia of male humans make the penis particularly conspicuous, even when flaccid. This observation has generated suggestions by evolutionary biologists that the comparatively large human penis evolved under premating sexual selection (19, 20). Furthermore, novels, magazines, and popular articles often allude to the existence of a relationship between penis size and sexual attractiveness or masculinity (21, 22). Many cultures have fashion items,...[Content truncated]",

Some environmental factors in addition to genetics, such as the presence of endocrine disruptors, can affect penis growth.\n\nWhile results vary slightly across reputable studies, the consensus is that the mean human penis, when erect, is in the range 12.9–15 cm (5.1–5.9 in) in length.[3][5][6]\n\nA 2015 systematic review published by Veale et al. of medical research on the topic over the previous 30 years published in BJU International showed similar results, giving mean flaccid, stretched non-erect, and erect lengths of 9.16 cm, 13.24 cm, and 13.12 cm respectively, and mean flaccid and erect circumferences of 9.31 cm and 11.66 cm respectively. Erect lengths in the included studies were measured by pushing the pre-pubic fat pad to the bone, and flaccid or erect girth (circumference) was measured at the base or mid-shaft of the penis.[2]\n\nThe meta-analysis and systematic review by Belladelli et al. (2023) of 55,761 men from 75 studies, done between 1942 and 2021, and based on estimations of pooled mean length, indicated that the average erect penis length was 13.93 centimetres (5.48 in), average stretched penis length was 12.93 centimetres (5.09 in), and average flaccid penis length was 8.70 centimetres (3.43 in).[4] Belladelli (2023) indicated that \"all measurements showed variation by geographic region.

Yet, there has been little research among men who have sex with men assessing the association between penis size and social-sexual health. Survey data from a diverse sample of 1,065 men who have sex with men were used to explore the association between perceived penis size and a variety of psychosocial outcomes. Seven percent of men felt their penis was “below average,” 53.9% “average,” and 35.5% “above average.” Penis size was positively related to satisfaction with size and inversely related to lying about penis size (all p < .01). Size was unrelated to condom use, frequency of sex partners, HIV status, or recent diagnoses of HBV, HCV, gonorrhea/Chlamydia/urinary tract infections, and syphilis. Men with above average penises were more likely to report HPV and HSV-2 (Fisher’s exact p ≤ .05). Men with below average penises were significantly more likely to identify as “bottoms” (anal receptive) and men with above average penises were significantly more likely to identify as tops (anal insertive). Finally, men with below average penises fared significantly worse than other men on three measures of psychosocial adjustment. Though most men felt their penis size was average, many fell outside this “norm.” The disproportionate number of viral skin-to-skin STIs (HSV-2 and HPV...[Content truncated]",

Despite pop cultural notions regarding the importance of penis size, and Western cultural notions more broadly regarding masculinity and the penis, little research has been done on men’s perceptions of penis size, and no work has been done on gay men’s perceptions of penis size. This article presents the results of three separate qualitative research projects conducted by the authors with openly gay men that considered body image and masculinity in the lives of gay men. Noteworthy is that all of the studies were conducted using the same methodology and data analysis procedures.
