Perceiving one’s sexual organs to be below ideal standards can jeopardize a man’s self-confidence. Some men experience distress whether they have a micropenis or even an average-sized penis.6 Exposure to media and internet materials has contributed to unrealistic expectations in recent years.7,8 This has led to feelings of inadequacy and discomfort among men not at peace with their bodies.9 Various studies have shown that nearly half of men are dissatisfied with the size of their penises and are willing to have larger ones, despite meeting normal physical and anatomic parameters.10,11 Aesthetic procedures for male genitalia have become an integral and essential part of aesthetic surgery worldwide, with a global penile enlargement surgery rate of 8.0%.12,13\nWidespread negative attitudes toward body and appearance among men have been identified, and negative body attitudes are associated with negative sexual experiences.14 Performance anxiety related to feelings of inadequacy is the most common sexual problem experienced by men. Premature ejaculation (PE) stands out as one of the most prevalent sexual dysfunctions in men, affecting all age groups, with a prevalence of 20% to 30%.15-17 The prevalence of PE in our country, Turkey, varies between 20% and 25%.18,19 PE affects not only the individual but also the partner, leading to psychological stress and a loss of self-confidence, negatively affecting the quality of life.17 Although there are studies on the prevalence of sexual dysfunctions in men in Turkey, these studies report different results, but it is also seen that these problems are common.20 In Turkish culture, the penis is a tool for measuring masculinity and masculinity.21 Penis size is considered a symbol of masculinity, and having a large penis has been associated with increased self-confidence.22 Many Turkish men attach great importance to their penis size. Despite numerous studies on genital self-image in women, limited information exists in the literature regarding men’s attitudes toward their sexual organs and how they affect PE.

Multivariate analysis revealed that adult circumcision and the absence of long-term conditions were predictive of satisfaction. Two-thirds of participants were satisfied with their circumcision outcome, especially those who underwent circumcision for phimosis or balanitis during adulthood. Proper preoperative patient selection and postoperative symptom prevention would improve patient satisfaction.\nMale circumcision, a common procedure worldwide, involves the removal of the foreskin of the penis1. Indications for this procedure include phimosis, dyspareunia, balanitis, and concurrent phimosis and balanitis2. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States released recommendations promoting male circumcision as public health and preventive measure against sexually transmitted diseases3. The World Health Organization announced that voluntary medical male circumcision is effective for preventing human immunodeficiency virus infection; therefore, it recommended that men living in high-risk areas should undergo circumcision4. However, some males undergo circumcision for religious or cosmetic reasons. We hypothesised that because males have different reasons for circumcision, they also have different expectations regarding the outcome and that these expectations affect patient satisfaction. Understanding the predictive factors associated with postoperative satisfaction is crucial for patient selection and counselling before circumcision; however, there is limited information regarding the relationship between circumcision and patient satisfaction.\nMoreover, there are several myths surrounding male circumcision, including the belief that the penis would become larger in size, and that the ejaculatory latency time would increase after circumcision. We investigated subjective perceptions of changes in penile length and ejaculatory latency time after circumcision as well as the prevalence of long-term complaints, such as skin colour mismatch, among circumcised men to facilitate appropriate patient selection and improve patient counselling.\nA total of 376 men were included in this study. Of the participants, 249 (66.2%) reported satisfaction with the outcome of circumcision; however, the remaining 127 (33.8%) felt unsatisfied (Table 1). Phimosis and balanitis, cosmetic reasons or premature ejaculation, and being forced by their parents were reasons for circumcision for 220 (58.5%), 95 (25.3%), and 125 (33.2%) patients, respectively. After circumcision, 175 participants (46.5%) subjectively perceived that their penis had become longer, and 86 (22.9%) reported that they had a longer ejaculatory latency time. Nearly 90% of the participants reported some sort of long-term complaints, including skin colour mismatch (50.3%), changes in masturbation methods (33.0%), hypertrophic scarring (...[Content truncated]",

These individuals worry that their penis is too small or that others will judge them for its size.\nSome doctors refer to small penis syndrome as penile dysmorphic disorder (PDD), but the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) does not list PDD as a separate disorder. Instead, it includes PDD as a variant of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD).\nPeople with small penis syndrome or PDD do not have an unusually small penis. Instead, they are severely anxious about their penis size.\nHaving a small penis is not a medical diagnosis. Very rarely, a person’s penis is small enough to interfere with sexual functioning, and doctors will refer to it as a micropenis. People with a micropenis have a penis that is at least 2.5 standard deviations smaller than the average penis.\nPDD is a type of BDD, which is a disorder that distorts a person’s perception of their body. BDD can trigger immense anxiety in a person about their appearance.\nPeople with PDD feel shame and anxiety about penis size. They may mistakenly believe that they have a micropenis, even when their penis size is normal.\nEstimates on average penis size vary. Many people believe that a typical penis is 6 inches (in) long, but this is false and misleading, potentially triggering anxiety in those who worry about having a small penis.\nA 2014 analysis of data from 15,521 men discovered the following about penis size:\nOther research has sought to quantify what counts as a micropenis. A 2014 study defined a micropenis as a penis that is less than 7 cm (about 2.75 in) in length when flaccid and stretched.\nFurthermore, research on more than 52,000 heterosexual men and woman found that 85 percent of women were satisfied with the size of their partner’s penis. In comparison, only 55 percent of men were satisfied with their penis size.\nIt is common for people to occasionally worry that their penis might not be large enough, especially when they feel pressure from the media and from seeing larger male genitals in pornography.\nHowever, people with small penis syndrome obsessively worry about penis size.\nSome symptoms of small penis syndrome or PDD include:\nSome people with small penis syndrome have other symptoms...[Content truncated]",

This study aims to identify factors influencing men’s genital self-image and the relationship between genital self-image and PE.\nMethods\n-------\nThis descriptive and correlational study was conducted at the urology clinic of a state hospital, which serves a potential population of approximately 100 000 to 120 000, with a total population of 78 402. The hospital comprises 11 departments, an emergency service, 112 emergency health services, and 10 dialysis machines. The sample size calculation was determined as 155 individuals for a medium-sized effect, ...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What alternative factors, aside from digit ratios, might influence perceptions of penis size in men?",
        "Answer": "There are several alternative factors, aside from digit ratios, that might influence perceptions of penis size in men:\n\n1. **Sociocultural Influences**: Societal standards and cultural beliefs play a significant role in shaping how men perceive their own penis size. Men are often influenced by media representations and peer comparisons, which can create unrealistic expectations and standards of size. For example, exposure to jokes and media that mock small penis size can lead to feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction among men, even if their size is within the normal range.\n\n2. **Psychological Factors**: The way a man views his body can significantly impact his self-esteem and confidence. Research highlights that negative attitudes towards one's body, including perceptions of penis size, can lead to performance anxiety and distress. Men who perceive their penis as smaller than ideal are more likely to experience sexual dysfunctions and feelings of inadequacy. This suggests that psychological factors, including body image and critical self-assessment, can strongly influence perceptions of penis size.\n\n3. **Peer Comparisons**: Interaction with peers, especially in male-dominated environments like locker rooms, can lead to comparisons that skew perceptions of size. Men often feel that they measure up unfavorably when comparing themselves to their peers, creating a cycle of self-doubt. Even if such comparisons are unfounded, the resulting perception can be impactful.\n\nIn summary, sociocultural influences, psychological factors, and peer comparisons are significant determinants of how men perceive their penis size beyond biological metrics like digit ratios.",
