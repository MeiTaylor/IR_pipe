These individuals worry that their penis is too small or that others will judge them for its size.\nSome doctors refer to small penis syndrome as penile dysmorphic disorder (PDD), but the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) does not list PDD as a separate disorder. Instead, it includes PDD as a variant of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD).\nPeople with small penis syndrome or PDD do not have an unusually small penis. Instead, they are severely anxious about their penis size.\nHaving a small penis is not a medical diagnosis. Very rarely, a person\u2019s penis is small enough to interfere with sexual functioning, and doctors will refer to it as a micropenis. People with a micropenis have a penis that is at least 2.5 standard deviations smaller than the average penis.\nPDD is a type of BDD, which is a disorder that distorts a person\u2019s perception of their body. BDD can trigger immense anxiety in a person about their appearance.\nPeople with PDD feel shame and anxiety about penis size. They may mistakenly believe that they have a micropenis, even when their penis size is normal.\nEstimates on average penis size vary. Many people believe that a typical penis is 6 inches (in) long, but this is false and misleading, potentially triggering anxiety in those who worry about having a small penis.\nA 2014 analysis of data from 15,521 men discovered the following about penis size:\nOther research has sought to quantify what counts as a micropenis. A 2014 study defined a micropenis as a penis that is less than 7 cm (about 2.75 in) in length when flaccid and stretched.\nFurthermore, research on more than 52,000 heterosexual men and woman found that 85 percent of women were satisfied with the size of their partner\u2019s penis. In comparison, only 55 percent of men were satisfied with their penis size.\nIt is common for people to occasionally worry that their penis might not be large enough, especially when they feel pressure from the media and from seeing larger male genitals in pornography.\nHowever, people with small penis syndrome obsessively worry about penis size.\nSome symptoms of small penis syndrome or PDD include:\nSome people with small penis syndrome have other symptoms...[Content truncated]",

The current study refined existing methods of evaluating women\u2019s body image in the context of sexuality by focusing upon two highly specified dimensions: satisfaction with the visual appearance of the genitalia and self-consciousness about the genitalia during a sexual encounter. Genital appearance dissatisfaction, genital image self-consciousness, and multiple facets of sexuality were examined with a sample of 217 undergraduate women using an online survey. Path analysis revealed that greater dissatisfaction with genital appearance was associated with higher genital image self-consciousness during physical intimacy, which, in turn, was associated with lower sexual esteem, sexual satisfaction, and motivation to avoid risky sexual behavior. These findings underscore the detrimental impact of negative genital perceptions on young women\u2019s sexual wellbeing, which is of particular concern given their vulnerability at this stage of sexual development as well as the high rates of sexually transmitted infections within this age group. Interventions that enhance satisfaction with the natural appearance of their genitalia could facilitate the development of a healthy sexual self-concept and provide long-term benefits in terms of sexual safety and satisfaction.\nWithin the United States, women are socialized to value physical appearance as an integral component of their sexuality as well as their more general self-concept. Beginning at an early age, women internalize social constructions of attractiveness and learn that increased proximity to these prescribed appearance ideals is often associated with greater desirability and opportunity across sexual, social, and occupational domains (e.g., Eagly, Ashmore, Makhijani, & Longo, 1991; Morrow, McElroy, Stamper, & Wilson, 1990; Singh & Young, 1995). Furthermore, exposure to the visual scrutiny of others continually reinforces the pressure that women experience to fit the physical prototype. According to Fredrickson and Roberts\u2019 (1997) objectification theory, such repeated subjection to physical inspection and evaluation causes women to adopt an observer\u2019s perspective on their bodies; women come to regard themselves as merely objects, or a collection...[Content truncated]",

Yet, there has been little research among men who have sex with men assessing the association between penis size and social-sexual health. Survey data from a diverse sample of 1,065 men who have sex with men were used to explore the association between perceived penis size and a variety of psychosocial outcomes. Seven percent of men felt their penis was \u201cbelow average,\u201d 53.9% \u201caverage,\u201d and 35.5% \u201cabove average.\u201d Penis size was positively related to satisfaction with size and inversely related to lying about penis size (all p < .01). Size was unrelated to condom use, frequency of sex partners, HIV status, or recent diagnoses of HBV, HCV, gonorrhea/Chlamydia/urinary tract infections, and syphilis. Men with above average penises were more likely to report HPV and HSV-2 (Fisher\u2019s exact p \u2264 .05). Men with below average penises were significantly more likely to identify as \u201cbottoms\u201d (anal receptive) and men with above average penises were significantly more likely to identify as tops (anal insertive). Finally, men with below average penises fared significantly worse than other men on three measures of psychosocial adjustment. Though most men felt their penis size was average, many fell outside this \u201cnorm.\u201d The disproportionate number of viral skin-to-skin STIs (HSV-2 and HPV) suggest size may play a role in condom slippage/breakage. Further, size played a significant role in sexual positioning and psychosocial adjustment. These data highlight the need to better understand the real individual-level consequences of living in a penis-centered society.\nThough it is well known that men\u2019s penises come in many shapes and sizes, larger penis size has been equated with a symbol of power, fertility, stamina, masculinity, and social status (Bogaert & Hershberger, 1999; Bordo, 1999; Connell, 1987, 1995; Drummond & Filiault, 2007; Lehman, 1998; Paley, 2000; Pope, Phillips, & Olivardia, 2000; Stulhofer...[Content truncated]",

A large majority, 45 of 50, reported width was more important (p < .001).\nImplications are discussed, including the fact that the data seem to contradict Masters and Johnson about penis size having no physiological effect on female sexual satisfaction.\nWhen people speak of penis size, they typically refer to length. Thus, a man with a short but wide penis would probably think of himself as having a small penis, and would be so thought of by others, too. However, width is part of size, although usually not acknowledged. Does width contribute to female sexual satisfaction? Is length more important? Or, perhaps size is unrelated to female sexual enjoyment.\nThe famous sex researchers Masters and Johnson [1,2] have concluded that size of the male penis can have no true physiological effect on female sexual satisfaction. They base this conclusion on their physiological studies that show that the vagina adapts to fit the size of the penis. Because of this vaginal adaptation, they refer to the vagina as a potential space rather than an actual space. Thus, despite the worries of many males about the size of their penis, Masters and Johnson concluded that any size penis will fit and provide adequate sexual stimulation to the female. The present study was conducted to see if female college students would report their sexual satisfaction related to penis length, width, or neither.\nTo test the notion of the possible importance of length vs. width and female sexual satisfaction, two male undergraduate college students - both popular athletes on campus - surveyed 50 female undergraduate college students, considered by the two males to be sexually active, based on the males' prior social experience and knowledge of the females.\nThe female students ranged in age from 18 to 25 years old. In person or via telephone, the females were asked \"In having sex, which feels better, length of penis or width of penis?\" In half the cases, the word \"width\" was used before the word \"length,\"...[Content truncated]",

We analyzed event-related potentials (ERPs) and behavioral responses of N\u2009=\u200940 participants who performed a naturalness classification task on real and artificially created facial expressions. While the emotion-related effects on accuracy for recognizing authentic expressions were modulated by stimulus size, ERPs showed only additive effects of stimulus size and emotional expression, with no significant interaction with size. This contrasts with previous research on emotional scenes and words. Effects of size were present in all included ERPs, whereas emotional expressions affected the N170, EPN, and LPC, irrespective of size. These results imply that the decoding of emotional valence in faces can occur even for small stimuli. Supra-additive effects in faces may necessitate larger size ranges or dynamic stimuli that increase arousal.\nEncountering an individual staring at you with anger requires rapid recognition, appraisal, and response\u2014particularly if the person is in close proximity. Over decades, research has accumulated evidence supporting preferential processing of emotional facial expressions compared to neutral expressions1,2,3,4, likely attributable to their biological relevance5. However, several boundary conditions have been identified to moderate emotion effects, such as task demands4,6,7 or reappraisal8,9. As face perception is strongly context-dependent10, (perceived) physical distance and an accurate representation of emotional cues modulates the processing of faces and their relevance. Thus, the main goal of the present study was to systematically investigate how the perception of emotional facial expressions is influenced by stimulus size. We presented faces showing real or manipulated happy, angry, or neutral expressions of different sizes and implemented a go/no-go task, in which participants judged the naturalness of the expression. Additionally, we incorporated scrambled faces in different sizes as emotionally meaningless control stimuli (no-go condition).\nThere are at least two different ways stimulus size may affect the neurophysiological processing of faces: First, especially early visual processing is influenced by several stimulus features like luminance11, contrast12, and spatial frequencies13, which can also be indirectly influenced by the retinal size of a stimulus14. Hence, the visual processing of the same arbitrary object varies when presented at different distances, attributed to changes in its retinal size. Second, stimulus size correlates with perceived physical proximity and distance, at least for stimuli like faces whose real size is known15. Previous research suggests that the perception of biologically relevant stimuli, such as faces, is enhanced as stimulus size increases. For example, pictures of emotional and neutral scenes produced differences in autonomic responses depending on the size they were...[Content truncated]",
