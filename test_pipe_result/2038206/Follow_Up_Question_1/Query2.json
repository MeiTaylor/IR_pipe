The age at which the circumcision had been done was assessed. The patients’ height and weight were measured. Second to fourth digit ratio was calculated by measuring the second and fourth digit lengths. The flaccid and erectile penile lengths were measured from the base of the penis to the tip of the glans in standing position.\nA total of 248 patients were included in our study. In univariate analysis, height, second to fourth digit ratio, flaccid penile length, and age of circumcision were associated with erectile penile length. Among these variables, second to fourth digit ratio, flaccid penile length, and age of circumcision were significant predictive factors for erectile penile length in multivariate analysis. The subjects were divided into two groups, including 72 patients in the NMC group and 176 patients in the non-NMC group. No significant difference was found in height, weight, and second to fourth digit ratio between both groups. However, fl...[Content truncated]",

Asian J Androl. 2011 Sep.\nAbstract\n--------\nThe second to fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) has been proposed as a putative biomarker for prenatal testosterone and covaries with the sensitivity of the androgen receptor (AR). Both prenatal testosterone and the AR play a central role in penile growth. In this study, we investigated the relationship between digit ratio and penile length. Korean men who were hospitalized for urological surgery at a single tertiary academic centre were examined in this study, and 144 men aged 20 years or older who gave informed consent were prospectively enrolled. Right-hand second- and fourth-digit lengths were measured by a single investigator prior to measurement of penile length. Under anaesthesia, flaccid and stretched penile lengths were measured by another investigator who did not measure nor have any the information regarding the digit lengths. Univariate and multivariate analysis using linear regression models showed that only height was a significant predictive factor for flaccid penile length (univariate analysis: r=0.185, P=0.026; multivariate analysis: r=0.172, P=0.038) and that only digit ratio was a significant predictive factor for stretched penile length (univariate analysis:r=-0.216, P=0.009; multivariate analysis: r=-0.201, P=0.024; stretched penile length=-9.201×digit ratio + 20.577).

It is proposed that the 2D:4D ratio indicates the degree to which an individual has been exposed to androgens during key stages of fetal development. A lower ratio has been associated with higher androgen exposure, which would be the physiological norm for males but may also occur in some exceptional circumstances in females. The latter include developmental disorders such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia. \n\nThe 2D:4D ratio has been postulated to correlate with a range of physical and cognitive traits in childhood and adulthood, including personality traits, such as assertiveness in women, aggressiveness in men and cognitive abilities such as numerical skills.[1] It has also been shown to vary considerably between racial groups[2] with males having, on average, lower 2D:4D ratio than females.[3]\n\nStudies in this field have drawn criticism over questionable statistical significance and difficulties in reproducing their findings[4][5][6] as well as lack of high quality research protocols.[7]\n\nThe 2D:4D ratio is calculated by dividing the length of the index finger by the length of the ring finger of the same hand. Other digit ratios are also calculated similarly in the same hand.\n\nThe digit length is typically measured on the palmar (ventral, \"palm-side\") hand, from the midpoint of the bottom crease to the tip of the finger.[8] Measurement of the digits on the dorsal (\"back-side\") hand, from the tip of the finger to the proximal phalange-bone protrusion (which occurs when digits are bent at 90 degrees to the palm) has also recently gained acceptance.[9][10] A study has shown that, compared to the palmar digit ratio, the dorsal digit ratio is a better indicator of bone digit ratio.[10] Furthermore, the palmar digit ratio is affected by the differential positioning of flexion creases.[11]\n\nIt has been alleged that, because academics have accepted a variety of techniques and equipment (such as calipers, radiography and photocopy), researchers record multiple measurements and report only those which have significant findings,[7] a form...[Content truncated]",

                    "content": "Does size matter? A new finding shows evidence of a link between the relative length of a man’s index and ring fingers and a way to predict the length of his penis. Asian scientists have found that the ratio between the second and fourth digits on a man’s right hand seemed to correlate to the length of his flaccid and stretched penis, with a lower index to ring finger length ratio indicating a longer penis. \n Over the past decade, the correlation of digit ratio with sexual behavior and other aspects of reproductive biology have been well documented and there is a growing list of traits with links to digit ratio, although the associations are less well established. \n The key to this relationship may lie in the womb. In Ho Choi of Gacheon University Gil Hospital in Incheon explains: \n “During the fetal period, high concentrations of testosterone lead to high testicular activity, resulting in a lower digit ratio. In the present study, patients with a lower digit ratio tended to have a longer stretched penile length.”\n Choi and colleagues compared the digit ratios of 144 Korean men aged 20 and older who were being treated for urological surgery. Researchers measured the index and ring fingers of each man’s right hand and compared the ratio to the length of each man’s fully stretched, flaccid penis (the latter data obtained under anesthesia). \n In a journal commentary, Denise Brooks McQuade of Skidmore College, Saratoga Springs, N.Y., said the study results “provide convincing support for a relationship between digit ratio and penile length.” She added that the findings might have real value for research into clinical conditions linked to developmental issues in men. \n A non-erect penis usually measures between 8.5cm and 10.5cm (3-4 inches) from tip to base. The average size is about 9.5cm (3.75 inches). Many factors can cause a temporary shrinkage of two inches or more, for instance cold weather or going swimming can effect an accurate measurement. \n It is a fact though that some men have big penises and some have smaller ones, just as some men have small feet and some have big feet, but the measurement is not an index...[Content truncated]",

But Kim and colleagues linked a larger gap in finger length -- a lower 2D:4D ratio -- to a longer stretched-out penis.\n\"Based on this evidence, we suggest that digit ratio can predict adult penile size, and that the effects of prenatal testosterone may in part explain the differences in adult penile length,\" the researchers reported Monday in the Asian Journal of Andrology.\nThe length of the penis when stretched is believed to correlate to its erect length, the team reported.\nEarlier studies suggest the 2D:4D ratio is governed by prenatal exposure to the male and female sex hormones, testosterone and estrogen. Women tend to have ring and index fingers of roughly equal length -- a result of less testosterone exposure in the womb, report the Korean researchers.\nBut men who have relatively long ring fingers are thought to have been exposed to high levels of testosterone in utero, and this has been linked to aggression, athleticism, sexuality, intelligence, and even the ability to trade high-stakes stocks. It has also been linked to a higher risk for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,...[Content truncated]",
