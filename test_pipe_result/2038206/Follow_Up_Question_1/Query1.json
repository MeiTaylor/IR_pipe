But Kim and colleagues linked a larger gap in finger length -- a lower 2D:4D ratio -- to a longer stretched-out penis.\n\"Based on this evidence, we suggest that digit ratio can predict adult penile size, and that the effects of prenatal testosterone may in part explain the differences in adult penile length,\" the researchers reported Monday in the Asian Journal of Andrology.\nThe length of the penis when stretched is believed to correlate to its erect length, the team reported.\nEarlier studies suggest the 2D:4D ratio is governed by . Women tend to have ring and index fingers of roughly equal length -- a result of less testosterone exposure in the womb, report the Korean researchers.\nBut men who have relatively long ring fingers are thought to have been exposed to high levels of testosterone in utero, and this has been linked to aggression, athleticism, sexuality, intelligence, and even the ability to trade high-stakes stocks. It has also been linked to a higher risk for , prostate cancer and arthritis.\nIn 2000, a controversial study suggested women who had a 2D:4D ratio more typical of a man's were more likely to be lesbians. The \"gay\" link did not hold true for men, however.\nLargely dismissed old wives' tales have long held that a man's hands and feet hold clues about his genitalia and their various metrics. In an episode of \"Friends,\" Ross, Chandler and Joey show off their hands after hearing that penis length is the same as the distance between the index finger and the thumb. A man's small shoe size has also been taken to reflect certain penile shortcomings.\nMaybe they're not such tall tales after all.\n* * *\n...[Content truncated]",

Are your index and ring fingers mismatched? Congratulations, you're more likely than men with matching digits to have a long penis.\nA smaller ratio between the second and fourth fingers is linked to a longer stretched penis size, researchers report today (July 4) in the Asian Journal of Andrology. The findings go beyond providing a new  for men in bars, however; researchers say that a quick look at a man's fingers could reveal his exposure to male hormones in the womb, providing a hint about his risk for hormone-driven diseases like prostate cancer.\nThe idea that men's finger ratio and hormone exposure are linked is not a new one. Studies have found that the ratio between the second and fourth finger is related to sperm count, likelihood of heart attack, hand preference,  and more. One small 2002 study published in the journal Urology found a correlation between the length of the index finger and genital size in healthy men under 40, suggesting that testosterone exposure in the womb affects the growth of both.\n**Stretched penis length**\nIn the new study, researchers at Gachon University Gil Hospital in South Korea recruited 144 volunteers 20 years of age and older who were going to undergo urological surgery. While the men were under anesthesia, the researchers measured their finger lengths and both their flaccid and stretched penis lengths. Stretched penis length is statistically correlated to the size of the penis when fully erect. \\\\]\nThe average flaccid penis length, the researchers found, was 3.0 inches (7.7 centimeters), with a...[Content truncated]",

It is proposed that the 2D:4D ratio indicates the degree to which an individual has been exposed to androgens during key stages of fetal development. A lower ratio has been associated with higher androgen exposure, which would be the physiological norm for males but may also occur in some exceptional circumstances in females. The latter include developmental disorders such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia. \n\nThe 2D:4D ratio has been postulated to correlate with a range of physical and cognitive traits in childhood and adulthood, including personality traits, such as assertiveness in women, aggressiveness in men and cognitive abilities such as numerical skills.[1] It has also been shown to vary considerably between racial groups[2] with males having, on average, lower 2D:4D ratio than females.[3]\n\nStudies in this field have drawn criticism over questionable statistical significance and difficulties in reproducing their findings[4][5][6] as well as lack of high quality research protocols.[7]\n\nThe 2D:4D ratio is calculated by dividing the length of the index finger by the length of the ring finger of the same hand. Other digit ratios are also calculated similarly in the same hand.\n\nThe digit length is typically measured on the palmar (ventral, \"palm-side\") hand, from the midpoint of the bottom crease to the tip of the finger.[8] Measurement of the digits on the dorsal (\"back-side\") hand, from the tip of the finger to the proximal phalange-bone protrusion (which occurs when digits are bent at 90Â degrees to the palm) has also recently gained acceptance.[9][10] A study has shown that, compared to the palmar digit ratio, the dorsal digit ratio is a better indicator of bone digit ratio.[10] Furthermore, the palmar digit ratio is affected by the differential positioning of flexion creases.[11]\n\nIt has been alleged that, because academics have accepted a variety of techniques and equipment (such as calipers, radiography and photocopy), researchers record multiple measurements and report only those which have significant findings,[7] a form...[Content truncated]",

Patients aged <20 years and those who underwent surgery for the nose and penis were excluded. Nose size was determined by measuring the length, width, and height of the nose, which were used to calculate the volume of the triangular pyramid. Stretched penile length (SPL) and penile circumference before erection were measured. The participantsâ height, weight, foot size, and serum testosterone levels were measured. Testicular size was measured using ultrasonography. Predictors of penile length and circumference were assessed using linear regression analysis.\nThe participantsâ average age was 35.5 years, mean SPL was 11.2 cm, and mean penile circumference was 6.8 cm.

The age at which the circumcision had been done was assessed. The patientsâ height and weight were measured. Second to fourth digit ratio was calculated by measuring the second and fourth digit lengths. The flaccid and erectile penile lengths were measured from the base of the penis to the tip of the glans in standing position.\nA total of 248 patients were included in our study. In univariate analysis, height, second to fourth digit ratio, flaccid penile length, and age of circumcision were associated with erectile penile length. Among these variables, second to fourth digit ratio, flaccid penile length, and age of circumcision were significant predictive factors for erectile penile length in multivariate analysis. The subjects were divided into two groups, including 72 patients in the NMC group and 176 patients in the non-NMC group. No significant difference was found in height, weight, and second to fourth digit ratio between both groups. However, fl...[Content truncated]",

The Republican front runner, now famously, struck back in the debate reassuring voters that there was âno problemâ with the size of his hands, or anything else for that matter. \n    \n\n            The candidates were playing off an age-old assumption that if a manâs hands were small so must be the size of his penis. The source of Rubioâs comment refers back to a 1988 Spy magazine article that called Trump a âshort-fingered vulgarian,â perhaps insulting both his tongue and his manhood. \n    \n\n            As a medical story, this is low-hanging fruit, so to speak, but given the pervasiveness of the myth (or reality), we decided to investigate what the science says on the matter. If this were a political reality check story our meter would be stuck on âhalf true.â\n    \n\n            Sifting through a handful of studies we can conclude that while you wonât see the size of a manâs hands listed on a Tinder profile any time soon, a description of a manâs fingers may actually give you a tiny, and we mean tiny, bit of insight. \n    \n\n            One finger, and no, not the middle one, holds the key.

In an exploratory analysis of this phenomenon, respondents provided self-reports of various behaviors and traits previously shown to be related to testosterone and finger-length ratios and also indicated whether or not their second toe was the longest of their toes (i.e., extended beyond their other toes). Results yielded a significant association between longer second-toe length and left-handedness for both men and women. For women only, relationships between a longer second toe and a competitiveness orientation, a winning orientation, and physical aggression were found. For men only, a relationship between a longer second toe and exercise frequency was found.

Johnson, 1979, p. 120\nMen were asked: \"How long is your penis, measuring on the top side from your belly out to the tip?\" They were each given a pre-stamped card to take home, and instructed to mark the length on the card when flaccid and when erect. Approximately 2,500 men participated.\n\n During interviews with over 4,000 men, the interviewer asked each subject to estimate his penis size. The interviewer would hold out a ruler (the numerals were not visible to the subject) and move his finger along it.\n\n There was a slight underestimation of penis size compared with actual measurements.\n (Gebhard & Johnson 1979, p. 116.)\nThere is a much wider range of size in men's penises when flaccid, with the average ranging from 1 to 4 inches. In general, smaller, flaccid penises lengthen at erection by a greater percentage than larger, flaccid penises, with most men reaching an average size of 5 to 7 inches. This means the flaccid size of a penis is not a good predictor of erect size. The vast majority of men measure within the average genital size range and have a penis size that is more than adequate for sexual functioning.\nThis term is used by researchers to refer to penises less than 2.8 inches (7 centimeters) in length when stretched. This condition is thought to affect only 0.6% of men (or six in 1,000 men) and caused by inadequate testosterone at a late stage of fetal development.\nThere is no non-surgical technique to make the penis bigger. Penis pumps may help create a stronger erection, but they will not create a larger penis.Â  Because the penis is composed largely of spongy erectile tissue and not of muscle, it cannot be strengthened or \"built up.\" Surgery may cause scar tissue to grow that can cause a painful or even a shortened erection.\nBelow is a selected bibliography of research resources related to penis size compiled in response to frequent questions received by the Institute.\nFor a review of penis size studies, see Wylie, K.and Eardley, I.
