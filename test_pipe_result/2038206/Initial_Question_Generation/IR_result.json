But there are concrete skills you can use to hone your assertiveness and advocate for yourself.\n      \n Verified by Psychology Today\n\n                                    Posted March 6, 2016\n\n|\n\n\nReviewed by Jessica Schrader\n\n\n\nIt has been reported that the length of a man’s index finger is a fairly accurate indicator of his organ size.\nThis relationship has been confirmed in several studies, but one of the more notable and recent of these was performed at Gachon University Gil Hospital in South Korea: a 2011 study published in the Asian Journal of Andrology suggested that men with shorter index fingers in relation to their ring fingers were more likely to have a larger penis. Researchers measured the index fingers and penises of 144 volunteers and found that the link was significantly consistent: The bigger the difference between a man’s index and ring finger, the bigger his penis was likely to be. This may have something to do with prenatal hormone exposure. \nPrevious research has found that this 2D:4D ratio—the ratio of the ­length of the second digit (the index finger) to that of the fourth digit (the ring finger)—reveals the amount of male hormones, mainly testosterone, a person is exposed to in the womb. The more testosterone exposure, the longer the ring finger grows—and the greater the man's fertility, sexuality, promiscuity, and attractiveness.\nAgain, in 2011, this time in a study published in the journal, Proceedings of the Royal Society, researchers concluded that the testosterone to which the fetus is exposed can affect how the individual’s face develops and how attractive that face is.\nInterestingly, men with short index fingers and long ring fingers tend to be nicer toward women, according to a study published in the March 2015 issue of the journal Personality and Individual Differences.

Both prenatal testosterone and the AR play a central role in penile growth. In this study, we investigated the relationship between digit ratio and penile length. Korean men who were hospitalized for urological surgery at a single tertiary academic centre were examined in this study, and 144 men aged 20 years or older who gave informed consent were prospectively enrolled. Right-hand second- and fourth-digit lengths were measured by a single investigator prior to measurement of penile length. Under anaesthesia, flaccid and stretched penile lengths were measured by another investigator who did not measure nor have any the information regarding the digit lengths. Univariate and multivariate analysis using linear regression models showed that only height was a significant predictive factor for flaccid penile length (univariate analysis: r=0.185, P=0.026; multivariate analysis: r=0.172, P=0.038) and that only digit ratio was a significant predictive factor for stretched penile length (univariate analysis:r=−0.216...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "Does the video provide credible evidence linking a man's hand size to penis size?",
        "Answer": "The video does not provide credible evidence linking a man's hand size to penis size. Instead, credible research from various studies indicates a potential relationship between digit ratios (specifically, the ratio of the second to fourth fingers) and penile size.\n\n1. **Scientific Studies**: Research conducted by Korean scientists has found that men with a larger difference in length between their ring and index fingers (as indicated by a lower 2D:4D ratio) tend to have a longer stretched penis size. This suggests that finger length can be a predictor of adult penile size due to the influence of prenatal testosterone on both digit growth and genitalia development [Query2_evidence1] [Query2_evidence2].\n\n2. **Experimental Evidence**: In one study, 144 men undergoing urological surgery had their finger lengths and penis sizes measured while under anesthesia. This study reported that a smaller ratio between the second and fourth fingers was statistically correlated with longer penis lengths [Query2_evidence3]. \n\n3. **Hormonal Influence**: The underlying theory connects the exposure to male hormones in the womb to both digit ratio and penile growth, suggesting that a quick observation of finger lengths may offer insight into a man's penile size as shaped by hormonal influences during prenatal development [Query2_evidence2].\n\nGiven this analysis, while the video makes a claim about penis size being related to hand size, it does not provide direct evidence or support for this assertion. The credible evidence actually comes from scientific studies that examine finger ratios rather than hand size in general.",
