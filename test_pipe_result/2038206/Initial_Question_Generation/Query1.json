But Kim and colleagues linked a larger gap in finger length -- a lower 2D:4D ratio -- to a longer stretched-out penis.\n\"Based on this evidence, we suggest that digit ratio can predict adult penile size, and that the effects of prenatal testosterone may in part explain the differences in adult penile length,\" the researchers reported Monday in the Asian Journal of Andrology.\nThe length of the penis when stretched is believed to correlate to its erect length, the team reported.\nEarlier studies suggest the 2D:4D ratio is governed by prenatal exposure to the male and female sex hormones, testosterone and estrogen. Women tend to have ring and index fingers of roughly equal length -- a result of less testosterone exposure in the womb, report the Korean researchers.\nBut men who have relatively long ring fingers are thought to have been exposed to high levels of testosterone in utero, and this has been linked to aggression, athleticism, sexuality, intelligence, and even the ability to trade high-stakes stocks. It has also been linked to a higher risk for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, prostate cancer and arthritis.\n...[Content truncated]",

Congratulations, you're more likely than men with matching digits to have a long penis.\nA smaller ratio between the second and fourth fingers is linked to a longer stretched penis size, researchers report today (July 4) in the Asian Journal of Andrology. The findings go beyond providing a new  for men in bars, however; researchers say that a quick look at a man's fingers could reveal his exposure to male hormones in the womb, providing a hint about his risk for hormone-driven diseases like prostate cancer.\nThe idea that men's finger ratio and hormone exposure are linked is not a new one. Studies have found that the ratio between the second and fourth finger is related to sperm count, likelihood of heart attack, hand preference,  and more. One small 2002 study published in the journal Urology found a correlation between the length of the index finger and genital size in healthy men under 40, suggesting that testosterone exposure in the womb affects the growth of both.\n**Stretched penis length**\nIn the new study, researchers at Gachon University Gil Hospital in South Korea recruited 144 volunteers 20 years of age and older who were going to undergo u...[Content truncated]",

These participants were selected from a subset of 1,531 patients who visited the Dr. JOMULJU Urology Clinic between March and October 2022. Patients aged <20 years and those who underwent surgery for the nose and penis were excluded. Nose size was determined by measuring the length, width, and height of the nose, which were used to calculate the volume of the triangular pyramid. Stretched penile length (SPL) and penile circumference before erection were measured. The participants’ height, weight, foot size, and serum testosterone levels were measured. Testicular size was measured using ultrasonography. Predictors of penile length and circumference were assessed using linear regression analysis.\nThe participants’ average age was 35.5 years, mean SPL was 11.2 cm, and mean penile circumference was 6.8 cm. Univariate analysis revealed that body weight, body mass index (BMI), the serum testosterone level, and nose size were associated with SPL. Multivariable analysis revealed that BMI (P=0.001) and nose size (P=0.023) were significant predictors of SPL. Univariate analysis revealed that penile circumference was related to an individual’s height, weight,...[Content truncated]",

Researchers measured the index fingers and penises of 144 volunteers and found that the link was significantly consistent: The bigger the difference between a man’s index and ring finger, the bigger his penis was likely to be. This may have something to do with prenatal hormone exposure. \nPrevious research has found that this 2D:4D ratio—the ratio of the ­length of the second digit (the index finger) to that of the fourth digit (the ring finger)—reveals the amount of male hormones, mainly testosterone, a person is exposed to in the womb. The more testosterone exposure, the longer the ring finger grows—and the greater the man's fertility, sexuality, promiscuity, and attractiveness.\nAgain, in 2011, this time in a study published in the journal, Proceedings of the Royal Society, researchers concluded that the testosterone to which the fetus is exposed can affect how the individual’s face develops and how attractive that face is.\nInterestingly, men with short index fingers and long ring fingers tend to be nicer toward women, according to a study published in the March 2015 issue of the journal Personality and Individual Differences.

Erect length increased significantly over time in several regions of the world and across all age groups, while no trends were identified in other penile size measurements. After adjusting for geographic region, subject age, and subject population; erect penile length increased 24% over the past 29 years.\"[4] Belladelli (2023) also indicated that \"importantly, when the current analyses were adjusted for the technique to achieve erection, the point estimates remained similar.\"[4]\n\nLimited to no statistically significant correlation between penis size and the size of other body parts has been found in research. Some environmental factors in addition to genetics, such as the presence of endocrine disruptors, can affect penis growth.\n\nWhile results vary slightly across reputable studies, the consensus is that the mean human penis, when erect, is in the range 12.9–15 cm (5.1–5.9 in) in length.[3][5][6]\n\nA 2015 systematic review published by Veale et al. of medical research on the topic over the previous 30 years published in BJU International showed similar results, giving mean flaccid, stretched non-erect, and erect lengths of 9.16 cm, 13.24 cm, and 13.12 cm respectively, and mean flaccid and erect circumferences of 9.31 cm and 11.66 cm respectively. Erect lengths in the included studies were measured by pushing the pre-pubic fat pad to the bone, and flaccid or erect girth (circumference) was measured at the base or mid-shaft of the penis.[2]\n\nThe meta-analysis and systematic review by Belladelli et al. (2023) of 55,761 men from 75 studies, done between 1942 and 2021, and based on estimations of pooled mean length, indicated that the average erect penis length was 13.93 centimetres (5.48 in), average stretched penis length was 12.93 centimetres (5.09 in), and average flaccid penis length was 8.70 centimetres (3.43 in).[4] Belladelli (2023) indicated that \"all measurements showed variation by geographic region.
