But Kim and colleagues linked a larger gap in finger length -- a lower 2D:4D ratio -- to a longer stretched-out penis.\n\"Based on this evidence, we suggest that digit ratio can predict adult penile size, and that the effects of prenatal testosterone may in part explain the differences in adult penile length,\" the researchers reported Monday in the Asian Journal of Andrology.\nThe length of the penis when stretched is believed to correlate to its erect length, the team reported.\nEarlier studies suggest the 2D:4D ratio is governed by prenatal exposure to the male and female sex hormones, testosterone and estrogen. Women tend to have ring and index fingers of roughly equal length -- a result of less testosterone exposure in the womb, report the Korean researchers.\nBut men who have relatively long ring fingers are thought to have been exposed to high levels of testosterone in utero, and this has been linked to aggression, athleticism, sexuality, intelligence, and even the ability to trade high-stakes stocks. It has also been linked to a higher risk for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, prostate cancer and arthritis.\nIn 2000, a controversial study suggested women who had a 2D:4D ratio more typical of a man's were more likely to be lesbians. The \"gay\" link did not hold true for men, however.\nLargely dismissed old wives' tales have long held that a man's hands and feet hold clues about his genitalia and their various...[Content truncated]",

Congratulations, you're more likely than men with matching digits to have a long penis.\nA smaller ratio between the second and fourth fingers is linked to a longer stretched penis size, researchers report today (July 4) in the Asian Journal of Andrology. The findings go beyond providing a new  for men in bars, however; researchers say that a quick look at a man's fingers could reveal his exposure to male hormones in the womb, providing a hint about his risk for hormone-driven diseases like prostate cancer.\nThe idea that men's finger ratio and hormone exposure are linked is not a new one. Studies have found that the ratio between the second and fourth finger is related to sperm count, likelihood of heart attack, hand preference,  and more. One small 2002 study published in the journal Urology found a correlation between the length of the index finger and genital size in healthy men under 40, suggesting that testosterone exposure in the womb affects the growth of both.\n**Stretched penis length**\nIn the new study, researchers at Gachon University Gil Hospital in South Korea recruited 144 volunteers 20 years of age and older who were going to undergo urological surgery. While the men were under anesthesia, the researchers measured their finger lengths and both their flaccid and stretched penis lengths. Stretched penis length is statistically correlated to the size of the penis when fully erect. \\ \\]\nThe average flaccid penis length, the researchers found, was 3.0 inches (7.7 centimeters), with a range of 1.6 to 4.7 in. (4 to 12 cm). Stretched lengths ranged from nearly 3.0 to 6.7 in. (7.5 to 17 cm), with an average of 4.6 in. (11.7 cm).\nThe average...[Content truncated]",

                    "content": "\n\nHuman penises vary in size on a number of measures, including  length and circumference when flaccid and erect. Besides the natural variability of human penises in general, there are factors that lead to minor variations in a particular male, such as the level of arousal, time of day, ambient temperature, anxiety level, physical activity, and frequency of sexual activity. Compared to other primates, including large examples such as the gorilla, the human penis is thickest, both in absolute terms and relative to the rest of the body. Most human penis growth occurs in two stages: the first between infancy and the age of five; and then between about one year after the onset of puberty and, at the latest, approximately 17 years of age.[1]\n\nMeasurements vary, with studies that rely on self-measurement reporting a significantly higher average than those with a health professional measuring. As of 2015[update], a systematic review of 15,521 men, who were measured by health professionals rather than themselves, concluded that the average length of an erect human penis is 13.12\u00a0cm (5.17 inches) long, while the average circumference of an erect human penis is 11.66\u00a0cm (4.59 inches).[2] A 1996 study of flaccid length found a mean of 8.8\u00a0cm (3.5\u00a0in) when measured by staff.[3] Flaccid penis length can sometimes be a poor predictor of erect length. An adult penis that is abnormally small but otherwise normally formed is referred to in medicine as a micropenis, with the cutoff usually being defined as around 3 inches (7.6 cm).\n\nMore recently, the meta-analysis and systematic review by Belladelli et al. (2023) of 55,761 men from 75 studies, done between 1942 and 2021, and based on estimations of pooled mean length, indicated that the average erect penis length was 13.93 centimetres (5.48\u00a0in), average stretched penis length was 12.93 centimetres (5.09\u00a0in), and average flaccid penis length was 8.70 centimetres (3.43\u00a0in).[4] Belladelli (2023) indicated that \"all measurements showed variation by geographic region. Erect length increased significantly over time in several regions of the world and across all age groups, while no trends were identified in other penile size measurements.

Both prenatal testosterone and the AR play a central role in penile growth. In this study, we investigated the relationship between digit ratio and penile length. Korean men who were hospitalized for urological surgery at a single tertiary academic centre were examined in this study, and 144 men aged 20 years or older who gave informed consent were prospectively enrolled. Right-hand second- and fourth-digit lengths were measured by a single investigator prior to measurement of penile length. Under anaesthesia, flaccid and stretched penile lengths were measured by another investigator who did not measure nor have any the information regarding the digit lengths. Univariate and multivariate analysis using linear regression models showed that only height was a significant predictive factor for flaccid penile length (univariate analysis: r=0.185, P=0.026; multivariate analysis: r=0.172, P=0.038) and that only digit ratio was a significant predictive factor for stretched penile length (univariate analysis:r=\u22120.216...[Content truncated]",

But there are concrete skills you can use to hone your assertiveness and advocate for yourself.\n      \n Verified by Psychology Today\n\n                                    Posted March 6, 2016\n\n|\n\n\nReviewed by Jessica Schrader\n\n\n\nIt has been reported that the length of a man\u2019s index finger is a fairly accurate indicator of his organ size.\nThis relationship has been confirmed in several studies, but one of the more notable and recent of these was performed at Gachon University Gil Hospital in South Korea: a 2011 study published in the Asian Journal of Andrology suggested that men with shorter index fingers in relation to their ring fingers were more likely to have a larger penis. Researchers measured the index fingers and penises of 144 volunteers and found that the link was significantly consistent: The bigger the difference between a man\u2019s index and ring finger, the bigger his penis was likely to be. This may have something to do with prenatal hormone exposure. \nPrevious research has found that this 2D:4D ratio\u2014the ratio of the \u00adlength of the second digit (the index finger) to that of the fourth digit (the ring finger)\u2014reveals the amount of male hormones, mainly testosterone, a person is exposed to in the womb. The more testosterone exposure, the longer the ring finger grows\u2014and the greater the man's fertility, sexuality, promiscuity, and attractiveness.\nAgain, in 2011, this time in a study published in the journal, Proceedings of the Royal Society, researchers concluded that the testosterone to which the fetus is exposed can affect how the individual\u2019s face develops and how attractive that face is.\nInterestingly, men with short index fingers and long ring fingers tend to be nicer toward women, according to a study published in the March 2015 issue of the journal Personality and Individual Differences. Again, this is thought to be as a result of sex hormone exposure in the womb.\nIn this study from last year, men and women completed questionnaires in which they documented each social interaction with a member of the opposite sex lasting five minutes or longer in a three-week period, interpreting so-called agreeable and disagreeable behaviors. Men with shorter index fingers relative to ring fingers engaged in roughly a third more agreeable behaviors toward women, and a third fewer quarrelsome ones, than men with the opposite ratios.\nWhat woman doesn\u2019t want the strong,...[Content truncated]",

Male adult film stars tend to have large penises, which doesn\u2019t reflect the actual average size, so it's important not to compare yourself based on these standards. One study found that those who watch porn tend to be more unhappy with their penis size than those who don\u2019t. Penises come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and one kind isn\u2019t necessarily better than another.\nSex organs like penises grow during puberty, which usually starts between the ages of 9 and 14 and continues for another 5 years. This means your penis would have grown to its maximum size by the time you\u2019ve reached your\u00a0early\u00a020s.\u00a0\nIf you are wondering what the average penis size is at this age, the answer may surprise you. Most men believe that an average penis measures 15.24\u2009centimeters (6.0 inches) or more when erect. This belief is partly spread by popular studies relying on self-reported measurements. Since people often judge their sexual attractiveness based on their penis size,\u00a0some might give answers they think will be viewed more favorably. This results in incorrect data.\nHowever, a few studies have been carried out in the past decade in which penis size measurements were taken by health experts using standard procedures. According to one of those studies, these are the average sizes of penises in their different states:\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the size of a flaccid penis isn\u2019t a good indicator of how big it will be when it\u2019s erect. Smaller flaccid penises do tend to lengthen more when they become hard compared to larger ones, but there\u2019s still a lot of variation.\nMen with male sexual partners may not find these numbers surprising. Studies show that they have more accurate ideas of average penis sizes since they are exposed to greater numbers of penises.\nWhat is a micropenis?\u00a0\nA micropenis works just like any other penis, but it\u2019s smaller in size, measuring less than 3.67 inches when gently stretched. It\u2019s estimated that only 0.6 percent of people in the world have a micropenis. Hormones or genetics can prevent the penis from growing to a larger size. Most commonly, it happens during pregnancy if the fetus doesn\u2019t get enough testosterone.\u00a0\nIs penis size genetic?\u00a0\nPenis size, like eye and skin color, is mostly determined by genetics.\u00a0Studies have found another factor to be a strong indicator of flaccid penis size: height. Not surprisingly, your height is also influenced by your genetics.\nBesides macro factors, these micro factors could influence your penis size:\u00a0\nHormones. Hormonal issues during pregnancy can affect...[Content truncated]",

These participants were selected from a subset of 1,531 patients who visited the Dr. JOMULJU Urology Clinic between March and October 2022. Patients aged <20 years and those who underwent surgery for the nose and penis were excluded. Nose size was determined by measuring the length, width, and height of the nose, which were used to calculate the volume of the triangular pyramid. Stretched penile length (SPL) and penile circumference before erection were measured. The participants\u2019 height, weight, foot size, and serum testosterone levels were measured. Testicular size was measured using ultrasonography. Predictors of penile length and circumference were assessed using linear regression analysis.\nThe participants\u2019 average age was 35.5 years, mean SPL was 11.2 cm, and mean penile circumference was 6.8 cm. Univariate analysis revealed that body weight, body mass index (BMI), the serum testosterone level, and nose size were associated with SPL. Multivariable analysis revealed that BMI (P=0.001) and nose size (P=0.023) were significant predictors of SPL. Univariate analysis revealed that penile circumference was related to an individual\u2019s height, weight, BMI, nose size, and foot size. Multivariable analysis revealed that body weight (P=0.008) and testicular size (P=0.002) were significant predictors of penile circumference.\nNose size was a significant predictor of penile size. The sizes of the penis and nose increased with a decrease in BMI. This interesting study confirms the truth of an erstwhile myth about penis size.\n\u2022 Nose size was a significant predictor of penile size.\n\u2022 The sizes of the penis and nose increased with a decrease in BMI.\n\u2022 This was an interesting study that confirmed the truth of an erstwhile myth.\nTraditionally, penile size has been associated with tremendous stamina and vitality. A small penis is associated with anxiety and dissatisfaction, whereas a large penis is generally associated with masculinity and strength (1). Various indicators and myths have been put forth in an attempt to predict the size of the penis, one of which is the ratio of the length of the fingers to the size of the nose (2,3). The ratio of the second to fourth digit length is lower in men than in...[Content truncated]",
