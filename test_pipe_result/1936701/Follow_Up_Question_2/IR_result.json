The guidelines are inspired by advertising standards in other industries with regulatory restrictions, such as the alcohol and pharmaceutical industries. While they do not mandate compliance, they could serve as a universal standard for cannabis brands to follow alongside state-specific regulations.\nCannabis Media Council’s guidelines are also aimed at supporting start-ups in the cannabis industry who may lack prior marketing experience. As the marketing of cannabis gains momentum, the guidelines are expected to evolve.\nOf course, cannabis is still a Schedule I drug to the US Federal government, which does supercede the Cannabis Media Council when it comes to radio. _Radio Ink_ asked broadcast attorney Frank Montero of Fletcher, Heald, and Hildreth what effect these new guidelines could have, and what radio stations need to consider.\n“I think the adoption of ethical marketing standards for cannabis is admirable,” said Montero. “However, broadcasters, in fact all advertiser-driven businesses need to remember that marijuana remains an illegal controlled substance under Federal law and, more importantly for those businesses, the publication of announcements advocating the use of illegal controlled substances is itself a potential felony under Federal law. The FCC has stated informally that broadcasters run such ads at their own peril, especially given a broadcaster’s reliance on a Federally-issued license to broadcast. In short, a state law legalizing marijuana or  compliance with an ethical marijuana marketing standard, is not a safe harbor.”\nShare via:\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \nPrevious article\nNext article\n#### \n]\n### \n]\n### \n]\n### \n### LEAVE A REPLY \nPlease enter your comment!\nPlease enter your name here\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\nPlease enter your email address here\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nΔ\n#### Free Daily Radio News\nDaily industry headlines plus breaking news bulletins.\n*   Email\\*\n*   Job Title\\*\n    Please choose an optionPresident/CEOMarket ManagerGeneral ManagerDirector of SalesSales ManagerProgramming / Ops ManagerAccount ExecutiveOn-Air / HostDigital ManagerMarketing ManagerNews DirectorProducerEngineerConsultantAdministrationLegal CounselOther\n*   Example: Consultant\n*   Company Name\\*\n*   CAPTCHA\n*   Phone\n    This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nΔ\n#### Our Print Magazine: Radio Ink\n**July 15,...[Content truncated]",

The guidelines are inspired by advertising standards in other industries with regulatory restrictions, such as the alcohol and pharmaceutical industries. While they do not mandate compliance, they could serve as a universal standard for cannabis brands to follow alongside state-specific regulations.\nCannabis Media Council’s guidelines are also aimed at supporting start-ups in the cannabis industry who may lack prior marketing experience. As the marketing of cannabis gains momentum, the guidelines are expected to evolve.\nOf course, cannabis is still a Schedule I drug to the US Federal government, which does supercede the Cannabis Media Council when it comes to radio. _Radio Ink_ asked broadcast attorney Frank Montero of Fletcher, Heald, and Hildreth what effect these new guidelines could have, and what radio stations need to consider.\n“I think the adoption of ethical marketing standards for cannabis is admirable,” said Montero. “However, broadcasters, in fact all advertiser-driven businesses need to remember that marijuana remains an illegal controlled substance under Federal law and, more importantly for those businesses, the publication of announcements advocating the use of illegal controlled substances is itself a potential felony under Federal law. The FCC has stated informally that broadcasters run such ads at their own peril, especially given a broadcaster’s reliance on a Federally-issued license to broadcast. In short, a state law legalizing marijuana or  compliance with an ethical marijuana marketing standard, is not a safe harbor.”\nShare via:\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \nPrevious article\nNext article\n#### \n]\n### \n]\n### \n]\n### \n### LEAVE A REPLY \nPlease enter your comment!\nPlease enter your name here\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\nPlease enter your email address here\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nΔ\n#### Free Daily Radio News\nDaily industry headlines plus breaking news bulletins.\n*   Email\\*\n*   Job Title\\*\n    Please choose an optionPresident/CEOMarket ManagerGeneral ManagerDirector of SalesSales ManagerProgramming / Ops ManagerAccount ExecutiveOn-Air / HostDigital ManagerMarketing ManagerNews DirectorProducerEngineerConsultantAdministrationLegal CounselOther\n*   Example: Consultant\n*   Company Name\\*\n*   CAPTCHA\n*   Phone\n    This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nΔ\n#### Our Print Magazine: Radio Ink\n**July 15,...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What specific daytime programming guidelines or regulations could apply to Bill Maher's on-air marijuana use?",
        "Answer": "Bill Maher's on-air marijuana use during a live broadcast could be evaluated under several specific daytime programming guidelines and regulations, particularly those enforced by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Key aspects include: 1. **Content Standards**: The FCC prohibits obscene, indecent, and profane content from being broadcast during certain hours, often referred to as the \"safe harbor\" periods that protect children from exposure to inappropriate content. While \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" airs later in the evening, the discussion of marijuana may still invoke scrutiny under FCC guidelines regarding indecent content. Indecent material is defined as content that portrays sexual or excretory organs or activities in a patently offensive way, which might be argued in the context of marijuana use. However, since cannabis is increasingly viewed as a culturally accepted subject and often discussed publicly, Maher's action might not trigger FCC action if deemed contextually appropriate within a political discourse. 2. **Regulatory Tolerance**: While marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance federally, the FCC has shown a level of tolerance towards discussions surrounding cannabis, especially as societal norms shift towards legalization. The Commission has historically not penalized programs that discuss marijuana in a responsible context, suggesting a recognition of changing public attitudes and a move away from stringent enforcement against marijuana-related content. 3. **Public Complaints and Subjectivity**: Enforcement of FCC guidelines often relies on public complaints. If viewers find Maher's actions objectionable, they could file complaints, prompting the FCC to review the content. The determination of whether the content was obscene or indecent can be subjective and depends on public perception and complaints received by the FCC. In conclusion, while there are regulatory frameworks that could potentially apply to Maher's on-air marijuana use, the lack of historical enforcement against such discussions during politically themed broadcasts and the shifting cultural landscape suggest that the FCC may not view this as a violation of daytime programming regulations.",
