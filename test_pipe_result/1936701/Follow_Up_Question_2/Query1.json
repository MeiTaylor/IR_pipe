The health and safety of every student at the University is of utmost importance. The University realizes that students who have been drinking alcohol and/or using drugs may be hesitant to report a situation where they or another student require help or medical assistance due to a fear of being found in violation of University policy. The University strongly encourages students to promptly report any incident where someone’s health may be at risk to University officials. Any student acting in good faith who discloses any incident where a student requires assistance due to alcohol or drug intake shall not be referred to the Student Conduct Process for an Alcohol or Drugs violation themselves, or for the students that they are with.\n3.  The right of a student to privacy and to study precedes a student’s privilege to consume alcohol in University housing.\n4.  Students 21 and older are permitted to have a quantity of alcohol for personal consumption limited to one (1) six-pack of beer, mixed seltzer, or cider OR one (1) bottle of wine (750 ml) in alcohol-eligible locations in University housing (see building eligibility below). **Hard liquor and grain alcohol are prohibited.**\n5.  Mass and expedited alcohol consumption containers, contraptions and games are prohibited from University housing (buildings, suites, apartments, bedrooms, bathrooms, common areas). These items include, but are not limited to kegs, beer balls, funnels, boxed wine, beer pong tables, drinking game paraphernalia, and other large quantities of alcohol.\n6.  If alcohol is present at a gathering in a student suite or apartment, drinking may not be the primary purpose of the function.\n7.  Alcohol consumption or having open containers in common spaces of University housing and its adjacent outdoor spaces is prohibited including, but not limited to laundry rooms, elevators, administrative offices, floor lounges, public bathrooms, trash rooms, hallways, prayer rooms, parking garages, etc.\n8.  Public intoxication is prohibited. Behaviors that are exacerbated by the use of alcohol and become problematic will be addressed by University personnel, and/or through the Office of Student Conduct.\n9.  Empty alcohol bottles, cans, etc. must be disposed of in a trash room, trash chute or proper receptacle and should not be left idle in student rooms for extended periods of time as they present a cleanliness hazard.\n10.  Alcohol may be stored in common area refrigerators (kitchen, common area in suite) if all of the students in the suite are 21 and older in an eligible building.
