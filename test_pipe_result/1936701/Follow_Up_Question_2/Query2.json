Get realistic market forecasts, state-by-state insights and benchmarks with the new 2024 MJBiz Factbook member program, now with quarterly updates. \n* * *\nMarijuana companies might soon have the option of running television advertisements  under a new bill advanced by the U.S. House Appropriations Committee.\nAccording to MediaPost, the House committee recently gave the measure – the 2023 Financial Services and General Government  – an initial thumbs-up, and the immense spending measure includes provisions that would protect broadcasters from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in states that have legalized marijuana.\nADVERTISEMENT\nCurrently, the FCC has the power to revoke the broadcasting licenses of TV and radio stations that run cannabis ads because marijuana remains a Schedule 1 controlled substance.\nThat’s why there’s been a  to date as opposed to in alt-weekly print newspapers, magazines, billboards and other advertising vehicles.\n### **2024 MJBiz Factbook – now available!**  \nExclusive industry data and analysis to help you make informed business decisions and avoid costly missteps. All the facts, none of the hype.\nFeatured inside:\n*   Financial forecasts + capital investment trends \n*   200+ pages and 49 charts highlighting key data figures and sales trends \n*   State-by-state guide to regulations, taxes & market opportunities\n*   Monthly and quarterly updates, with new data & insights\n*   And more!\nThe proposed appropriations bill would bar the FCC from using “any of the funds appropriated to the agency for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1 to deny broadcasters a license renewal or station sale application, or require an early license renewal application to be filed” in retaliation for carrying marijuana ads in states where the plant has been legalized, MediaPost reported.\nThe appropriations bill still must pass the full House and Senate, however, and the measure also doesn’t solve other federal bans on advertising for narcotics found in the Controlled Substances Act.\n#### Related Stories From MjBiz\n]\n]\n]\nLatest News\n-----------\n]\n###...[Content truncated]",

                    "content": "While Congress is considering a provision that would open up TV and radio advertising for cannabis companies, it’s likely just the start of a much longer discussion on how industry ads should be regulated.\nAs the United States Congress looks toward its end-of-year checklist, high in priority is the need to pass a new appropriations bill to fund the federal government for another fiscal year. Lawmakers recently passed a one-week extension to pass the bill, with a new deadline of Dec. 23. \nPart of that bill may enact a change to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) spending that would in practice allow cannabis companies to advertise on FCC-regulated television and radio broadcast networks, such as CBS and Clear Channel. \nIn July of 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill as part of its appropriations package that included a provision prohibiting the FCC from spending federal funding to stop cannabis companies from advertising in states with state-legal marijuana markets. The bill contains other provisions specific to the FCC approval process for broadcast companies and their advertising, but in short, the bill allows for advertising by cannabis companies on FCC-regulated television and radio networks.\nThe National Association of Broadcasters, a trade organization representing television and radio broadcasters, praised the bill when it passed. This is unsurprising given its passage would almost certainly unlock new advertising dollars for broadcasters.  Advertising dollars spent on television and radio ads combined have fallen to about half the value spent on digital advertising in recent years. According to a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers, digital advertising in the U.S. is expected to be a $200 billion industry in 2025, while TV will account for just $81 billion, and radio a meager $19 billion. And the gap between digital ad spend and broadcast ad spend is only expected to widen.  \nBroadcast networks, however, will not have much competition for cannabis advertising dollars from digital advertising services, as the major players currently prohibit the marketing of drugs and paraphernalia. Amazon, Alphabet (the parent company of Google) and Meta all have advertising policies that block the cannabis industry from tapping into their platforms, which are currently some of the most popular advertising platforms. Amazon recently reported it increased its global ad revenue from $19 billion to $31 billion from 2020 to 2021, and the three platforms are estimated to receive nearly 50% of...[Content truncated]",

Any broadcaster who is regulated by the FCC would be beholden to federal criminal law which clearly and unequivocally criminalizes marijuana and/or any attempt to sell marijuana in any state in the United States. The law that criminalizes marijuana in the United States is the US Controlled Substances Act Schedule I. Under this law, an attempt to market or sell marijuana is obviously a more serious crime in the United States. If a broadcaster has FCC dealings, they would definitely face a license challenge at the minimum. Potentially, there could definitely be criminal charges, as well. A company can be criminally charged in the United States, it happens all the time. Non humans are commonly prosecuted in the US. The standard is higher to prosecute criminal actions as opposed to civil actions. It would be easier to civilly regulate a broadcaster who could lose their association with the FCC than it would be to criminally charge the same actions. The standard of 51% or preponderance is easier to reach than beyond reasonable doubt. Marijuana crime is just easier to handle with civil action and limited judicial and regulatory resources. A violator is more likely to just go away in the face of a civil trial than they are when facing criminal charges, their risks are actually higher under a preponderance.\nHow might accepting cannabis or marijuana advertising impact a broadcaster's legal expenses?\nDespite all the lies told by drug addicts, people on pot do NOT have full...[Content truncated]",

It contends that without a waiver “Section 1802(b) of the Media Campaign Act and Section 317 of the Act will work at cross purposes.” 14 The Ad Council maintains that it is clear from the language of Section 1802(b) that it was Congress’ intent that the pre-existing pro bono program be preserved. According to the Ad Council, Congress adopted the matching program because it recognized “that a paid media campaign potentially could compete with and ultimately decrease donated time that also aims at reducing drug use” and it wanted to assure that the funds used in the Media Campaign Act did not supplant this donated time. 15 The Ad Council argues that requiring the ONDCP tag on match-PSAs will compromise the program and confuse the public. 11. Specifically, the Ad Council argues that such a requirement would cause undue economic hardship by imposing additional production costs on the organizations producing the PSAs due to the need to edit existing PSAs to include the ONDCP tag and because union-affiliated labor purportedly could no longer charge reduced wages for donated public service announcements production work. According to the Ad Council, “hese additional costs would substantially burden non-profit organizations and in all likelihood diminish the interest of those organizations in continuing to produce spots that would qualify under the match.” 16 It also contends that requiring the ONDCP tag on the match-PSAs would create public confusion: by giving “the impression that ONDCP controls and edits the match-PSAs, pays for them and is somehow associated with the message being communicated – an impression that could compromise such organization’s independence and potentially could undermine its ability to raise funds from its members;” and by having the ONDCP tag on a PSA when aired as part of the matching program and no ONDCP tag on the same PSA when aired independent of the program. 17 12. The Ad Council further asserts that grant of the waiver would promote the goals of Section 317 by accurately telling listeners who is persuading them, and conform to Commission precedent.

While they do not mandate compliance, they could serve as a universal standard for cannabis brands to follow alongside state-specific regulations.\nCannabis Media Council’s guidelines are also aimed at supporting start-ups in the cannabis industry who may lack prior marketing experience. As the marketing of cannabis gains momentum, the guidelines are expected to evolve.\nOf course, cannabis is still a Schedule I drug to the US Federal government, which does supercede the Cannabis Media Council when it comes to radio. _Radio Ink_ asked broadcast attorney Frank Montero of Fletcher, Heald, and Hildreth what effect these new guidelines could have, and what radio stations need to consider.\n“I think the adoption of ethical marketing standards for cannabis is admirable,” said Montero. “However, broadcasters, in fact all advertiser-driven businesses need to remember that marijuana remains an illegal controlled substance under Federal law and, more importantly for those businesses, the publication of announcements advocating the use of illegal controlled substances is itself a potential felony under Federal law. The FCC has stated informally that broadcasters run such ads at their own peril, especially given a broadcaster’s reliance on a Federally-issued license to broadcast. In short, a state law legalizing marijuana or  compliance with an ethical marijuana marketing standard, is not a safe harbor.”\nShare via:\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \nPrevious article\nNext article\n#### \n]\n### \n]\n### \n]\n### \n### LEAVE A REPLY \nPlease enter your comment!\nPlease enter your name here\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\nPlease enter your email address here\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nΔ\n#### Free Daily Radio News\nDaily industry headlines plus breaking news bulletins.\n*   Email\\*\n*   Job Title\\*\n    Please choose an optionPresident/CEOMarket ManagerGeneral ManagerDirector of SalesSales ManagerProgramming / Ops ManagerAccount ExecutiveOn-Air / HostDigital ManagerMarketing ManagerNews DirectorProducerEngineerConsultantAdministrationLegal CounselOther\n*   Example: Consultant\n*   Company Name\\*\n*   CAPTCHA\n*   Phone\n    This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\nΔ\n#### Our Print Magazine: Radio Ink\n**July 15,...[Content truncated]",
