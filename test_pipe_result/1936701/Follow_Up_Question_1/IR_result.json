But I do believe that treating this as a public-health issue, the same way we do with cigarettes or alcohol, is the much smarter way to deal with it.”\nObama has made comments to this effect before. In a 2014 interview with the New Yorker magazine he said that marijuana was less dangerous than alcohol “in terms of its impact on the individual consumer.” More recently, he told TV host Bill Maher, “I think we're going to have to have a more serious conversation about how we are treating marijuana and our drug laws generally.”\nIn the Rolling Stone interview published this week, Obama also reiterated his long-standing position that changing federal marijuana laws is not something the president can do unilaterally. “Typically how these classifications are changed are not done by presidential edict,” he said, “but are done either legislatively or through the DEA. As you might imagine, the DEA, whose job it is historically to enforce drug laws, is not always going to be on the cutting edge about these issues.”\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration recently turned down a petition to lessen federal restrictions on marijuana, citing the drug's lack of “accepted medical use” and its “high potential for abuse.” Congress...[Content truncated]",

Among youth, only decriminalization was associated with reductions in arrests and arrest disparities; cannabis arrests for adults and youth increased over time in states that did not implement a cannabis policy change.\n### Meaning\nThe study findings suggest that increases in arrest rate disparities in states without legalization or decriminalization highlight the need for targeted interventions to address racial injustice.\nAbstract\n--------\n### Importance\nDespite calls for cannabis decriminalization and legalization, research investigating the association of policy with arrest rates and racial disparities is scarce.\n### Objectives\nTo examine racial differences in cannabis arrest rates among adults and youths after statewide decriminalization, legalization, and no policy changes.\n### Design, Setting, and Participants\nThis case-control study used race-based arrest data from the Uniform Crime Reporting Program and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results county-level population data from January 2000 through December 2019. Data were analyzed in July 2021. Event-study analyses based on the arrest rates from 43 US states were conducted to compare preimplementation and postimplementation differences in arrest rates for states with decriminalization, legalization, and no policy changes.\n### Exposures\nNine states implemented legalization, 8 implemented decriminalization, and 26 had no policy change.\n### Main Outcomes and Measures\nOutcome measures were cannabis arrest rates for Black and White adults and youths per year and by state, while controlling for several covariates.\n### Results\nRates were reported per 100 000. When comparing absolute differences in arrests from January to December 2008 (before policy changes) to January to December 2019, legalization was associated with 561 and 195 fewer arrests and decriminalization with 448.6 and 117.1 fewer arrests for Black and White adults, respectively.

There have likely been thousands of entertainers and celebrities over the years who have gotten stoned prior to appearing on a television program, and who have been comfortable performing in front of a national audience while stoned.\nBut this was different. Here was a celebrity talk-show host on a major network, who, in the middle of his monologue on the need to legalize marijuana nationwide, pulled a joint out of his jacket pocket, lit it and began toking. It was, I presume, his way of demonstrating that smoking marijuana is no big deal, and does not cause the smoker to lose control or behave in an inappropriate manner. Maher completed his monologue, which was extraordinarily funny, and continued with his program, without the slightest indication he was impaired by his smoking.\n**Don’t Take Legalization for Granted**\nAlso, Maher clearly had a serious political purpose in mind when he decided to ignore the marijuana laws and light-up a joint on his show. He was using his monologue to remind his viewers that marijuana legalization does not occur without a lot of work from proponents in each individual state, and that none of us should presume the current political momentum will continue indefinitely. “Stop treating it like you could never lose it,” Maher warned.\nThat’s a message that resonates with those of us who lived through the 1970s, when, based on the report of the Marijuana Commission, we first decriminalized minor marijuana offenses in eleven states, and felt we were on the verge of winning nationwide. Instead, near the end of the decade the mood of the country turned far more conservative towards marijuana policy, with the rise of the parents’ movement and Nancy Reagan’s “Just Say No” campaign, and we saw our progress come to an abrupt halt. We failed to win another statewide marijuana reform measure for 18 years (until California legalized medical use in 1996).\nThere are important differences between those years and the current time, including an enormous increase in public support for legalization. In the 1970s, when we were winning decriminalization proposals at the state level, the Gallup Poll showed we enjoyed only about ...[Content truncated]"

But both of those numbers were sharply lower than pre-legalization numbers.  For instance, in 2010, 20% of 10th graders admitted to using cannabis in the past month.  In King County, the most populous in the state, only 5.5% of 10th graders reported recent cannabis use in 2023, down from 7.3% in 2021 and 18.1% in 2010.  Similar declines were observed in lifetime marijuana use across different grade levels surveyed, including 6th, 8th, and 12th grades.  \"In 2021, survey data showed a 50% decline in youth cannabis and alcohol use in the past 30-days among 10th graders. The 2023 results show these numbers have remained relatively stable\", said Kristen Haley, the state Liquor and Cannabis Board's (LCB) public health education liaison.  Health officials attribute the significant drops in substance use between 2018 and 2021 partly to the COVID-19 pandemic.  \"The COVID-19 pandemic brought with it a large decrease, roughly 50%, in most youth substance use. While the long-term impacts are unknown, in 2023 we see that substance use has remained relatively stable, both in Washington and nationally\", said Washington State's Department of Health.\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 41 secondsVolume 0%\nPressed by Maher whether that was an endorsement of federal cannabis legalization, Ramaswamy acknowledged that it was. “That’s what that means, yeah,” he replied.\nRamaswamy implied that because of the conflicting laws, law enforcement is able to target people almost indiscriminately.\n“When you have different standards of law, like, when you have that ‘Look the other way and sweep it under the rug,’ that’s when we actually get an unfair state that can target people for saying the wrong thing, thinking the wrong thing,” Ramaswamy said.\nMaher interjected to point out that “racism historically hid behind states’ rights,” but Ramaswamy downplayed the role of racism in America today.\n“This was part of our past,” he said, “and today I think it—you know, political discrimination, I think, is the new equivalent of unfairness in the law that we’ve seen for racism in maybe decades and centuries past...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What were the public and legal reactions following Bill Maher's on-air marijuana use during the broadcast?",
        "Answer": "Following Bill Maher's on-air marijuana use during the broadcast of \"Real Time with Bill Maher,\" the public and legal reactions could be characterized as largely supportive and notably forgiving, rather than punitive.\n\n1. **Public Support for Marijuana Legalization**: Maher's decision to smoke a joint during a segment focused on marijuana legalization was interpreted as a demonstration that using cannabis can be a responsible and casual act. He aimed to normalize marijuana use and illustrate its acceptance in contemporary society. This act resonated with audiences who support cannabis reform, as it aligned with the shifting public opinion towards marijuana legalization across the United States. The reaction from the audience seemed to be largely favorable, reinforcing acceptance rather than outrage over his actions.\n\n2. **Legal Tolerance and Lack of FCC Fines**: Despite the potentially controversial nature of smoking on live television, there were no significant legal repercussions following the incident. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) did not impose fines or take any formal action against Maher or his show. This lack of sanctions suggests that the act was either viewed as permissible or was tolerated within the context of the show’s format, which often engages in politically charged discussions. This absence of punitive measures implies a level of acceptance from regulatory bodies towards such expressions regarding marijuana use.\n\n3. **Political Messaging**: Maher also conveyed a political message regarding the importance of active participation in marijuana legalization efforts. He emphasized that marijuana legalization efforts require consistent advocacy and cautioned against taking progress for granted. This message was likely well-received by viewers and supporters of cannabis reform, aligning his actions with a broader sociopolitical struggle.\n\nIn summary, the public reaction appeared to be supportive, with Maher's act viewed as a statement of normalization of marijuana use, while legal reactions were non-existent or permissive, highlighting a significant cultural shift regarding cannabis in society.",
