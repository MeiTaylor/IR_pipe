There have likely been thousands of entertainers and celebrities over the years who have gotten stoned prior to appearing on a television program, and who have been comfortable performing in front of a national audience while stoned.\nBut this was different. Here was a celebrity talk-show host on a major network, who, in the middle of his monologue on the need to legalize marijuana nationwide, pulled a joint out of his jacket pocket, lit it and began toking. It was, I presume, his way of demonstrating that smoking marijuana is no big deal, and does not cause the smoker to lose control or behave in an inappropriate manner. Maher completed his monologue, which was extraordinarily funny, and continued with his program, without the slightest indication he was impaired by his smoking.\n**Don\u2019t Take Legalization for Granted**\nAlso, Maher clearly had a serious political purpose in mind when he decided to ignore the marijuana laws and light-up a joint on his show. He was using his monologue to remind his viewers that marijuana legalization does not occur without a lot of work from proponents in each individual state, and that none of us should presume the current political momentum will continue indefinitely. \u201cStop treating it like you could never lose it,\u201d Maher warned.\nThat\u2019s a message that resonates with those of us who lived through the 1970s, when, based on the report of the Marijuana Commission, we first decriminalized minor marijuana offenses in eleven states, and felt we were on the verge of winning nationwide. Instead, near the end of the decade the mood of the country turned far more conservative towards marijuana policy, with the rise of the parents\u2019 movement and Nancy Reagan\u2019s \u201cJust Say No\u201d campaign, and we saw our progress come to an abrupt halt. We failed to win another statewide marijuana reform measure for 18 years (until California legalized medical use in 1996).\nThere are important differences between those years and the current time, including an enormous increase in public support for legalization. In the 1970s, when we were winning decriminalization proposals at the state level, the Gallup Poll showed we enjoyed only about ...[Content truncated]",

Owen, Ph.D._  \n!\nIn Florida, a 14-year-old boy was admitted to the emergency room after experiencing seizures and difficulty breathing. He and his brother had smoked herbal incense, referred to by local police as Mr. Nice Guy.1 In another case, a 17-year-old boy in western Texas was hospitalized in May 2010 after smoking synthetic marijuana before school. After feeling sick on the bus ride to the campus, his symptoms became progressively worse. He was admitted to the hospital, treated, and released within the same day.2 Statistics indicated that emergency room visits across the country due to the use of synthetic marijuana have risen from 13 in 2009 to approximately 560 in the first half of 2010.3\nIn March 2011, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) temporarily placed five synthetic chemicals\u2014_JWH-018_; _JWH-073_; _JWH-200_; _CP-47, 497_; and _cannabicyclohexanol_\u2014into Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).4 These substances produce druglike effects that resemble those resulting from _tetrahydrocannabinol_ (THC), a _cannabanoid_ and the primary psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, but have distinct chemical structures.5 Individuals use them to coat herbal blends and then sell these products under such names as K2, Spice, Mr. Nice Guy, Genie, and others.6 Under the DEA\u2019s ruling, punishments for the possession or sale of these chemicals mirror those for marijuana. Law enforcement agencies should gain an understanding of synthetic marijuana, its distribution, potential harmful effects, and concerns for officers.\n**Definition**\nIn 1995, a Clemson University professor used a synthetic compound to conduct research identifying the effects on the brain from cannabinoids. Following the publication of a paper detailing the experiment, the description of the method and ingredients became popular among persons searching for a marijuana-like high. People began spraying the synthetic chemical compound described in the article on dry herbs and then smoking them as they would regular marijuana.7\n!\n##### Mr. Macher, a recent graduate from Radford University in Radford, Virginia, currently is studying law in North Carolina.  \n!\n##### Dr. Burke, a former police officer, serves as a professor of criminal justice and as associate dean for the College of Humanities and Behavioral Sciences at Radford University in Radford, Virginia.  \n!\n##### Dr. Owen is an associate professor of criminal justice and core director at Radford University in Radford, Virginia.  \nThe main chemical used to produce...[Content truncated]",

Focus areas include compounds emitted, air quality indoors and outdoors, odor assessment, and the potential health effects of emitted compounds. Studies suggest that \u03b2-myrcene is a tracer candidate for CCF biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). Furthermore, \u03b2-myrcene, d-limonene, terpinolene, and \u03b1-pinene are often reported in air samples collected in and around CCF facilities. The BVOC emission strength per dry weight of plant is higher than most conventional agriculture crops. Nevertheless, reported total CCF BVOC emissions are lower compared with VOCs from other industries. Common descriptors of odors coming from CCFs include \u201cskunky\u201d, \u201cherbal\u201d, and \u201cpungent\u201d. However, there are few peer-reviewed studies addressing the odor impacts of CCFs outdoors. Atmospheric modeling has been limited to back trajectory models of tracers and ozone impact ass",

These two defenses require a case by case evaluation of each person =s abilities and limitations with regard to the specific job in question. \nIn addition, an employer may discriminate against a whole group of persons with disabilities if the absence of a particular disability is a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ). For example, an employer may be able to refuse to hire any person with back problems for a job which requires heavy lifting. However, employers can rely upon a BFOQ defense to exclude a group of people only if the employer can prove that all or almost all members of the excluded group cannot presently perform the job in a safe manner. ( Sterling Transit Co. v. Fair Employment Practice Commission (1981) 121 Cal.App3d 791.) \nD. Employers Must Make Reasonable Accommodations \nEmployers must make reasonable accommodations for applicants and employees with disabilities, unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the employer. Examples of reasonable accommodations include making facilities accessible and restructuring jobs, which might include reassigning or transferring an employee, developing part-time or modified work schedules, acquiring or modifying equipment, minor restructuring of the work site, and providing readers or interpreters. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, ' 7293.9.) \nE. Nondiscrimination in Recruitment and Testing \nEmployers must give equal consideration to individuals with disabilities in recruitment activities and are required to make reasonable accommodations during the recruitment process. For example, \n## 2during the interview process, employers may be required to provide interpreters for individuals with hearing impairments or provide rooms which are accessible to wheelchairs. Employers may not ask general questions about an applicant's physical or mental condition. Specific questions about an applicant's present physical or mental fitness, medical condition, physical condition or medical history are permissible only if they are directly related to the job in question. An employer may only make an inquiry or conduct an examination after an offer of employment has been made, provided that it is job-related and consistent with business necessity, and that all entering employees in similar positions are subjected to the same inquiry or exam. An individual who would be disqualified from employment as a result of a physical exam must be allowed to submit independent medical opinions for consideration before a final determination is made. The exam results are confidential; however, supervisors may be informed of restrictions on or accommodations with respect to an individual's duties, and first aid and safety personnel may be informed of the condition if the condition may require emergency treatment.

Schauer, PhD, MPH, 1107 NE 45th St, Seattle, WA 98105, USA (e-mail: schauerg@uw.edu). This manuscript was submitted before legalization of adult use cannabis in New York State (March 2021), Virginia (April 2021), New Mexico (April 2021), and Connecticut (June 2021). \n# Abstract \nAbstract Introduction As of January 2021, a total of 36 states and the District of Columbia (DC) have legalized medical cannabis use, and 14 states and DC have legalized adult nonmedical use. This manuscript qualitatively summarizes cannabis policies across states with legal adult use marketplaces. \nMethods Data are from state laws and regulations, collected through January 2021, and have been verified with state officials as part of ongoing state policy tracking efforts. \nResults State policies differ in how cannabis products are taxed, where revenues are allocated, restrictions on the types of available products, restrictions on additives and flavors, product packaging and labeling, advertising restrictions, where cannabis can be consumed, and approaches to social equity. \nConclusion Timely, accurate, and longitudinal state and local cannabis policy data are needed to understand the implications of legalization. Careful study of policy differences across and within states is warranted, as differences may affect public health and consumer safety. \n# Introduction \nAlthough cannabis with \u00150.3% delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration (also called marijuana) remains a Schedule I substance in the United States under the 1970 US Controlled Substances Act (1), state policies legalizing cannabis for medical and nonmedical use have increased rapidly over the past de-cade.

Among youth, only decriminalization was associated with reductions in arrests and arrest disparities; cannabis arrests for adults and youth increased over time in states that did not implement a cannabis policy change.\n### Meaning\nThe study findings suggest that increases in arrest rate disparities in states without legalization or decriminalization highlight the need for targeted interventions to address racial injustice.\nAbstract\n--------\n### Importance\nDespite calls for cannabis decriminalization and legalization, research investigating the association of policy with arrest rates and racial disparities is scarce.\n### Objectives\nTo examine racial differences in cannabis arrest rates among adults and youths after statewide decriminalization, legalization, and no policy changes.\n### Design, Setting, and Participants\nThis case-control study used race-based arrest data from the Uniform Crime Reporting Program and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results county-level population data from January 2000 through December 2019. Data were analyzed in July 2021. Event-study analyses based on the arrest rates from 43 US states were conducted to compare preimplementation and postimplementation differences in arrest rates for states with decriminalization, legalization, and no policy changes.\n### Exposures\nNine states implemented legalization, 8 implemented decriminalization, and 26 had no policy change.\n### Main Outcomes and Measures\nOutcome measures were cannabis arrest rates for Black and White adults and youths per year and by state, while controlling for several covariates.\n### Results\nRates were reported per 100\u2009000. When comparing absolute differences in arrests from January to December 2008 (before policy changes) to January to December 2019, legalization was associated with 561 and 195 fewer arrests and decriminalization with 448.6 and 117.1 fewer arrests for Black and White adults, respectively. States without a policy change saw reductions of 47.5 and ...[Content truncated]",
