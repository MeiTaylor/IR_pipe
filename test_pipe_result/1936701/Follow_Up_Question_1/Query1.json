But both of those numbers were sharply lower than pre-legalization numbers.  For instance, in 2010, 20% of 10th graders admitted to using cannabis in the past month.  In King County, the most populous in the state, only 5.5% of 10th graders reported recent cannabis use in 2023, down from 7.3% in 2021 and 18.1% in 2010.  Similar declines were observed in lifetime marijuana use across different grade levels surveyed, including 6th, 8th, and 12th grades.  \"In 2021, survey data showed a 50% decline in youth cannabis and alcohol use in the past 30-days among 10th graders. The 2023 results show these numbers have remained relatively stable\", said Kristen Haley, the state Liquor and Cannabis Board's (LCB) public health education liaison.  Health officials attribute the significant drops in substance use between 2018 and 2021 partly to the COVID-19 pandemic.  \"The COVID-19 pandemic brought with it a large decrease, roughly 50%, in most youth substance use. While the long-term impacts are unknown, in 2023 we see that substance use has remained relatively stable, both in Washington and nationally\", said Washington State's Department of Health.\n0 seconds of 1 minute, 41 secondsVolume 0%\nPressed by Maher whether that was an endorsement of federal cannabis legalization, Ramaswamy acknowledged that it was. “That’s what that means, yeah,” he replied.\nRamaswamy implied that because of the conflicting laws, law enforcement is able to target people almost indiscriminately.\n“When you have different standards of law, like, when you have that ‘Look the other way and sweep it under the rug,’ that’s when we actually get an unfair state that can target people for saying the wrong thing, thinking the wrong thing,” Ramaswamy said.\nMaher interjected to point out that “racism historically hid behind states’ rights,” but Ramaswamy downplayed the role of racism in America today.\n“This was part of our past,” he said, “and today I think it—you know, political discrimination, I think, is the new equivalent of unfairness in the law that we’ve seen for racism in maybe decades and centuries past...[Content truncated]",

There have likely been thousands of entertainers and celebrities over the years who have gotten stoned prior to appearing on a television program, and who have been comfortable performing in front of a national audience while stoned.\nBut this was different. Here was a celebrity talk-show host on a major network, who, in the middle of his monologue on the need to legalize marijuana nationwide, pulled a joint out of his jacket pocket, lit it and began toking. It was, I presume, his way of demonstrating that smoking marijuana is no big deal, and does not cause the smoker to lose control or behave in an inappropriate manner. Maher completed his monologue, which was extraordinarily funny, and continued with his program, without the slightest indication he was impaired by his smoking.\n**Don’t Take Legalization for Granted**\nAlso, Maher clearly had a serious political purpose in mind when he decided to ignore the marijuana laws and light-up a joint on his show. He was using his monologue to remind his viewers that marijuana legalization does not occur without a lot of work from proponents in each individual state, and that none of us should presume the current political momentum will continue indefinitely. “Stop treating it like you could never lose it,” Maher warned.\nThat’s a message that resonates with those of us who lived through the 1970s, when, based on the report of the Marijuana Commission, we first decriminalized minor marijuana offenses in eleven states, and felt we were on the verge of winning nationwide. Instead, near the end of the decade the mood of the country turned far more conservative towards marijuana policy, with the rise of the parents’ movement and Nancy Reagan’s “Just Say No” campaign, and we saw our progress come to an abrupt halt. We failed to win another statewide marijuana reform measure for 18 years (until California legalized medical use in 1996).\nThere are important differences between those years and the current time, including an enormous increase in public support for legalization. In the 1970s, when we were winning decriminalization proposals at the state level, the Gallup Poll showed we enjoyed only about 28%...[Content truncated]",

I took another pull from my hand-held vaporiser, assumed the degrading position for a second time, and blew warm, skunky air into the toilet. I felt like a fucking idiot. _Don’t do drugs_, I’ll tell my future children. _You’ll look like an ass_.\nMy dad tried to tell me that once. After the cops busted me, at 17, for smoking weed, he looked at me and shook his head. Weed isn’t evil or terrible, he said, but it’s not worth the risk. He’d worked hard to raise lower-middle-class kids. We’d have to do the same, or better, to keep our status. A record, some big fines, could easily start a descent. Unless you live in Washington or Colorado, or somewhere else where weed is legal in one way or another, you have to give it up if you want peace of mind, or else get damn good at hiding it.\nA whole line of products has developed around the idea of ‘stealth smoking’ and getting secretly high. When _Aeon_ asked me to write a story about sneak-a-toke tools, I decided the subject needed first-person reporting. I bought my own high-tech device, a Magic-Flight Launch Box, with the intent of getting high on the sly in public. I wasn’t disappointed. It’s a nifty contraption. A tiny wood block, slightly larger than a matchbox, with a weed hole in the middle and a removable cover. Push down the rechargeable battery and, _voila_, vaporised, smoothly inhalable THC (tetrahydrocannabinol, the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis). The smell doesn’t linger like regular weed smoke. Afterward, all you need is a mint.\nCosting roughly $100, the Magic-Flight is more expensive (but less risky) than many other stealth devices that burn weed in the traditional sense. And it’s cheaper than the e‑cigarette vaporisers (or vapes) that use capsules of THC oil, which are difficult to obtain if you aren’t dangerously familiar with the illicit drugs game. Made in San Diego, the Magic-Flight is a product both of necessity and convenience, and it’s one of the most popular portable vapes on the market. Hippyish, feel-good aphorisms are carved into the wood, as inspirational and profound as the mantras on organic food packaging. The Magic-Flight is drug paraphernalia for the middle class, and comes with a lifetime warranty.\nThis...[Content truncated]",

New Zealand will hold a public referendum on cannabis legalisation in 2020. We reviewed data on cannabis use and health/social harms; policy reform options; experiences with and outcomes of reforms elsewhere; and other relevant considerations towards informing policy choices in the upcoming referendum.\n### Approach\nRelevant epidemiological, health, social, criminal justice and policy studies and data were identified and comprehensively reviewed.\n### Key Findings\nCannabis use is common (including in New Zealand) and associated with risks for health and social harms, mainly concentrated in young users; key harms are attributable to criminalisation. ‘Decriminalisation’ reforms have produced ambivalent results. Existing cannabis legalisation frameworks vary considerably in main parameters. Legalisation offers some distinct advantages, for example regulated use, products and user education, yet outcomes depend on essential regulation parameters, including commercialisation, and policy ecologies. While major changes in use are not observed, legalisation experiences are inconclusive to date, including mixed health and social outcomes, with select harms increasing and resilient illegal markets. It is unclear whether legalisation reduces cannabis exposure or social harms (e.g. from enforcement) for youth.\n### Imp...[Content truncated]",

I hurried past Penn’s three surfboards and silver Airstream in the front yard, half expecting to see the un-pacific denizen of the Pacific Coast wrestling on the floor with the photographer.\nNah. Penn, in dark T-shirt, Columbia utility pants and sneakers, was charming, trailed by his adoring dogs, a golden retriever and a German shepherd rescue puppy.\nWhen I joked that I was relieved to see him treating the photographer sweetly, he laughed. “When I did my 23andMe,” he said, “I thought I might be part Hopi because they don’t like to be photographed.”\nPenn, a lifelong Malibu resident, pointed in the direction of his old grade school in the days of a more rural Malibu. He said he gets up at 5:30 a.m. and goes, barefoot, out to his wood shop. “I even forget to smoke for five hours.”\nAs it turns out, Penn has finally mellowed.\nAt 63, the weathered, tattooed rebel with many causes is a certified humanitarian — riding the crest into dangerous crises around the globe and saving lives in New Orleans and Haiti after disasters — and a crusading documentarian. He started out making the documentary “Superpower,” thinking it would be a story of how Volodymyr Zelensky, a comedian, ascended to Ukraine’s presidency.

You’re Not More Creative on Pot, Research Shows – You Just Think You Are\n================================================================================\n*   By , \nOctober 27, 2022\n ! Facebook!

LinkedIn Email\n!Photo illustration by Emily Faith Morgan, University Communications\n!\nThe longstanding popular conception that marijuana use makes people more creative has just gone up in smoke, at least according to one recent study.\nA University of Virginia researcher and her colleagues who theorized that joviality induced by marijuana would increase creativity have found no positive effects. However, when the research participants assessed their work and the work of others while under the influence, the participants thought more highly.\n“While we expected that cannabis-induced joviality would result in people thinking that their ideas and others’ ideas are more creative, we were surprised that cannabis-induced joviality did not lead to more actual creativity,” said lead author Yu Tse Heng, an assistant professor in the McIntire School of Commerce.\nThe paper was published this summer in the Journal of Applied Psychology. Heng and her co-authors, business professors Christopher M. Barnes of the University of Washington and Kai Chi Yam of the National University of Singapore, are now using the paper as a springboard to discuss the implications of marijuana use in the workplace.  appeared in the Harvard Business Review on Monday.\n### **The 411 on the 420 Study**\nThe study, based on the survey responses of several hundred individuals in Washington State, looked at two groups of self-reported “light” marijuana users, defined as smoking one joint several times a week.\n!Yu Tse Heng is an assistant commerce professor interested in workplace dynamics.

They needed to come up with as many creative ideas as possible.\nBut the researchers ultimately were looking for quality over quantity from the groups. The ideas needed to...[Content truncated]",
