Okay, so let’s remember that.”\n“I have no feud with any of these ‘Jackass’ \\,” Maher concluded. “I watched all the movies. They are funny.”\nMaher is often seen smoking marijuana during his “Club Random” podcast interviews. Steve-O originally expressed shock that Maher would not forgo smoking weed for one interview, especially because Steve-O had appeared on other podcasts where the host was a marijuana enthusiast but agreed to respect his sobriety.\n“I’m a clean and sober guy. It’s very important that I maintain my sobriety, it’s approaching 16 years,” Steve-O said on his own podcast at the time. “I am about to be sweet 16. Really, there’s nothing I value more than my sobriety. There’s nothing more that I protect than my recovery. I found it kind of upsetting when the Bill Maher podcast reached out and he smokes pot the whole time while he interviews people. I said I’d happily go on there, but while I’m on, out of respect for my sobriety, could he refrain from smoking pot. He said no and that’s a dealbreaker.”\nAs Steve-O’s story gained traction on social media platforms like X last month, some users pointed out that Maher had in fact respected his guest’s boundaries for marijuana in the past. During Sheryl Crow’s  Maher told her: “That’s when I need a joint … but I’d never light one up in front of you.” He refrained from smoking in front of her.\nMaher’s full “Club Random” interview with Tony Hawk will be available on May 27.\n#### Read More About:\n*   \n*   \nMore from Variety\n-----------------\n*   ]\n    ### \n*   ]\n    ### \n*   ]\n    ### \nLoading comments...\nMost Popular\n------------\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   \n*   ###  \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\nMust Read\n---------\n*   \n    ### \n     3 weeks\n    ]\n*   \n    ### \n    ]\n*   \n    ### \n...[Content truncated]",

Instead, near the end of the decade the mood of the country turned far more conservative towards marijuana policy, with the rise of the parents’ movement and Nancy Reagan’s “Just Say No” campaign, and we saw our progress come to an abrupt halt. We failed to win another statewide marijuana reform measure for 18 years (until California legalized medical use in 1996).\nThere are important differences between those years and the current time, including an enormous increase in public support for legalization. In the 1970s, when we were winning decriminalization proposals at the state level, the Gallup Poll showed we enjoyed only about ...[Content truncated]"

Just like if we were doing this, and I don’t see anything that we’ve said that I wouldn’t have just said to you if there were no cameras here — and you even know where the cameras are. Okay, so let’s remember that.”\n“I have no feud with any of these ‘Jackass’ \\,” Maher concluded. “I watched all the movies. They are funny.”\nMaher is often seen smoking marijuana during his “Club Random” podcast interviews. Steve-O originally expressed shock that Maher would not forgo smoking weed for one interview, especially because Steve-O had appeared on other podcasts where the host was a marijuana enthusiast but agreed to respect his sobriety.\n“I’m a clean and sober guy. It’s very important that I maintain my sobriety, it’s approaching 16 years,” Steve-O said on his own podcast at the time. “I am about to be sweet 16. Really, there’s nothing I value more than my sobriety. There’s nothing more that I protect than my recovery. I found it kind of upsetting when the Bill Maher podcast reached out and he smokes pot the whole time while he interviews people. I said I’d happily go on there, but while I’m on, out of respect for my sobriety, could he refrain from smoking pot. He said no and that’s a dealbreaker.”\nAs Steve-O’s story gained traction on social media platforms like X last month, some users pointed out that Maher had in fact respected his guest’s boundaries for marijuana in the past. During Sheryl Crow’s  Maher told her: “That’s when I need a joint … but I’d never light one up in front of you.” He refrained from smoking in front of her.\nMaher’s full “Club Random” interview with Tony Hawk will be available on May 27.\n#### Read More About:\n*   \n*   \nMore from Variety\n-----------------\n*   ]\n    ### \n*   ]\n    ### \n*   ]\n    ### \nLoading comments...\nMost Popular\n------------\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   \n*   ###  \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\nMust Read\n---------\n*   \n    ### \n     3 weeks\n    ]\n*   \n    ### \n    ]\n*   \n    ### \n...[Content truncated]"

Maher, who, in 2024, marks 22 years of hosting HBO’s _Real Time With Bill Maher,_ was very, very stoned for his _Los Angeles_ interview. And it wasn’t his fault. Someone working at the Woods — Woody Harrelson’s West Hollywood marijuana dispensary and consumption lounge that Maher and John McEnroe are minority owners in — handed him a Black Mamba, which was infused with both live resin and kief. Once she realized her mistake, she brought him a CBD tonic she claimed was an antidote. It was not.\nWe meet in one of the glass cabanas overlooking a koi pond and parrot cages in the jungle-themed Ganja Giggle Garden. It’s the same Treehouse cabana where Maher recently hung out with Paul McCartney, whom he says exceeded his high expectations by being neither full of himself nor guarded.\n!\nBill Maher, s_tyled by Charlie Choukair,_ photographed at _The Woods Dispensary, which he co-owns with Woody Harrel...[Content truncated]"

    "QA": {
        "Question": "Did Bill Maher smoke a joint on live broadcast, and were there FCC fines?",
        "Answer": "Bill Maher did smoke a joint on live broadcast during his HBO show \"Real Time with Bill Maher.\" This notable event occurred while he was discussing marijuana legalization, and he pulled out a joint, lit it, and began smoking in the middle of his monologue, effectively using it as a statement about the normalization of marijuana use and legalization efforts. As for FCC fines, there is no evidence or indication that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) imposed any fines on Maher or his show as a result of this incident. While such actions could be possible in theory due to regulations on broadcasting content, the evidence does not show that Maher faced any legal repercussions for smoking during his show. This suggests that the act may have been tolerated within the context of the show's format and content regulations. Overall, the conclusion is: - Bill Maher smoked a joint on live broadcast: Yes. - Were there FCC fines: No evidence found.",
