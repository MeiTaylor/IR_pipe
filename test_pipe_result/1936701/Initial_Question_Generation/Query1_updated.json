Although the Court acknowledged that States had a legitimate interest in protecting \u201cpotential life,\u201d 1 it found that this interest could not justify any restriction on pre -\nviability abortions.

Noem has signed the new law banning the sale of specific hemp-derived products?\nIn recent years, businesses have made the product a large portion of their business model, and various products can also be found at \u201csmoke shops\u201d and convenience stores.\nSouth Dakota has outlawed intoxicating hemp products. Governor Kristi Noem signed a law aimed at eliminating all products containing synthetic compounds like delta-8 THC from the market. The law prohibits the production, sale, and distribution of \u201cchemically modified or converted industrial hemp,\u201d including delta-8 THC, delta-9 THC derived from hemp, delta-10 THC, THC-O-acetate, HHC, THCP, and any other THC isomer, analog, or derivative.\nThe law targets products such as gummies, vape pens, pre-rolled joints, and smokable flowers, often referred to as \u201cdiet weed\u201d or \u201cmarijuana light.\u201d These products have become widespread in South Dakota and across the U.S., exploiting loopholes in the 2018 U.S. Farm Bill.\nAll banned substances are synthetically produced, primarily by chemically processing CBD from hemp flowers. Health officials have warned that these compounds lack federal regulation and are essentially unregulated products. Some have shown inconsistent levels of intoxicants and contaminants, leading to instances of illness, hospital visits, and even a child\u2019s death.\nThe 2018 Farm Bill, which federally legalized hemp and its derivatives, failed to account...[Content truncated]",

And it has nothing to do with Adolf Hitler\u2019s birthday.\nThe real story apparently traces back to northern California. It's a tale involving dairy pioneer Louis Pasteur, the Grateful Dead and five high school athletes.\nIn 2002, an article by Steven Hager, editor of High Times magazine, claimed he had been contacted by a group of people calling themselves the \u201cWaldos,\u201d who claimed they were responsible for the origins of 4/20. The anonymous members of the group told Hager that in 1971, they were students at San Rafael High School and would meet every day at 4:20 p.m. to smoke marijuana.\nThe High Times article was mostly vague but it was used as a starting point by Huffington Post writers Ryan Grim and Carly Schwartz, who investigated the legend further, leading to an extensive origin story published in 2009.\nThe Huffington Post identified the so-called \u201cWaldos\u201d and corroborated their story.

Drugs and guns is never a good combination,\u201d said Trotwood Police Chief Erik Wilson.\nAccording to the Secretary of State\u2019s website, Goldwasser Smoke and Vape LLC filed the fictitious name Best Buds Depot on Jan. 20 of this year.

They have this on their website. Currently, there are no individuals or entities licensed to sell non-medical cannabis in the state of Ohio and any sale of marijuana prior to non-medical licenses being issued may be subject to criminal penalties,\u201d said Wilson.\n...[Content truncated]",
