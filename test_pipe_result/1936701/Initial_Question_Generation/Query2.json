I don't want to start a feud, and I'm sorry that he felt slighted or something, but it is ridiculous that somebody thinks that I should give up pot smoking because they have a problem. Then I'm sorry you can't be here.\"\n\n\n\nMaher noted that the \"Club Random\" podcast is his house and so the guests have to play by \"my rules.\"\n\n\n\n\"I already have another show.

Just like if we were doing this, and I don’t see anything that we’ve said that I wouldn’t have just said to you if there were no cameras here — and you even know where the cameras are. Okay, so let’s remember that.”\n“I have no feud with any of these ‘Jackass’ \\,” Maher concluded. “I watched all the movies. They are funny.”\nMaher is often seen smoking marijuana during his “Club Random” podcast interviews. Steve-O originally expressed shock that Maher would not forgo smoking weed for one interview, especially because Steve-O had appeared on other podcasts where the host was a marijuana enthusiast but agreed to respect his sobriety.\n“I’m a clean and sober guy. It’s very important that I maintain my sobriety, it’s approaching 16 years,” Steve-O said on his own podcast at the time. “I am about to be sweet 16. Really, there’s nothing I value more than my sobriety. There’s nothing more that I protect than my recovery. I found it kind of upsetting when the Bill Maher podcast reached out and he smokes pot the whole time while he interviews people. I said I’d happily go on there, but while I’m on, out of respect for my sobriety, could he refrain from smoking pot. He said no and that’s a dealbreaker.”\nAs Steve-O’s story gained traction on social media platforms like X last month, some users pointed out that Maher had in fact respected his guest’s boundaries for marijuana in the past. During Sheryl Crow’s  Maher told her: “That’s when I need a joint … but I’d never light one up in front of you.” He refrained from smoking in front of her.\nMaher’s full “Club Random” interview with Tony Hawk will be available on May 27.\n#### Read More About:\n*   \n*   \nMore from Variety\n-----------------\n*   ]\n    ### \n*   ]\n    ### \n*   ]\n    ### \nLoading comments...\nMost Popular\n------------\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   \n*   ###  \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\nMust Read\n---------\n*   \n    ### \n     3 weeks\n    ]\n*   \n    ### \n    ]\n*   \n    ### \n...[Content truncated]",

There have likely been thousands of entertainers and celebrities over the years who have gotten stoned prior to appearing on a television program, and who have been comfortable performing in front of a national audience while stoned.\nBut this was different. Here was a celebrity talk-show host on a major network, who, in the middle of his monologue on the need to legalize marijuana nationwide, pulled a joint out of his jacket pocket, lit it and began toking. It was, I presume, his way of demonstrating that smoking marijuana is no big deal, and does not cause the smoker to lose control or behave in an inappropriate manner. Maher completed his monologue, which was extraordinarily funny, and continued with his program, without the slightest indication he was impaired by his smoking.\n**Don’t Take Legalization for Granted**\nAlso, Maher clearly had a serious political purpose in mind when he decided to ignore the marijuana laws and light-up a joint on his show. He was using his monologue to remind his viewers that marijuana legalization does not occur without a lot of work from proponents in each individual state, and that none of us should presume the current political momentum will continue indefinitely. “Stop treating it like you could never lose it,” Maher warned.\nThat’s a message that resonates with those of us who lived through the 1970s, when, based on the report of the Marijuana Commission, we first decriminalized minor marijuana offenses in eleven states, and felt we were on the verge of winning nationwide. Instead, near the end of the decade the mood of the country turned far more conservative towards marijuana policy, with the rise of the parents’ movement and Nancy Reagan’s “Just Say No” campaign, and we saw our progress come to an abrupt halt. We failed to win another statewide marijuana reform measure for 18 years (until California legalized medical use in 1996).\nThere are important differences between those years and the current time, including an enormous increase in public support for legalization. In the 1970s, when we were winning decriminalization proposals at the state level, the Gallup Poll showed we enjoyed only about ...[Content truncated]",
