It was not.\nWe meet in one of the glass cabanas overlooking a koi pond and parrot cages in the jungle-themed Ganja Giggle Garden.

Okay, so let\u2019s remember that.\u201d\n\u201cI have no feud with any of these \u2018Jackass\u2019 \\,\u201d Maher concluded. \u201cI watched all the movies. They are funny.\u201d\nMaher is often seen smoking marijuana during his \u201cClub Random\u201d podcast interviews. Steve-O originally expressed shock that Maher would not forgo smoking weed for one interview, especially because Steve-O had appeared on other podcasts where the host was a marijuana enthusiast but agreed to respect his sobriety.\n\u201cI\u2019m a clean and sober guy. It\u2019s very important that I maintain my sobriety, it\u2019s approaching 16 years,\u201d Steve-O said on his own podcast at the time. \u201cI am about to be sweet 16. Really, there\u2019s nothing I value more than my sobriety. There\u2019s nothing more that I protect than my recovery. I found it kind of upsetting when the Bill Maher podcast reached out and he smokes pot the whole time while he interviews people. I said I\u2019d happily go on there, but while I\u2019m on, out of respect for my sobriety, could he refrain from smoking pot. He said no and that\u2019s a dealbreaker.\u201d\nAs Steve-O\u2019s story gained traction on social media platforms like X last month, some users pointed out that Maher had in fact respected his guest\u2019s boundaries for marijuana in the past. During Sheryl Crow\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0Maher told her: \u201cThat\u2019s when I need a joint \u2026 but I\u2019d never light one up in front of you.\u201d He refrained from smoking in front of her.\nMaher\u2019s full \u201cClub Random\u201d interview with Tony Hawk will be available on May 27.\n#### Read More About:\n*   \n*   \nMore from Variety\n-----------------\n*   ]\n    ### \n*   ]\n    ### \n*   ]\n    ### \nLoading comments...\nMost Popular\n------------\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   \n*   ### \u00a0\n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\n*   ### \n    ]\nMust Read\n---------\n*   \n    ### \n     3 weeks\n    ]\n*   \n    ### \n    ]\n*   \n    ### \n...[Content truncated]",

There have likely been thousands of entertainers and celebrities over the years who have gotten stoned prior to appearing on a television program, and who have been comfortable performing in front of a national audience while stoned.\nBut this was different. Here was a celebrity talk-show host on a major network, who, in the middle of his monologue on the need to legalize marijuana nationwide, pulled a joint out of his jacket pocket, lit it and began toking. It was, I presume, his way of demonstrating that smoking marijuana is no big deal, and does not cause the smoker to lose control or behave in an inappropriate manner. Maher completed his monologue, which was extraordinarily funny, and continued with his program, without the slightest indication he was impaired by his smoking.\n**Don\u2019t Take Legalization for Granted**\nAlso, Maher clearly had a serious political purpose in mind when he decided to ignore the marijuana laws and light-up a joint on his show.

Instead, near the end of the decade the mood of the country turned far more conservative towards marijuana policy, with the rise of the parents\u2019 movement and Nancy Reagan\u2019s \u201cJust Say No\u201d campaign, and we saw our progress come to an abrupt halt. We failed to win another statewide marijuana reform measure for 18 years (until California legalized medical use in 1996).\nThere are important differences between those years and the current time, including an enormous increase in public support for legalization. In the 1970s, when we were winning decriminalization proposals at the state level, the Gallup Poll showed we enjoyed only about ...[Content truncated]",
