As a new dad and a PhD student studying environmental nanotechnology, plastic was on his mind. The year before, scientists had  that plastic baby bottles shed millions of particles into formula, which infants end up swallowing (while also sucking on plastic bottle nipples). “At that time,” Hussain says, “I was purchasing many baby foods, and I was seeing that, even in baby foods, there are a lot of plastics.”\nHussain wanted to know how much was being released from the kinds of containers he’d been buying. So he went to the grocery store, picked up some baby food, and brought the empty containers back to his lab at the University of Nebraska—Lincoln. In a study published in June in , Hussain and his colleagues reported that, when microwaved, these containers released millions of bits of plastic, called microplastics, and even tinier nanoplastics.\nPlastics are complex cocktails of long chains of carbon, called polymers, mixed in with chemical additives, small molecules that help mold the polymers into their final shape and imbue them with resistance to oxidation, UV exposure, and other wear and tear.

In 2019  calculated we might be ingesting about 50,000 microplastic particles per year.\nThe health impacts of eating plastic is still unclear, but researchers have long suspected they’re not great. And  suggests high exposure to microplastics (and the lengthy list of chemicals they’re made from) could provoke immune and stress responses, along with various reproductive, metabolic, and behavioral issues.\nGiven the mounting concern around one of , Hussain’s findings beg a timely question: Can you put plastic in the microwave?\nWhat does microwaving do to plastic?\n------------------------------------\nPlastics are spaghetti-like chains of carbon molecules, called polymers, which are usually derived from crude oil. To make plastics that are clear, cloudy, rigid, or soft, manufacturers add a cocktail of chemicals. Though there are , the most well-studied groups are:  (which include  and are often found in rigid products, like food storage containers and water pipes) and  (which are typically used to make , such as food prep gloves or the plastic lining inside a milk carton).\nAs Hussain found, microplastics and chemicals can build up in your leftovers over time—even when you’re storing those plastic containers in the fridge. But microwaving wet foods in plastic delivers : Heat speeds up hydrolysis, the process by which water molecules can essentially break chemical bonds apart. This supercharged reaction causes plastic containers to shed microplastics and nanoplastics, as well as leach chemical additives (the bisphenols, phthalates, and more), into your food. And once those microplastics are ingested, it’s possible they can degrade and also .\n]\nIn other words, heating plastic essentially makes it softer and more porous. If you’ve ever microwaved marinara sauce in a plastic bowl, you’ve seen the sunset red, impossible-to-remove stain it leaves behind. “Passages in the plastic can open up, so the sauce gets inside,” says James Rogers, PhD the director of food safety research and testing at . The opposite exchange happens too: “If something goes in, something can also come out,” he says.\nAre those chemicals and microplastics unsafe?\n---------------------------------------------\nJust about all Americans have measurable amounts of  and  in their bodies. Mammalian animal studies strongly suggest that, once inside, these chemicals act like . They’re not welcome at the party, but they’re also tough to parse from the legitimate guests.\nThat’s because bisphenols and phthalates are .

Unfortunately, a significant portion of these plastics ends up in the environment, where they pose a significant threat to both human health and the ecosystem. According to the study of Peng et al. (2020), there were approximately 15–51 trillion pieces of plastic in the ocean alone in 2015, which corresponded to a total weight of 93,000–236,000 tons. In 2017, this estimate was revised to >8 million tons of plastic entering the ocean each year (Peng et al., 2020). If no recycling actions are taken, plastic use is expected to increase by a further 28 % by 2030 (Fath, 2023).\nMicroplastics (MPs) are defined as small plastic particles <5 mm in diameter (Rhodes, 2018). MPs can be divided into primary MPs and secondary MPs according to the way they are produced. Specifically, primary MPs are mainly the products of intentional industrial production, including small plastic particles known as “microbeads”, which are mainly used in personal care products such as shower gel, toothpaste, and cosmetics (Fath, 2023). After large plastic waste is released into the environment and exposed to mechanical abrasion, water, wind and sunlight, the plastic debris degrades and breaks into smaller particles, known as secondary MPs (Alimi et al., 2021; Gupta et al., 2021). Numerous studies have demonstrated that MPs exist in different...[Content truncated]",

Various types of food-packaging materials are utilized, with plastic being the most versatile. However, there are certain concerns with regards to the usage of plastic packaging because of unreacted monomers’ potential migration from the polymer packaging to the food. The magnitude of monomer migration depends on numerous aspects, including the monomer chemistry, type of plastic packaging, physical–chemical parameters such as the temperature and pH, and food chemistry. The major concern for the presence of packaging monomers in food is that some monomers are endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) with a capability to interfere with the functioning of vital hormonal systems in the human body. For this reason, different countries have resolved to enforce guidelines and regulations for packaging monomers in food. Additionally, many countries have introduced migration testing procedures and safe limits for packaging monomer migration into food. However, to date, several research studies have reported levels of monomer migration above the set migration limits due to leaching from the food-packaging materials into the food. This raises concerns regarding possible health effects on consumers. This paper provides a critical review on plastic food-contact materials’ monomer migration, including that from biodegradable plastic packaging, the monomer migration mechanisms, the monomer migration chemistry, the key factors that affect the migration process, and the associated potential EDC human health risks linked to monomers’ presence in food. The aim is to contribute to the existing knowledge and understanding of plastic food-packaging monomer migration.\n**Keywords:** food-packaging material (FPM), monomer migration, endocrine...[Content truncated]",

Effects of microplastic sizes on leaching are governed by Sherwood number, thickness of aqueous boundary layer and desorption half-life. This review contributes to better understanding of leaching of chemicals from microplastics which affect their ecotoxicities and human toxicity.\n**Keywords:** Abiotic; Additives; Biotic; Leaching; Mechanisms; Partitioning.\nCopyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

As a new dad and a PhD student studying environmental nanotechnology, plastic was on his mind. The year before, scientists had  that plastic baby bottles shed millions of particles into formula, which infants end up swallowing (while also sucking on plastic bottle nipples). “At that time,” Hussain says, “I was purchasing many baby foods, and I was seeing that, even in baby foods, there are a lot of plastics.”\nHussain wanted to know how much was being released from the kinds of containers he’d been buying. So he went to the grocery store, picked up some baby food, and brought the empty containers back to his lab at the University of Nebraska—Lincoln. In a study published in June in , Hussain and his colleagues reported that, when microwaved, these containers released millions of bits of plastic, called microplastics, and even tinier nanoplastics.\nPlastics are complex cocktails of long chains of carbon, called polymers, mixed in with chemical additives, small molecules that help mold the polymers into their final shape and imbue them with resistance to oxidation, UV exposure, and other wear and tear.

In 2019  calculated we might be ingesting about 50,000 microplastic particles per year.\nThe health impacts of eating plastic is still unclear, but researchers have long suspected they’re not great. And  suggests high exposure to microplastics (and the lengthy list of chemicals they’re made from) could provoke immune and stress responses, along with various reproductive, metabolic, and behavioral issues.\nGiven the mounting concern around one of , Hussain’s findings beg a timely question: Can you put plastic in the microwave?\nWhat does microwaving do to plastic?\n------------------------------------\nPlastics are spaghetti-like chains of carbon molecules, called polymers, which are usually derived from crude oil. To make plastics that are clear, cloudy, rigid, or soft, manufacturers add a cocktail of chemicals. Though there are , the most well-studied groups are:  (which include  and are often found in rigid products, like food storage containers and water pipes) and  (which are typically used to make , such as food prep gloves or the plastic lining inside a milk carton).\nAs Hussain found, microplastics and chemicals can build up in your leftovers over time—even when you’re storing those plastic containers in the fridge. But microwaving wet foods in plastic delivers : Heat speeds up hydrolysis, the process by which water molecules can essentially break chemical bonds apart. This supercharged reaction causes plastic containers to shed microplastics and nanoplastics, as well as leach chemical additives (the bisphenols, phthalates, and more), into your food. And once those microplastics are ingested, it’s possible they can degrade and also .\n]\nIn other words, heating plastic essentially makes it softer and more porous. If you’ve ever microwaved marinara sauce in a plastic bowl, you’ve seen the sunset red, impossible-to-remove stain it leaves behind. “Passages in the plastic can open up, so the sauce gets inside,” says James Rogers, PhD the director of food safety research and testing at . The opposite exchange happens too: “If something goes in, something can also come out,” he says.\nAre those chemicals and microplastics unsafe?\n---------------------------------------------\nJust about all Americans have measurable amounts of  and  in their bodies. Mammalian animal studies strongly suggest that, once inside, these chemicals act like . They’re not welcome at the party, but they’re also tough to parse from the legitimate guests.\nThat’s because bisphenols and phthalates are .

        "Question": "What scientific mechanisms explain how microwaving plastic can release harmful chemicals into food?",
        "Answer": "Microwaving plastic can release harmful chemicals into food through several scientific mechanisms: 1. **Heat-Induced Degradation**: When plastic is exposed to heat, especially in a microwave, it undergoes a process known as hydrolysis. This process involves the breaking of chemical bonds within the polymers that make up the plastic. Microwaving food involves both heat and moisture, which amplifies this effect. As the plastic degrades, the polymers can shed microplastics and nanoplastics into the food, which have been shown to be harmful to human health [Query1_evidence_2]. 2. **Chemical Leaching**: Plastics often contain various additives such as Bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, and other chemicals that help to mold and stabilize the plastic. Microwaving can cause these additives to leach from the plastic into the food. For instance, when microwaving wet foods in plastic, the heat accelerates the leaching process by breaking down the chemical bonds in these additives. Studies indicate that microwaving can lead to the release of millions of bits of plastic as well as these potentially harmful chemicals [Query1_evidence_1][Query2_evidence_1]. 3. **Interaction with Digestive Fluids**: Once ingested, microplastics are exposed to digestive fluids that can further enhance the leaching of chemicals. The combination of enzymes and acids in the digestive tract can facilitate the breakdown of microplastics, allowing chemicals that are soluble in fat to leach into the food being digested, thereby increasing human exposure to these harmful substances [Query2_evidence_1]. Given these mechanisms, there is a significant concern about the health implications of consuming food that has been heated in plastic containers, particularly regarding the potential for chemical exposure linked to various health issues, including hormonal disruptions and potential cancer risks.",
