However, the leaching mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. This review paper aims to comprehensively and critically illustrate the leaching mechanisms in biotic and abiotic environments. It analyzes and synthesizes the factors influencing the leaching processes. It achieves the aims by reviewing >165 relevant scholarly papers published mainly in the past 10 years. According to this review, flame retardants, plasticizers and antioxidants are the three main groups of additives in microplastics with the potentials to disrupt endocrine functions, reproduction, brain development and kidney functions. Upon ingestion, the MPs are exposed to digestive fluids containing enzymes and acids which facilitate their degradation and leaching of chemicals. Fats and oils in the digestive tracts also aid the leaching and transport of these chemicals particularly the fat-soluble ones. Leaching is highly variable depending on chemical properties and bisphenols leach to a larger extent than other endocrine disrupting chemicals. However, the rates of leaching remain poorly understood, owing probably to multiple factors at play. Diffusion and partitioning are two main mechanisms of leaching in biotic and abiotic environments. Photodegradation is more predominant in the latter, generating reactive oxygen species which cause microplastic aging and leaching with minimal destruction of the chemicals leached. Effects of microplastic sizes on leaching are governed by Sherwood number, thickness of aqueous boundary layer and desorption half-life. This review contributes to better understanding of leaching of chemicals from microplastics which affect their ecotoxicities and human toxicity.\n**Keywords:** Abiotic; Additives; Biotic; Leaching; Mechanisms; Partitioning.\nCopyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Unfortunately, a significant portion of these plastics ends up in the environment, where they pose a significant threat to both human health and the ecosystem. According to the study of Peng et al. (2020), there were approximately 15–51 trillion pieces of plastic in the ocean alone in 2015, which corresponded to a total weight of 93,000–236,000 tons. In 2017, this estimate was revised to >8 million tons of plastic entering the ocean each year (Peng et al., 2020). If no recycling actions are taken, plastic use is expected to increase by a further 28 % by 2030 (Fath, 2023).\nMicroplastics (MPs) are defined as small plastic particles <5 mm in diameter (Rhodes, 2018). MPs can be divided into primary MPs and secondary MPs according to the way they are produced. Specifically, primary MPs are mainly the products of intentional industrial production, including small plastic particles known as “microbeads”, which are mainly used in personal care products such as shower gel, toothpaste, and cosmetics (Fath, 2023). After large plastic waste is released into the environment and exposed to mechanical abrasion, water, wind and sunlight, the plastic debris degrades and breaks into smaller particles, known as secondary MPs (Alimi et al., 2021; Gupta et al., 2021). Numerous studies have demonstrated that MPs exist in different...[Content truncated]",

Our study aimed at analyzing surface interactions and leachate production of six microplastics under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Leachate production was analyzed for the dissolved organic content (DOC), UV254, and fluorescence through excitation emission (EEM) to determine the kinetics and mechanisms involved in the release of organic matter by UV irradiation. The results suggested there was a clear trend of organic matter being released from the surface of the six microplastics caused by UV irradiation based on DOC, UV254 absorbance, and EEM intensity increasing with time. Polystyrene had the greatest and fastest increase in DOC concentrations, followed by the resin coated polystyrene. Experiments conducted at different temperatures indicated the endothermic nature of these leaching mechanisms. The differences in leachate formation for different ",

These can be used to assist the molding of plastics and can contribute to providing optimal performance to the material when molded and used, or, simply, to reduce costs. However, these additives, and non-polymerized monomers, far more hazardous than their poly-counterparts, may be released throughout the entire life cycle of plastics, posing risks to the environment and, ultimately, human health. Hence, many studies have delved into the mechanistic uptake/release of these compounds. Herein, we briefly overview the current knowledge on the underlying processes affecting these mechanisms.

However, the implications of microplastics are not yet thoroughly understood. There is considerable complexity involved to understand their impact due to different physical–chemical properties that make microplastics multifaceted stressors. If, on the one hand, microplastics carry toxic chemicals in the ecosystems, thus serving as vectors of transport, they are themselves, on the other hand, a cocktail of hazardous chemicals that are added voluntarily during their production as additives to increase polymer properties and prolong their life. To date, there is a considerable lack of knowledge on the major additives of concern that are used in the plastic industry, on their fate once microplastics dispose into the environment, and on their consequent effects on human health when associated with micro and nanoplastics. The present study emphasizes the most toxic and dangerous chemical substances that are contained in all plastic products to describe the effects and implications of these hazardous chemicals on human health, providing a detailed overview of studies that have investigated their abundance on microplastics. In the present work, we conducted a capillary review of the literature on micro and nanoplastic exposure pathways and their potential risk to human health to summarize current knowledge with the intention of better focus future research in this area and fill knowledge gaps.\n**Keywords:** microplastics, additives, human health, nanoplastics\n1\\.

Various types of food-packaging materials are utilized, with plastic being the most versatile. However, there are certain concerns with regards to the usage of plastic packaging because of unreacted monomers’ potential migration from the polymer packaging to the food. The magnitude of monomer migration depends on numerous aspects, including the monomer chemistry, type of plastic packaging, physical–chemical parameters such as the temperature and pH, and food chemistry. The major concern for the presence of packaging monomers in food is that some monomers are endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) with a capability to interfere with the functioning of vital hormonal systems in the human body. For this reason, different countries have resolved to enforce guidelines and regulations for packaging monomers in food. Additionally, many countries have introduced migration testing procedures and safe limits for packaging monomer migration into food. However, to date, several research studies have reported levels of monomer migration above the set migration limits due to leaching from the food-packaging materials into the food. This raises concerns regarding possible health effects on consumers. This paper provides a critical review on plastic food-contact materials’ monomer migration, including that from biodegradable plastic packaging, the monomer migration mechanisms, the monomer migration chemistry, the key factors that affect the migration process, and the associated potential EDC human health risks linked to monomers’ presence in food. The aim is to contribute to the existing knowledge and understanding of plastic food-packaging monomer migration.\n**Keywords:** food-packaging material (FPM), monomer migration, endocrine...[Content truncated]",

This category includes polycarbonate (PC), polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), polyarylsulfone (PAS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyamides (PA), and thermoplastic elastomers, all of which are commonly found in the environment. Conversely, thermosets denote plastics that retain their form even when subjected to heat, such as vinyl ester, polyurethane, acrylic resin, silicone, melamine resin, phenolic resins, and phenol-formaldehyde\\\\-\\].\nNumerous international policies have been established to address the improper disposal of plastic waste; however, mismanagement often leads to the release of such waste, causing detrimental effects on the ecosystem\\,\\]. Plastic undergoes degradation via chemical and physical weathering processes, breaking down into smaller fragments known as MPs. These particles come in various sizes, with those measuring < 5 mm categorized as MPs and those smaller than < 1 µm termed nanoplastics\\,\\]. Apart from the degradation of large plastics, MPs can also be produced through anthropogenic activities such as in the manufacturing of clothing, cosmetics, nurdles, industrial processes, and wastewater treatment\\\\].\nMPs pose a significant challenge to marine ecosystems globally\\\\]. Their impact extends beyond the marine environment, as they are increasingly recognized as pollutants across various environmental compartments\\\\]. Due to their ubiquitous nature and bioavailability, MPs are found extensively in terrestrial environments, marine ecosystems, and plant tissues\\,,,\\]. This widespread presence potentially amplifies the concentration of contaminants in the environment and burdens biological organisms that inadvertently consume microplastic particles\\\\]. The interaction between toxic pollutants and MPs presents a considerable environmental concern, impacting the ecosystem and its biota\\,\\]. Various toxic chemicals, such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), also known as hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs), include organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as well as heavy metals such as lead, copper, zinc, silver, manganese, iron, and aluminum. These contaminants attach to the pitted surfaces of floating MPs in water, facilitated by their wide distribution in water.\nBesides contaminants that adsorb onto MPs, additives are another agent that intensifies their ecotoxicity. Approximately 7% of additive compounds are used during the plastic manufacturing...[Content truncated]",

However, humans and wildlife will only be exposed to plastic chemicals that are released under realistic conditions. Thus, we investigated the toxicological and chemical profiles leaching into water from 24 everyday plastic products covering eight polymer types. We performed migration experiments over 10 days at 40 °C and analyzed the migrates using four in vitro bioassays and nontarget high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MSE). All migrates induced baseline toxicity, 22 an oxidative stress response, 13 antiandrogenicity, and one estrogenicity. Overall, between 17 and 8681 relevant chemical features were present in the migrates. In other words, between 1 and 88% of the plastic chemicals associated with one product were migrating. Further, we tentatively identified ∼8% of all detected features implying that most plastic chemicals remain unknown. While low-density polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, and polyurethane i",
