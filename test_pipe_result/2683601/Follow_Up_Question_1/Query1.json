As a new dad and a PhD student studying environmental nanotechnology, plastic was on his mind. The year before, scientists had  that plastic baby bottles shed millions of particles into formula, which infants end up swallowing (while also sucking on plastic bottle nipples). “At that time,” Hussain says, “I was purchasing many baby foods, and I was seeing that, even in baby foods, there are a lot of plastics.”\nHussain wanted to know how much was being released from the kinds of containers he’d been buying. So he went to the grocery store, picked up some baby food, and brought the empty containers back to his lab at the University of Nebraska—Lincoln. In a study published in June in , Hussain and his colleagues reported that, when microwaved, these containers released millions of bits of plastic, called microplastics, and even tinier nanoplastics.\nPlastics are complex cocktails of long chains of carbon, called polymers, mixed in with chemical additives, small molecules that help mold the polymers into their final shape and imbue them with resistance to oxidation, UV exposure, and other wear and tear.

Children and infants are at a greater risk to develop harmful health effects, though, and the FDA banned the use of BPA in baby bottles in 2012 and baby formula packaging in 2013.\nIt’s unclear what level of exposure to plastics’ endocrine-disrupting chemicals can lead to negative health outcomes. Most studies investigating plastic chemical exposure have looked at the effects on fetuses and animals, says Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor, a toxicologist and medical director at the National Capital Poison Center. The effects of plastic chemical exposure on human adults are still not well-understood.\nThis is because it’s difficult to study how exposure to microplastics and plastic chemical leaching affects adult human health. The best studies would require a control group that hasn’t been exposed, Dr. Johnson-Arbor explains.\n“In the U.S., we are all exposed to plastics,” she says, “You’d have to use a control group from … somewhere they don’t have any plastic. And that’s going to be hard.” Likewise, since plastics are a fairly recent phenomenon, having been popularized in the mid-20th century, it has proven difficult to study their long-term health effects.\nAs scientists work to understand how plastic exposure impacts health, Dr. Sheela Sathyanarayana, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington who studies exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, recommends taking reasonable precautions to limit unnecessary exposure. \nHeat is a key factor that increases the risk of exposure to harmful chemicals in plastic, she explains. “There have been several experiments that heating liquids or foods in plastics that contain these chemicals will certainly increase your exposure to them. And so that’s why we don’t recommend putting plastics in the microwave,” says Sathyanarayana.\nAnd microwaves aren’t the only kitchen appliance to keep your plastic containers away from. “We don’t recommend putting them in the dishwasher because it makes them degrade,” she says.\n“Even if a plastic container is labeled microwave safe, it simply means that it won’t melt,” explains Johnson-Arbor. It can still contain chemicals like BPA, phthalates or other potentially harmful materials unless it specifically says those aren’t included.\nTaking a look at the recycling number on your plastic can give a helpful hint (but not necessarily a definitive one). Plastic No. 3 likely contains DEHP, a phthalate, while plastic No. 7 may contain BPA. No. 6 contains styrene, a possible carcin...[Content truncated]",

It's in bowls, wraps, and a host of bottles and bags used to store foods and beverages. But in recent years more people have been asking whether exposing our food (and ourselves) to all of this plastic is safe.\nStudies have found that certain chemicals in plastic can leach out of the plastic and into the food and beverages we eat. Some of these chemicals have been linked to health problems such as metabolic disorders (including obesity) and reduced fertility. This leaching can occur even faster and to a greater degree when plastic is exposed to heat. This means you might be getting an even higher dose of potentially harmful chemicals simply by microwaving your leftovers in a plastic container.\nTo continue reading this article, you must ****.\nSubscribe to Harvard Health Online for immediate access to health news and information from Harvard Medical School.\n*   Research health conditions\n*   Check your symptoms\n*   Prepare for a doctor's visit or test\n*   Find the best treatments and procedures for you\n*   Explore options for better nutrition and exercise\nI'd like to receive access to Harvard Health Online for only $4.99 a month.\nAlready a member? ****.\nShare This Page   \nPrint This Page Click to Print\nDisclaimer:\n-----------\nAs a service to our readers, Harvard Health Publishing provides access to our library of archived content.

However, it's well-accepted that your lifestyle affects your chances of developing cancer. From your diet and exercise routines to protecting yourself from the sun and avoiding risky behaviors,  can make a difference in your risk of developing many types of cancer.\nHowever, many claims about what causes cancer may cause you to worry unnecessarily about your health and the health of your family.\nBefore you panic, take a look at the facts behind these :\n**Myth: Antiperspirants or deodorants can cause breast cancer.  \nFact:** No conclusive evidence links the use of underarm antiperspirants or deodorants with breast cancer. Some reports have suggested that these products contain harmful substances such as aluminum compounds and parabens that can be absorbed through the skin or enter the body through nicks caused by shaving, but the evidence to date suggests these products don't cause cancer.\n**Myth: Microwaving food in plastic containers and wraps releases harmful, cancer-causing substances.  \nFact:** Plastic containers and wraps labeled as safe for use in the microwave don't pose a threat. You should avoid microwaving plastic containers that were never intended for the microwave, though, such as margarine tubs, takeout containers or whipped topping bowls. Evidence suggests that plastic containers that aren't intended for use in the microwave could melt and potentially leak chemicals into your food.\n**Myth: People who have cancer shouldn't eat sugar, since it can cause cancer to grow faster.  \nFact:** More research is needed to understand the relationship between sugar in the diet and cancer. All kinds of cells, including cancer cells, depend on blood sugar for energy. But giving more sugar to cancer cells doesn't make them grow faster. Likewise, depriving cancer cells of sugar doesn't make them grow more slowly.\nEvidence suggests that consuming large amounts of sugar is associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, though, including cancer of the uterus, cervix, endometrium, ovary, breast, colon, rectum, esophagus, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, kidney and prostate.\n**Myth: Cancer is contagious.  \nFact...[Content truncated]",

In 2019  calculated we might be ingesting about 50,000 microplastic particles per year.\nThe health impacts of eating plastic is still unclear, but researchers have long suspected they’re not great. And  suggests high exposure to microplastics (and the lengthy list of chemicals they’re made from) could provoke immune and stress responses, along with various reproductive, metabolic, and behavioral issues.\nGiven the mounting concern around one of , Hussain’s findings beg a timely question: Can you put plastic in the microwave?\nWhat does microwaving do to plastic?\n------------------------------------\nPlastics are spaghetti-like chains of carbon molecules, called polymers, which are usually derived from crude oil. To make plastics that are clear, cloudy, rigid, or soft, manufacturers add a cocktail of chemicals. Though there are , the most well-studied groups are:  (which include  and are often found in rigid products, like food storage containers and water pipes) and  (which are typically used to make , such as food prep gloves or the plastic lining inside a milk carton).\nAs Hussain found, microplastics and chemicals can build up in your leftovers over time—even when you’re storing those plastic containers in the fridge. But microwaving wet foods in plastic delivers : Heat speeds up hydrolysis, the process by which water molecules can essentially break chemical bonds apart. This supercharged reaction causes plastic containers to shed microplastics and nanoplastics, as well as leach chemical additives (the bisphenols, phthalates, and more), into your food. And once those microplastics are ingested, it’s possible they can degrade and also .\n]\nIn other words, heating plastic essentially makes it softer and more porous. If you’ve ever microwaved marinara sauce in a plastic bowl, you’ve seen the sunset red, impossible-to-remove stain it leaves behind. “Passages in the plastic can open up, so the sauce gets inside,” says James Rogers, PhD the director of food safety research and testing at . The opposite exchange happens too: “If something goes in, something can also come out,” he says.\nAre those chemicals and microplastics unsafe?\n---------------------------------------------\nJust about all Americans have measurable amounts of  and  in their bodies. Mammalian animal studies strongly suggest that, once inside, these chemicals act like . They’re not welcome at the party, but they’re also tough to parse from the legitimate guests.\nThat’s because bisphenols and phthalates are . They can mimic, block, or interfere with the...[Content truncated]",
