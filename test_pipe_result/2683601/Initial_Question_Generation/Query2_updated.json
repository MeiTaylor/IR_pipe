The term plastic refers to a range of materials, with substances added to shape or stabilize it. The two most common stabilizers are:\n*   **Bisphenol A (BPA):** Used to make plastic harder\n*   **Phthalates:** Used to make plastic stronger and more flexible\nThese substances matter because BPA, and some phthalates, are considered endocrine disruptors, which mimic or block natural hormones in the body.  \n\u201cIt\u2019s important to avoid substances that interfere with hormones,\u201d says , a board-certified  and  doctor with . \u201cThese substances can lead to infertility; thyroid disease; early puberty; leukemia; breast, uterine and prostate cancers; neurobehavioral issues; obesity; and metabolic dysfunction.\u201d\nThe study found that phthalates may contribute to over 100,000 premature deaths a year.\u00a0People with the highest levels of phthalates had a greater risk of death from any cause, especially cardiovascular mortality.  \nSo is it time to toss your plastic storage collection? Not necessarily. While all the above sounds a bit scary, consider the following:\n1.  **The FDA regulates plastic.** The FDA makes certain determinations when it comes to plastic, such as how much of a chemical you can consume during your lifetime with little to no risk. While this doesn\u2019t necessarily prevent some substances from being included in plastic, it ensures the amounts are within an estimated safe range.\n2.  **There are good plastics and bad plastics.** Some plastic materials are safer than others. You\u2019ll want to avoid BPA entirely, and check the recycling symbol marked on the bottom. In general, avoid plastics with the numbers 1, 3, 6 or 7 on them. Safer options will be labeled 2, 4 and 5.\n3.  **It\u2019s a bad idea to heat food in plastic.** According to the World Health Organization (WHO), microwaving food is generally safe. However, microwaving in plastic containers is associated with increased leaching \u2014 the transfer or leaking of chemicals into food. Note that even if a plastic container is labeled \u201cmicrowave safe,\u201d that simply means it won\u2019t melt.\n**Store safe, heat safe, eat safe**  \nTo keep your food safe, whether you\u2019re heating it or not, consider these general rules:\n1.  Choose phthalate-free and BPA-free products.\n2.  In the microwave, heat food in...[Content truncated]",

They\u2019re too convenient not to keep, and perhaps the thought of throwing away volumes of plastic day after day makes you cringe, so they go into the cupboard for reuse. \nBut are these plastic takeout containers safe? What about plastic Tupperware or plastic plates and bowls? Are these an easy reusable option, or a serious health risk? It\u2019s an interesting question with an unclear answer, so let\u2019s take a look.\nPlastic containers \u2014 from food packaging to coffee cups \u2014 contain materials that can mess with human hormones like estrogens and testosterone. These are called endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and unfortunately they can end up in your food.\nThere are two main ways that can happen. First, over time plastic wears down and loses tiny parts of its structure \u2014 little \u201cmicroplastics\u201d that can then get mixed in with your meal. Second, endocrine-disrupting chemicals can leak (or, more formally, \u201cleach\u201c) from plastics and soak directly into your food. Microwaving plastic only makes matters worse; both the shedding of microplastics and the leaching of chemicals become more likely when plastic is heated.\nSome of the key endocrine-disrupting chemicals in modern plastics are Bisphenol A, better known as BPA, and a class of chemicals known as phthalates. Both chemicals help to make plastics more durable and sturdy, but they can also interfere with the body\u2019s hormonal communications. BPA in particular is known to mimic the functions of estrogen. As a result, consuming phthalates is...[Content truncated]",

As a new dad and a PhD student studying environmental nanotechnology, plastic was on his mind. The year before, scientists had  that plastic baby bottles shed millions of particles into formula, which infants end up swallowing (while also sucking on plastic bottle nipples). \u201cAt that time,\u201d Hussain says, \u201cI was purchasing many baby foods, and I was seeing that, even in baby foods, there are a lot of plastics.\u201d\nHussain wanted to know how much was being released from the kinds of containers he\u2019d been buying. So he went to the grocery store, picked up some baby food, and brought the empty containers back to his lab at the University of Nebraska\u2014Lincoln. In a study published in June in , Hussain and his colleagues reported that, when microwaved, these containers released millions of bits of plastic, called microplastics, and even tinier nanoplastics.\nPlastics are complex cocktails of long chains of carbon, called polymers, mixed in with chemical additives, small molecules that help mold the polymers into their final shape and imbue them with resistance to oxidation, UV exposure, and other wear and tear.

Despite such warnings, many foods in our supermarkets are packaged in a variety of plastic containers often labeled as microwave safe. We wondered whether this practice was truly warranted, and if, indeed, there was scientific evidence that potentially harmful substances were transferred from plastic containers into food during heating in the microwave oven.\nBefore reviewing the literature and the internet posts concerning migration of plastic components into food, we needed to understand basic information about the plastics themselves as well as what components might be transferred into food. Plastic is a generic term; there is no single component of plastic in terms of chemical composition. The term describes a family of polymer substances ranging from polyvinyl chloride (the compound in white PVC plumbing pipes) to one of the original synthetic plastic compounds, Bakelite, once used to make tableware. Plastics can be composed of organic polymers and organic or inorganic additives compounded in a variety of forms. Most plastics are made from petrochemicals. The toxicity of the various plastic compounds depends on what is in the specific plastic and how stable it is under a variety of conditions, for example, heating in a microwave oven. Because most plastics are insoluble in water, they are almost always quite stable and chemically inert.\nTwo additives in various plastics, however, have concerned toxicologists for many years as potential human health hazards: bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates.\n00523-X/fulltext#)\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.

Today: Can you put plastic in the microwave?_\nIt all started by accident. Kazi Albab Hussain, a PhD student at the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln, was studying  released by certain types of plastic food packaging when he noticed another confetti-like substance under the microscope: tiny plastic bits.\nAs a new father he became preoccupied by the discovery. \u201cI\u2019d been exposed to a whole new world, and I was worried to see that a lot of baby foods were stored in plastic,\u201d he says. So Hussain shifted gears in his research. He wanted to know: Just how many of these particles was his child eating?\nQuite possibly billions, according to his . To test materials widely used in baby food packaging, Hussain brought a couple of store-bought polypropylene-based reusable plastic containers and a polyethylene-based reusable plastic food pouch back to his lab. Along with his team, he filled the storage vessels with water and 3% acetic acid to mimic the aqueous and acidic foods they might reasonably contain in real life. After storing the filled containers in the fridge or at room temperature for 10 days, the team found millions to billions of microplastics and nanoplastics in the liquids.\n the containers accelerated the process by an alarming magnitude: Within three minutes, some containers released as many as 4.22 million  (particles smaller than 5 millimeters) and 2.11 billion nanoplastics (particles about 70 times smaller than the width of a human hair) per square centimeter of surface area. Hussain\u2019s research indicates we\u2019re eating a lot more plastic than previously believed. In 2019  calculated we might be ingesting about 50,000 microplastic particles per year.\nThe health impacts of eating plastic is still unclear, but researchers have long suspected they\u2019re not great. And  suggests high exposure to microplastics (and the lengthy list of chemicals they\u2019re made from) could provoke immune and stress responses, along with various reproductive, metabolic, and behavioral issues.\nGiven the mounting concern around one of , Hussain\u2019s findings beg a timely question: Can you put plastic in the microwave?\nWhat does microwaving do to plastic?\n------------------------------------\nPlastics are spaghetti-like chains of carbon molecules, called polymers, which are usually derived from crude oil.

So, doing things like drinking from plastic bottles or using plastic containers and food bags won\u2019t increase your risk of cancer. Some people think that chemicals that can be found in plastics, like bisphenol A (BPA) can get into our food or drink and then cause cancer. Even though some studies have found certain chemicals in plastics can end up in things we may eat and drink, the levels are low, and within a range considered safe to humans. This is even in experiments when plastics are heated for hours at a time.\nOther studies on human cells or in animals have suggested some chemicals that can be found in plastics have cancer-causing effects. But these experiments are very different from how people actually come into contact with plastics in their everyday life. So, they don\u2019t give good evidence on cancer risk in humans. For example, studies often put lots of a chemical directly on to one type of cell, which doesn\u2019t happen in the human body.\nSources:\nUpvote \u00b7\n]\nStudied at University of New South Wales \u00b7 Author has 1.3K answers and 13.1M answer views\n\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0\nRelated\nDoes eating microwaved foods cause cancer?\n!\nIf you...[Content truncated]",

But despite that knowledge, we sometimes fall into the trap of heating up our lunch packed Tupperware containers for the sake of time and convenience.\nIf you do a deep dive into the dangers of plastics in the kitchen, you would probably quit this bad habit cold turkey, but the truth is we\u2019re all strapped for time and are just looking for a safe way to heat our leftovers in the microwave in less than two minutes.\nThat\u2019s why we rounded up some quick guidance on how to microwave safely in a plastic world.\nWhat\u2019s the Problem with Plastic, Anyway?\n----------------------------------------\nThe two key culprits to dangerous plastics are the man-made chemicals Phthalates and Bisphenol A (BPA), which are often added to plastic to help it keep its shape and pliability. In high volume, these substances have been linked to several negative health outcomes including ,  and . Pregnant people and children may be at greater risk of harmful effects. While these studies are not directly related to microwaving plastics, Phthalates and  are found in various types of food packaging, beauty products and other environmental exposure.

Therefore, you should avoid microwaving plastic, unless it\u2019s labeled for this specific use. \nWhile microwaving plastic accelerates the release of BPA and phthalates, it\u2019s not the only way these chemicals can end up in your food or drinks.\nOther factors that can increase chemical leaching include (14, 17):\nAs a general rule, plastic containers that are cracked, pitting, or show signs of wear, should be replaced with new BPA-free plastic containers or containers made from glass.\nToday, many food storage containers are made from BPA-free PP. \nYou can identify containers made from PP by looking on the bottom for the PP stamp or a recycling sign with the number 5 in the middle.\nPlastic food packaging like clingy plastic wrap can also contain BPA and phthalates (18).\nAs such, if you need to cover your food in the microwave, use wax paper, parchment paper, or a paper towel. \nPlastic containers that are scratched, damaged, or excessively worn, pose a higher risk of chemical leaching. \nPlastics are materials made primarily from oil or petroleum, and they have a variety of applications.\nWhile many food storage, preparation, and serving products are made from plastic, microwaving them can accelerate the release of harmful chemicals like BPA and phthalates.\nTherefore, unless the plastic product is deemed microwave safe, avoid microwaving it, and replace worn plastic containers with new ones. \nShare this article\nFrom on-the-go coffee...[Content truncated]",

It will not leach endocrine-disrupting chemicals into the food cooked therein. The microwaves themselves are utterly harmless (unless you have a pacemaker, but you\u2019re only 19 so I doubt that would be the case). All plastic containers for frozen food intended to be microwaved are safe.\nSome plastics have phthalates or BPA which might leach into your food\u2014if nuked at high temperatures for longer than it takes to thaw or reheat. So if you\u2019re worried, dump the food onto a paper plate before nuking it. Those chemicals are thought to be \u201cendocrine disruptors,\u201d which might cause your glands to make excess sex hormones (testosterone for men, estrogen for women), accelerate puberty; and (decades down the line way past midlife, and only maybe) raise the baseline risk (the risk everyone already has) of breast or prostate cancer\u2014provided you ingest them every single day for the rest of your life.\nBon appetit. Enjoy being 19!\nWell, one thing that will happen is your plastic bowl will break down and the structure will be disrupted and particles of plastic will get in your food.\nThen after so much time you will have to get another bowl and you will be out $ 5.00.

Many people are especially concerned about microwaving at high temperatures or heating fatty or oily foods like cheese and meat. But plastic containers that release anything more than a very small amount of plasticizers are not approved for use in Canada.\nHow to safely store and reheat food\n-----------------------------------\n*   Use glass, ceramic and plastic containers and plastic wrap that are labelled as microwave safe. Always follow the instructions on the label when you use microwave-safe containers to heat food.\n*   Never heat or store food in plastic containers that were not intended for food. Single-use containers, like margarine tubs, tend to warp or melt in the microwave. This may allow more of the substances in the plastic to leach into the food.\n*   Let food cool before adding it to a plastic container, then put it in the fridge immediately. Avoid plastics that are visibly damaged or stained or have a bad smell.\nThe Canadian Cancer Society is committed to sharing important information about cancer risk to Canadians and will continue to monitor research in this area.\nOur enewsletter\nEnter your email to receive occasional news and important updates!\nYour email address \n{{ error }}\nSubscribe\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*...[Content truncated]",
