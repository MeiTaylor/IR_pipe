But these experiments involve human cells in a lab, or animals. These are very different from how people would come into contact with plastics in their everyday life.

All of these can cause a container to crack and shed tiny bits of itself as microplastics, nanoplastics, and , toxic chemical components of the plastic.\nThe human health effects of plastic exposure are unclear, but scientists have  that they aren’t good. First, these particles are sneaky. Once they enter the body they coat themselves with proteins, slipping past the immune system incognito, “like Trojan horses,” says Trinity College Dublin chemistry professor John Boland, who was not involved in this study.

What about plastic Tupperware or plastic plates and bowls? Are these an easy reusable option, or a serious health risk? It’s an interesting question with an unclear answer, so let’s take a look.\nPlastic containers — from food packaging to coffee cups — contain materials that can mess with human hormones like estrogens and testosterone. These are called endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and unfortunately they can end up in your food.\nThere are two main ways that can happen. First, over time plastic wears down and loses tiny parts of its structure — little “microplastics” that can then get mixed in with your meal. Second, endocrine-disrupting chemicals can leak (or, more formally, “leach“) from plastics and soak directly into your food. Microwaving plastic only makes matters worse; both the shedding of microplastics and the leaching of chemicals become more likely when plastic is heated.\nSome of the key endocrine-disrupting chemicals in modern plastics are Bisphenol A, better known as BPA, and a class of chemicals known as phthalates. Both chemicals help to make plastics more durable and sturdy, but they can also interfere with the body’s hormonal communications. BPA in particular is known to mimic the functions of estrogen. As a result, consuming phthalates is...[Content truncated]",

Today: Can you put plastic in the microwave?_\nIt all started by accident. Kazi Albab Hussain, a PhD student at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, was studying  released by certain types of plastic food packaging when he noticed another confetti-like substance under the microscope: tiny plastic bits.\nAs a new father he became preoccupied by the discovery. “I’d been exposed to a whole new world, and I was worried to see that a lot of baby foods were stored in plastic,” he says. So Hussain shifted gears in his research. He wanted to know: Just how many of these particles was his child eating?\nQuite possibly billions, according to his . To test materials widely used in baby food packaging, Hussain brought a couple of store-bought polypropylene-based reusable plastic containers and a polyethylene-based reusable plastic food pouch back to his lab. Along with his team, he filled the storage vessels with water and 3% acetic acid to mimic the aqueous and acidic foods they might reasonably contain in real life. After storing the filled containers in the fridge or at room temperature for 10 days, the team found millions to billions of microplastics and nanoplastics in the liquids.\n the containers accelerated the process by an alarming magnitude: Within three minutes, some containers released as many as 4.22 million  (particles smaller than 5 millimeters) and 2.11 billion nanoplastics (particles about 70 times smaller than the width of a human hair) per square centimeter of surface area. Hussain’s research indicates we’re eating a lot more plastic than previously believed. In 2019  calculated we might be ingesting about 50,000 microplastic particles per year.\nThe health impacts of eating plastic is still unclear, but researchers have long suspected they’re not great. And  suggests high exposure to microplastics (and the lengthy list of chemicals they’re made from) could provoke immune and stress responses, along with various reproductive, metabolic, and behavioral issues.\nGiven the mounting concern around one of , Hussain’s findings beg a timely question: Can you put plastic in the microwave?\nWhat does microwaving do to plastic?\n------------------------------------\nPlastics are spaghetti-like chains of carbon molecules, called polymers, which are usually derived from crude oil.

First, over time plastic wears down and loses tiny parts of its structure — little “microplastics” that can then get mixed in with your meal. Second, endocrine-disrupting chemicals can leak (or, more formally, “leach“) from plastics and soak directly into your food. Microwaving plastic only makes matters worse; both the shedding of microplastics and the leaching of chemicals become more likely when plastic is heated.\nSome of the key endocrine-disrupting chemicals in modern plastics are Bisphenol A, better known as BPA, and a class of chemicals known as phthalates. Both chemicals help to make plastics more durable and sturdy, but they can also interfere with the body’s hormonal communications. BPA in particular is known to mimic the functions of estrogen. As a result, consuming phthalates is...[Content truncated]"

As a new dad and a PhD student studying environmental nanotechnology, plastic was on his mind. The year before, scientists had  that plastic baby bottles shed millions of particles into formula, which infants end up swallowing (while also sucking on plastic bottle nipples). “At that time,” Hussain says, “I was purchasing many baby foods, and I was seeing that, even in baby foods, there are a lot of plastics.”\nHussain wanted to know how much was being released from the kinds of containers he’d been buying. So he went to the grocery store, picked up some baby food, and brought the empty containers back to his lab at the University of Nebraska—Lincoln. In a study published in June in , Hussain and his colleagues reported that, when microwaved, these containers released millions of bits of plastic, called microplastics, and even tinier nanoplastics.\nPlastics are complex cocktails of long chains of carbon, called polymers, mixed in with chemical additives, small molecules that help mold the polymers into their final shape and imbue them with resistance to oxidation, UV exposure, and other wear and tear.

But the levels are very low, and within a range considered safe to humans. This is even true in experiments where plastics are heated for hours at a time.\nOther studies have suggested some chemicals found in certain plastics have cancer-causing effects. But these experiments involve human cells in a lab, or animals. These are very different from how people would come into contact with plastics in their everyday life. And they don’t give good evidence on cancer risk in humans.\nFor example, in these studies, lots of a chemical may be put directly on to one type of cell. This wouldn’t happen in the human body.\nThere are many cancer myths that haven’t been .

        "Question": "What scientific studies support the claim that microwaving food in plastic containers releases cancer-causing agents?",
        "Answer": "The claim that microwaving food in plastic containers releases cancer-causing agents is supported by several studies highlighting the risks associated with certain plastics under heat. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Leaching of Chemicals**: Certain plastics contain endocrine-disrupting chemicals, such as Bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, which can leach into food, especially when heated. Microwaving increases the likelihood of this leaching, which can then result in chemical exposure through consumption. These chemicals have been associated with hormonal disruptions, which could potentially lead to health issues, including cancer.\n\n2. **Microplastic Release**: A study focusing on baby-food containers demonstrated that microwaving these plastic containers leads to the release of millions of tiny plastic particles (microplastics) into foods. These microplastics could pose health risks when ingested, although the direct link to cancer is more complex and still under investigation.\n\n3. **Cancer Risk Assessment**: While some studies have observed that chemicals in plastics may have cancer-causing effects in laboratory settings, most evidence suggests that everyday exposure levels, even with heating, remain within what health agencies deem acceptable. However, the cumulative effect of consistent exposure to these chemicals remains a concern, warranting caution.\n\nWhile there is substantial concern regarding the potential risks linked to heating plastics, definitive evidence directly connecting these actions to cancer development in humans is still evolving. Therefore, one should exercise caution when microwaving food in plastic containers due to the potential for harmful chemical leaching and microplastic contamination.",
