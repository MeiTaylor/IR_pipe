Beyond being wrong, many of these myths may cause you to worry unnecessarily about your own health and the health of your family.\nBefore you panic, take a look at the reality behind these common myths.\nMyth: Antiperspirants or deodorants can cause breast cancer.\n------------------------------------------------------------\n**Fact:** There's no conclusive evidence linking the use of underarm antiperspirants or deodorants with breast cancer.\nSome reports have suggested that these products contain harmful substances such as aluminum compounds and parabens that can be absorbed through the skin or enter the body through nicks caused by shaving. No clinical studies have yet given a definitive answer to the question of whether these products cause breast cancer. But the evidence to date suggests these products don't cause cancer.\nIf you're still concerned that your underarm antiperspirant or deodorant could increase your risk of cancer, choose products that don't contain chemicals that worry you.\nMyth: Microwaving food in plastic containers and wraps releases harmful, cancer-causing substances.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Fact:** Plastic containers and wraps labeled as safe for use in the microwave don't pose a threat.\nThere is some evidence that plastic containers that aren't intended for use in the microwave could melt and potentially leak chemicals into your food. Avoid microwaving plastic containers that were never intended for the microwave, such as margarine tubs, takeout containers or whipped topping bowls.\nCheck to see that any container you use in the microwave is labeled as microwave-safe.\nMyth: People who have cancer shouldn't eat sugar, since it can cause cancer to grow faster.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Fact:** More research is needed to understand the relationship between sugar in the diet and cancer. All kinds of cells, including cancer cells, depend on blood sugar (glucose) for energy. But giving more sugar to cancer cells doesn't make them grow faster. Likewise, depriving cancer cells of sugar doesn't make them grow more slowly.\nThis misconception may be based in part on a misunderstanding of positron emission tomography (PET) scans, which use a small amount of radioactive tracer — typically a form of glucose.

Here's what the latest research says about how to safely microwave your food.\nDespite being a kitchen workhorse for decades, few household items have been more divisive than the microwave. It's hailed as a lifesaver for those who can't, or won't, cook, and portrayed by some chefs as singlehandedly dragging the art of cooking into the gutter.\nBut another debate lies beyond the culinary disputes – when is microwave cooking bad for you?\nWhen used correctly, there's nothing to worry about in terms of your microwave's radiation, according to the World Health Organization. But other concerns are less clear – including whether microwaving food causes nutrient loss, or whether heating food in plastic can trigger hormone disruption.\nSome research has shown that vegetables lose some of their nutritional value in the microwave.\nFor example, microwaving has been found to remove 97% of the flavonoids – plant compounds with anti-inflammatory benefits – in broccoli. That's a third more damage than done by boiling. \nBut the conventional oven may be a stronger competitor for the microwave. A 2020 study compared the nutritional levels of a frozen ready meal cooked in the microwave, and the same meal cooked in a conventional oven. The researchers found that the only...[Content truncated]",

This includes drinking from plastic bottles and using plastic containers and bags to store food in.\n**Should I avoid food and drink stored in plastic?**\n----------------------------------------------------\nCutting down on using plastics won’t affect your cancer risk. But it can have environmental benefits.\nIn the UK, the Food Standard Agency makes sure plastics and other materials used for food and drink are safe. \n**Does bisphenol A (BPA) cause cancer?**\n----------------------------------------\nFood and drink that’s stored in plastic with BPA doesn’t cause cancer.\nSome people thought that chemicals that in some plastics, like bisphenol A (BPA) could get into our food or drink and then cause cancer.\nStudies have found that certain chemicals in plastics may end up in things we may eat and drink. But the levels are very low, and within a range considered safe to humans. This is even true in experiments where plastics are heated for hours at a time.\nOther studies have suggested some chemicals found in certain plastics have cancer-causing effects. But these experiments involve human cells in a lab, or animals. These are very different from how people would come into contact with plastics in their everyday life. And they don’t give good evidence on cancer risk in humans.\nFor example, in these studies, lots of a chemical may be put directly on to one type of cell. This wouldn’t happen in the human body.\nThere are many cancer myths that haven’t been . However, there are proven causes of cancer, and things you can do to reduce your risk.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n!\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFood Standards Agency....[Content truncated]",

It's in bowls, wraps, and a host of bottles and bags used to store foods and beverages. But in recent years more people have been asking whether exposing our food (and ourselves) to all of this plastic is safe.\nStudies have found that certain chemicals in plastic can leach out of the plastic and into the food and beverages we eat. Some of these chemicals have been linked to health problems such as metabolic disorders (including obesity) and reduced fertility. This leaching can occur even faster and to a greater degree when plastic is exposed to heat. This means you might be getting an even higher dose of potentially harmful chemicals simply by microwaving your leftovers in a plastic container.\nTo continue reading this article, you must ****.\nSubscribe to Harvard Health Online for immediate access to health news and information from Harvard Medical School.\n*   Research health conditions\n*   Check your symptoms\n*   Prepare for a doctor's visit or test\n*   Find the best treatments and procedures for you\n*   Explore options for better nutrition and exercise\nI'd like to receive access to Harvard Health Online for only $4.99 a month.\nAlready a member? ****.\nShare This Page   \nPrint This Page Click to Print\nDisclaimer:\n-----------\nAs a service to our readers, Harvard Health Publishing provides access to our library of archived content.

As a new dad and a PhD student studying environmental nanotechnology, plastic was on his mind. The year before, scientists had  that plastic baby bottles shed millions of particles into formula, which infants end up swallowing (while also sucking on plastic bottle nipples). “At that time,” Hussain says, “I was purchasing many baby foods, and I was seeing that, even in baby foods, there are a lot of plastics.”\nHussain wanted to know how much was being released from the kinds of containers he’d been buying. So he went to the grocery store, picked up some baby food, and brought the empty containers back to his lab at the University of Nebraska—Lincoln. In a study published in June in , Hussain and his colleagues reported that, when microwaved, these containers released millions of bits of plastic, called microplastics, and even tinier nanoplastics.\nPlastics are complex cocktails of long chains of carbon, called polymers, mixed in with chemical additives, small molecules that help mold the polymers into their final shape and imbue them with resistance to oxidation, UV exposure, and other wear and tear. Microwaving delivers a double whammy: heat and hydrolysis, a chemical reaction through which bonds are broken by water molecules. All of these can cause a container to crack and shed tiny bits of itself as microplastics, nanoplastics, and , toxic chemical components of the plastic.\nThe human health effects of plastic exposure are unclear, but scientists have  that they aren’t good. First, these particles are sneaky. Once they enter the body they coat themselves with proteins, slipping past the immune system incognito, “like Trojan horses,” says Trinity College Dublin chemistry professor John Boland, who was not involved in this study. Microplastics also collect a complex community of microbes, called the , and transport them into the body.\nOur kidneys remove waste, placing them on the front lines of exposure to contaminants. They are OK at filtering out the relatively larger microplastics, so we probably excrete a lot...[Content truncated]",
