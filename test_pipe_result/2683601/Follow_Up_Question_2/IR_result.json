Those guidelines call for mixing powdered formula with water heated to at least 158 degrees Fahrenheit to reduce bacteria loads.\nWhat they found was that the release of microplastics was highly temperature sensitive, Boland said. \"What's happening is that there's an interaction between the [plastic] polymer and the water,\" Boland said. \"It's almost like a flaking of the surface of the actual plastic itself.\" Hotter water exacerbates that flaking, and so does shaking the bottle.\nWhen the researchers filled the plastic baby bottles with room temperature water and shook them for about 60 seconds, to simulate normal formula preparations, \"you get hundreds of thousands of microplastics,\" he said. When they increased that temperature to 158 F, the bottles released anywhere from 1 million to 16 million particles per liter. The bottles also released trillions of even smaller nanoplastics — tiny bits of plastic ranging in size from 10 nanometers up to 1 micron – so many that \"we stopped counting them,\" he said.\nThe plastic bottles continued to release microplastic particles over 21 days of testing. \nThe researchers then used global sales data for plastic baby bottles and information on national breastfeeding rates to estimate the potential exposure to microplastics for infants around the world in the first 12 months of life. Overall, they estimated that the average infant consumes more than 1.5 million microplastics particles per day.\nBut those estimates varied drastically depending on the region of the world. Infants in higher-income parts of the world, including North America and Europe, where breastfeeding rates are lower, could potentially be consuming well over 2 million microplastic particles per day, they estimated. Meanwhile, in China, where glass baby bottles are more popular, the average infant's consumption of microplastics is estimated to be in the \"tens of thousands\" of particles, Boland said.\nInfants and Asia and Africa had the lowest potential exposure, they estimated.\nWhile the health effects of microplastics are still unknown, parents can significantly reduce their infants' exposure by adding some steps to their bottle preparation routine, Boland said. He recommends letting plastic bottles cool completely after sterilization in hot water, then rinsing them out at least three times with water that's been allowed to cool...[Content truncated]",

But other concerns are less clear – including whether microwaving food causes nutrient loss, or whether heating food in plastic can trigger hormone disruption.\nSome research has shown that vegetables lose some of their nutritional value in the microwave.\nFor example, microwaving has been found to remove 97% of the flavonoids – plant compounds with anti-inflammatory benefits – in broccoli. That's a third more damage than done by boiling. \nBut the conventional oven may be a stronger competitor for the microwave.

Today: Can you put plastic in the microwave?_\nIt all started by accident. Kazi Albab Hussain, a PhD student at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, was studying  released by certain types of plastic food packaging when he noticed another confetti-like substance under the microscope: tiny plastic bits.\nAs a new father he became preoccupied by the discovery. “I’d been exposed to a whole new world, and I was worried to see that a lot of baby foods were stored in plastic,” he says. So Hussain shifted gears in his research. He wanted to know: Just how many of these particles was his child eating?\nWatch\nQuite possibly billions, according to his . To test materials widely used in baby food packaging, Hussain brought a couple of store-bought polypropylene-based reusable plastic containers and a polyethylene-based reusable plastic food pouch back to his lab. Along with his team, he filled the storage vessels with water and 3% acetic acid to mimic the aqueous and acidic foods they might reasonably contain in real life. After storing the filled containers in the fridge or at room temperature for 10 days, the team found millions to billions of microplastics and nanoplastics in the liquids.\n the containers accelerated the process by an alarming magnitude: Within three minutes, some containers released as many as 4.22 million  (particles smaller than 5 millimeters) and 2.11 billion nanoplastics (particles about 70 times smaller than the width of a human hair) per square centimeter of surface area. Hussain’s research indicates we’re eating a lot more plastic than previously believed. In 2019  calculated we might be ingesting about 50,000 microplastic particles per year.\nThe health impacts of eating plastic is still unclear, but researchers have long suspected they’re not great. And  suggests high exposure to microplastics (and the lengthy list of chemicals they’re made from) could provoke immune and stress responses, along with various reproductive, metabolic, and behavioral issues.\nGiven the mounting concern around one of , Hussain’s findings beg a timely question: Can you put plastic in the microwave?\nWhat does microwaving do to plastic?\n------------------------------------\nPlastics are spaghetti-like chains of carbon molecules, called polymers, which are usually derived from crude oil.

Today: Can you put plastic in the microwave?_\nIt all started by accident. Kazi Albab Hussain, a PhD student at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, was studying  released by certain types of plastic food packaging when he noticed another confetti-like substance under the microscope: tiny plastic bits.\nAs a new father he became preoccupied by the discovery. “I’d been exposed to a whole new world, and I was worried to see that a lot of baby foods were stored in plastic,” he says. So Hussain shifted gears in his research. He wanted to know: Just how many of these particles was his child eating?\nWatch\nQuite possibly billions, according to his . To test materials widely used in baby food packaging, Hussain brought a couple of store-bought polypropylene-based reusable plastic containers and a polyethylene-based reusable plastic food pouch back to his lab. Along with his team, he filled the storage vessels with water and 3% acetic acid to mimic the aqueous and acidic foods they might reasonably contain in real life. After storing the filled containers in the fridge or at room temperature for 10 days, the team found millions to billions of microplastics and nanoplastics in the liquids.\n the containers accelerated the process by an alarming magnitude: Within three minutes, some containers released as many as 4.22 million  (particles smaller than 5 millimeters) and 2.11 billion nanoplastics (particles about 70 times smaller than the width of a human hair) per square centimeter of surface area. Hussain’s research indicates we’re eating a lot more plastic than previously believed. In 2019  calculated we might be ingesting about 50,000 microplastic particles per year.\nThe health impacts of eating plastic is still unclear, but researchers have long suspected they’re not great. And  suggests high exposure to microplastics (and the lengthy list of chemicals they’re made from) could provoke immune and stress responses, along with various reproductive, metabolic, and behavioral issues.\nGiven the mounting concern around one of , Hussain’s findings beg a timely question: Can you put plastic in the microwave?\nWhat does microwaving do to plastic?\n------------------------------------\nPlastics are spaghetti-like chains of carbon molecules, called polymers, which are usually derived from crude oil. To make plastics that are clear, cloudy, rigid,...[Content truncated]"

As a new dad and a PhD student studying environmental nanotechnology, plastic was on his mind. The year before, scientists had  that plastic baby bottles shed millions of particles into formula, which infants end up swallowing (while also sucking on plastic bottle nipples). “At that time,” Hussain says, “I was purchasing many baby foods, and I was seeing that, even in baby foods, there are a lot of plastics.”\nHussain wanted to know how much was being released from the kinds of containers he’d been buying. So he went to the grocery store, picked up some baby food, and brought the empty containers back to his lab at the University of Nebraska—Lincoln. In a study published in June in , Hussain and his colleagues reported that, when microwaved, these containers released millions of bits of plastic, called microplastics, and even tinier nanoplastics.\nPlastics are complex cocktails of long chains of carbon, called polymers, mixed in with chemical additives, small molecules that help mold the polymers into their final shape and imbue them with resistance to oxidation, UV exposure, and other wear and tear. Microwaving delivers a double whammy: heat and hydrolysis,...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What are the long-term health effects of consistent exposure to heated plastic chemicals from microwaving food?",
        "Answer": "Consistent exposure to heated plastic chemicals from microwaving food may have several long-term health effects, primarily due to the leaching of harmful substances and the ingestion of microplastics. Here are some potential health implications:\n\n1. **Endocrine Disruption**: Many chemicals that leach from heated plastics are known endocrine disruptors. These substances can interfere with hormonal signals in the body, potentially leading to several health issues such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, reproductive problems (including infertility), and developmental disorders in children (e.g., autism and ADHD). Disruption of hormonal regulation can also lead to cancers since hormones play a critical role in cell growth and regulation.\n\n2. **Immune System Effects**: Research suggests that high exposure to microplastics and the chemicals associated with them could provoke immune and stress responses in the body. This could manifest in various health problems, from immune dysfunction to chronic inflammation, which are known to contribute to the development of diseases over time.\n\n3. **Metabolic Issues**: Ingesting microplastics may lead to metabolic problems. Some studies indicate a correlation between microplastic exposure and dysregulated metabolism, which can contribute to weight gain and obesity-related conditions. The cumulative effects of these chemicals could be particularly concerning for vulnerable populations, such as children and pregnant women, who are at greater risk for developmental issues and hormonal imbalances.\n\n4. **Potential for Cancer**: Long-term exposure to certain chemicals released from plastics, such as phthalates and BPA, has been linked to an increased risk of cancers due to their ability to disrupt normal cellular functions and growth. Although definitive causal links in humans are still under study, the presence of these harmful chemicals in the body is a growing concern in cancer epidemiology.\n\nGiven the evidence and potential health risks associated with consistent exposure to heated plastic chemicals, it is prudent to minimize the use of plastic containers in microwaves. The cumulative exposure to microplastics and endocrine-disrupting chemicals poses significant health risks that warrant caution.",
