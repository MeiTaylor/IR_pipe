Despite such warnings, many foods in our supermarkets are packaged in a variety of plastic containers often labeled as microwave safe. We wondered whether this practice was truly warranted, and if, indeed, there was scientific evidence that potentially harmful substances were transferred from plastic containers into food during heating in the microwave oven.\nBefore reviewing the literature and the internet posts concerning migration of plastic components into food, we needed to understand basic information about the plastics themselves as well as what components might be transferred into food. Plastic is a generic term; there is no single component of plastic in terms of chemical composition. The term describes a family of polymer substances ranging from polyvinyl chloride (the compound in white PVC plumbing pipes) to one of the original synthetic plastic compounds, Bakelite, once used to make tableware. Plastics can be composed of organic polymers and organic or inorganic additives compounded in a variety of forms. Most plastics are made from petrochemicals. The toxicity of the various plastic compounds depends on what is in the specific plastic and how stable it is under a variety of conditions, for example, heating in a microwave oven. Because most plastics are insoluble in water, they are almost always quite stable and chemically inert.\nTwo additives in various plastics, however, have concerned toxicologists for many years as potential human health hazards: bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates.\n00523-X/fulltext#)\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.

The term plastic refers to a range of materials, with substances added to shape or stabilize it. The two most common stabilizers are:\n*   **Bisphenol A (BPA):** Used to make plastic harder\n*   **Phthalates:** Used to make plastic stronger and more flexible\nThese substances matter because BPA, and some phthalates, are considered endocrine disruptors, which mimic or block natural hormones in the body.  \n“It’s important to avoid substances that interfere with hormones,” says , a board-certified  and  doctor with . “These substances can lead to infertility; thyroid disease; early puberty; leukemia; breast, uterine and prostate cancers; neurobehavioral issues; obesity; and metabolic dysfunction.”\nThe study found that phthalates may contribute to over 100,000 premature deaths a year. People with the highest levels of phthalates had a greater risk of death from any cause, especially cardiovascular mortality.  \nSo is it time to toss your plastic storage collection? Not necessarily. While all the above sounds a bit scary, consider the following:\n1.  **The FDA regulates plastic.** The FDA makes certain determinations when it comes to plastic, such as how much of a chemical you can consume during your lifetime with little to no risk. While this doesn’t necessarily prevent some substances from being included in plastic, it ensures the amounts are within an estimated safe range.\n2.  **There are good plastics and bad plastics.** Some plastic materials are safer than others. You’ll want to avoid BPA entirely, and check the recycling symbol marked on the bottom. In general, avoid plastics with the numbers 1, 3, 6 or 7 on them. Safer options will be labeled 2, 4 and 5.\n3.  **It’s a bad idea to heat food in plastic.** According to the World Health Organization (WHO), microwaving food is generally safe. However, microwaving in plastic containers is associated with increased leaching — the transfer or leaking of chemicals into food. Note that even if a plastic container is labeled “microwave safe,” that simply means it won’t melt.\n**Store safe, heat safe, eat safe**  \nTo keep your food safe, whether you’re heating it or not, consider these general rules:\n1.  Choose phthalate-free and BPA-free products.\n2.  In the microwave, heat food in...[Content truncated]",

If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n_In_ _, we’re answering food-related questions that may or may not give you goosebumps. Today: Can you put plastic in the microwave?_\nIt all started by accident. Kazi Albab Hussain, a PhD student at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, was studying  released by certain types of plastic food packaging when he noticed another confetti-like substance under the microscope: tiny plastic bits.\nAs a new father he became preoccupied by the discovery. “I’d been exposed to a whole new world, and I was worried to see that a lot of baby foods were stored in plastic,” he says. So Hussain shifted gears in his research. He wanted to know: Just how many of these particles was his child eating?\nWatch\nQuite possibly billions, according to his . To test materials widely used in baby food packaging, Hussain brought a couple of store-bought polypropylene-based reusable plastic containers and a polyethylene-based reusable plastic food pouch back to his lab. Along with his team, he filled the storage vessels with water and 3% acetic acid to mimic the aqueous and acidic foods they might reasonably contain in real life. After storing the filled containers in the fridge or at room temperature for 10 days, the team found millions to billions of microplastics and nanoplastics in the liquids.\n the containers accelerated the process by an alarming magnitude: Within three minutes, some containers released as many as 4.22 million  (particles smaller than 5 millimeters) and 2.11 billion nanoplastics (particles about 70 times smaller than the width of a human hair) per square centimeter of surface area. Hussain’s research indicates we’re eating a lot more plastic than previously believed. In 2019  calculated we might be ingesting about 50,000 microplastic particles per year.\nThe health impacts of eating plastic is still unclear, but researchers have long suspected they’re not great. And  suggests high exposure to microplastics (and the lengthy list of chemicals they’re made from) could provoke immune and stress responses, along with various reproductive, metabolic, and behavioral issues.\nGiven the mounting concern around one of , Hussain’s findings beg a timely question: Can you put plastic in the microwave?\nWhat does microwaving do to plastic?\n------------------------------------\nPlastics are spaghetti-like chains of carbon molecules, called polymers, which are usually derived from crude oil.

As a new dad and a PhD student studying environmental nanotechnology, plastic was on his mind. The year before, scientists had  that plastic baby bottles shed millions of particles into formula, which infants end up swallowing (while also sucking on plastic bottle nipples). “At that time,” Hussain says, “I was purchasing many baby foods, and I was seeing that, even in baby foods, there are a lot of plastics.”\nHussain wanted to know how much was being released from the kinds of containers he’d been buying. So he went to the grocery store, picked up some baby food, and brought the empty containers back to his lab at the University of Nebraska—Lincoln. In a study published in June in , Hussain and his colleagues reported that, when microwaved, these containers released millions of bits of plastic, called microplastics, and even tinier nanoplastics.\nPlastics are complex cocktails of long chains of carbon, called polymers, mixed in with chemical additives, small molecules that help mold the polymers into their final shape and imbue them with resistance to oxidation, UV exposure, and other wear and tear.

Children and infants are at a greater risk to develop harmful health effects, though, and the FDA banned the use of BPA in baby bottles in 2012 and baby formula packaging in 2013.\nIt’s unclear what level of exposure to plastics’ endocrine-disrupting chemicals can lead to negative health outcomes. Most studies investigating plastic chemical exposure have looked at the effects on fetuses and animals, says Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor, a toxicologist and medical director at the National Capital Poison Center. The effects of plastic chemical exposure on human adults are still not well-understood.\nThis is because it’s difficult to study how exposure to microplastics and plastic chemical leaching affects adult human health. The best studies would require a control group that hasn’t been exposed, Dr. Johnson-Arbor explains.\n“In the U.S., we are all exposed to plastics,” she says, “You’d have to use a control group from … somewhere they don’t have any plastic. And that’s going to be hard.” Likewise, since plastics are a fairly recent phenomenon, having been popularized in the mid-20th century, it has proven difficult to study their long-term health effects.\nAs scientists work to understand how plastic exposure impacts health, Dr. Sheela Sathyanarayana, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington who studies exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, recommends taking reasonable precautions to limit unnecessary exposure. \nHeat is a key factor that increases the risk of exposure to harmful chemicals in plastic, she explains. “There have been several experiments that heating liquids or foods in plastics that contain these chemicals will certainly increase your exposure to them. And so that’s why we don’t recommend putting plastics in the microwave,” says Sathyanarayana.\nAnd microwaves aren’t the only kitchen appliance to keep your plastic containers away from. “We don’t recommend putting them in the dishwasher because it makes them degrade,” she says.\n“Even if a plastic container is labeled microwave safe, it simply means that it won’t melt,” explains Johnson-Arbor. It can still contain chemicals like BPA, phthalates or other potentially harmful materials unless it specifically says those aren’t included.\nTaking a look at the recycling number on your plastic can give a helpful hint (but not necessarily a definitive one). Plastic No. 3 likely contains DEHP, a phthalate, while plastic No. 7 may contain BPA. No. 6 contains styrene, a possible carcin...[Content truncated]",

But despite that knowledge, we sometimes fall into the trap of heating up our lunch packed Tupperware containers for the sake of time and convenience.\nIf you do a deep dive into the dangers of plastics in the kitchen, you would probably quit this bad habit cold turkey, but the truth is we’re all strapped for time and are just looking for a safe way to heat our leftovers in the microwave in less than two minutes.\nThat’s why we rounded up some quick guidance on how to microwave safely in a plastic world.\nWhat’s the Problem with Plastic, Anyway?\n----------------------------------------\nThe two key culprits to dangerous plastics are the man-made chemicals Phthalates and Bisphenol A (BPA), which are often added to plastic to help it keep its shape and pliability. In high volume, these substances have been linked to several negative health outcomes including ,  and . Pregnant people and children may be at greater risk of harmful effects. While these studies are not directly related to microwaving plastics, Phthalates and  are found in various types of food packaging, beauty products and other environmental exposure. In general, you may be able to reduce your exposure by steering clear of plastic with recycling codes 3 (phthalates) and 7 (bisphenols).\nExposing plastics to heat (like microwaving) can increase the risk of transferring these substances to your foods. Washing plastic containers in the heat of the dishwasher can also prompt them to leach chemicals and should also be avoided. If you must wash plastics marked “dishwasher safe,” place them in the top rack, far from the heating element, .\nSo, What Does That Mean for Microwaving?\n----------------------------------------\nMicrowaving provides enough heat to degrade or even melt certain types of plastic. For these reasons, follow  and only use clearly indicated “microwave safe” plastic containers that have been labeled accordingly. Cold storage containers like cottage cheese and yogurt cartons are not approved for use in the microwave.\nWant to avoid plastic all together?

Many people are especially concerned about microwaving at high temperatures or heating fatty or oily foods like cheese and meat. But plastic containers that release anything more than a very small amount of plasticizers are not approved for use in Canada.\nHow to safely store and reheat food\n-----------------------------------\n*   Use glass, ceramic and plastic containers and plastic wrap that are labelled as microwave safe. Always follow the instructions on the label when you use microwave-safe containers to heat food.\n*   Never heat or store food in plastic containers that were not intended for food. Single-use containers, like margarine tubs, tend to warp or melt in the microwave. This may allow more of the substances in the plastic to leach into the food.\n*   Let food cool before adding it to a plastic container, then put it in the fridge immediately. Avoid plastics that are visibly damaged or stained or have a bad smell.\nThe Canadian Cancer Society is committed to sharing important information about cancer risk to Canadians and will continue to monitor research in this area.\nOur enewsletter\nEnter your email to receive occasional news and important updates!\nYour email address \nSubscribe\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n...[Content truncated]",

Both of these can present health risks.\nThousands of chemicals are added to plastics to give them color, texture, softness, or rigidity. Of the 16,000 chemicals known to researchers, 3,200 are considered “substances of concern” because they are known to cause cancer, disrupt neural development, and hijack hormonal signals throughout the human body.\nEven at room temperature, many of the chemicals in plastics migrate into food. Micro- and nanoplastics also shed from plastic packaging into food at room temperature but the process of chemical migration and the shedding of microplastics both speed up when plastic is heated.\nHow does it affect our bodies?\nAs early as 2003, investigators published an article demonstrating that the “use of commercial plastic packages for repeated microwaving is associated with the risk of increased migration of volatile substances into food.” More recently, researchers testing baby food containers from two mainstream U.S. brands found that polypropylene (#5) labeled as \"microwave safe\" released 4.2 million and 1.2 billion particles per square centimeter of plastic each, after being heated in a microwave.\nEndocrine DisruptionMany of the chemicals that leach out of plastics into food or are consumed as microplastics are endocrine disruptors (EDCs) meaning that they “disrupt” the hormonal signals that regulate vital body processes. EDCs can disrupt appetite and metabolism (leading to obesity, diabetes, heart disease), cell growth regulation (cancers), and neurodevelopment (cognitive, learning and behavior disorders such as autism and ADHD). They can also impact the reproductive system (early puberty, infertility, and male birth defects).  \nCommon endocrine disrupting chemicals found in food packaging include ortho-phthalates, PFAS and perchlorate.\nMost At Risk As with other environmental toxicants, endocrine disruptors pose greater health risks for children than adults. They are particularly dangerous for newborns, toddlers, pregnant people, and the developing fetus.\nABOUT   CONTACT DONATE SEARCH PRIVACY POLICY\nCopyright © 2019-2024 Beyond Plastics.
