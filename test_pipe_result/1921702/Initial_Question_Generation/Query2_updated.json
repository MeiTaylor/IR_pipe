During a rescue mission in space, Jean is nearly killed when she is hit by a mysterious cosmic force. Once she returns home, this force not only makes her infinitely more powerful, but far more unstable. Wrestling with this entity inside her, Jean unleashes her powers in ways she can neither comprehend nor contain. With Jean spiraling out of control, and hurting the ones she loves most, she begins to unravel the very fabric that holds the X-Men together. Now, with this family falling apart, they must find a way to unite -- not only to save Jean\u2019s soul, but to save our very planet from aliens who wish to weaponize this force and rule the galaxy.\n**Written and Directed By**: Simon Kinberg\n**Cast**:\n*   James McAvoy as Charles Xavier/Professor X\n*   Michael Fassbender as Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto\n*   Jennifer Lawrence as Raven Darkholme/Mystique\n*   Nicholas Hoult as Hank McCoy/Beast\n*   Sophie Turner as Jean Grey/Phoenix\n*   Tye Sheridan as Scott Summers/Cyclops\n*   Alexandra Shipp as Ororo Munroe/Storm\n*   Evan Peters as Peter Maximoff/Quicksilver\n*   Kodi Smit-McPhee as Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler\n*   Jessica Chastain as Vuk/Margaret\n*   Scott Shepherd as John Grey\n*   Ato Essandoh as Jones\n*   Brian D'...[Content truncated]",

And all this while he\u2019s trying to remodel his kitchen.\nAs Nichols continues to track down tantalizing clues, everything leads to an explosive confrontation that turns his life upside down. The case is cracked and the culprits brought in. But don\u2019t expect too many definitive answers: _Reptile_\u2019s mystery will be solved, but you won\u2019t be spoon-fed the finer details. \u201cOne of the things I love about movies is that they can be enigmatic, you can leave viewers with questions,\u201d director Grant Singer tells Tudum. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why I\u2019m leaving these questions unanswered.\u201d\nStill, Singer won\u2019t leave you entirely in the dark.

But, as Nichols and his wife Judy (Alicia Silverstone) soon learn, the answer to this particular mystery is more complicated than just one perp.\nIn its third act, _Reptile_ reveals that Summer was killed to prevent her from speaking to the FBI about a scam that implicates every level of Nichols\u2019 own police department. \u201c\\ is faced with this moral decision to do the right thing and sacrifice his stability, his livelihood, his career, or keep his mouth shut,\u201d Singer says. \u201cAnd he makes a decision to do the right thing.\u201d That means bringing what he knows to the people he trusts \u2014 including his wife\u2019s uncle, Robert Allen (Eric Bogosian), and his chief, Marty Graeber (Mike Pniewski).

We\u2019re over-saturated with cinematic blockbusters, VOD releases and original films from various streaming platforms. Annoyingly, many of these films are actually quite decent.\nSo we\u2019ve got to pick and choose. Most of us don\u2019t have time to watch all of these films. We have to abstain from some, indulge in others. I\u2019ve tried to watch out for smaller films, the cinematic gems that are often unfairly ignored by their more marketable counterparts. One of those films on my radar was\u00a0HBO\u2019s prison drama _O.G._\nAs time went by, I must admit I had forgotten about its existence. Like I said before, there are just too many movies coming out. I\u2019m both excited (_Deadwood_, _Dragged Across Concrete_ and ) and increasingly bored by them (whatever millionth Marvel or Live-action Disney remake is coming out)_._ It\u2019s simply not easy remembering all of them.\nSo when I suddenly came across this film while perusing HBO, my excitement rushed back to me. I knew I had to see it.\nThe following review will be spoiler free.\n**Synopsis**\n------------\n**_Directed By:_** Madeleine Sackler\n**_Written By:_** Stephen Belber\n**_Starring:_** , Theothus Carter, William Fichtner, David Patrick Kelly, Mare Winningham, Ryan Cutrona, Ato Essandoh, Kevin Jackson with Vul Vazquez and  as Pinkins\nAn aging jailbird, Louis (Jeffrey Wright), is on the brink of early release after spending twenty-four years inside. He has spent nearly half of his life in prison. The prospect of freedom is partly a blessing, as he will be able to amend a relationship with his sister and her family. At the same time, the unknown future and the different rules out there also frightens Louis.\nBut freedom is exactly what Louis has been working so hard for; having kept his head down without making any enemies inside, from either his fellow convicts to the guards, who are led by the amiable warden Danvers (William Fichtner).\nAll of this is threatening to change after Louis befriends a young convict, Beecher (Theothus Carter)....[Content truncated]",
