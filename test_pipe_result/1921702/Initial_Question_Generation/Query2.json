During a rescue mission in space, Jean is nearly killed when she is hit by a mysterious cosmic force. Once she returns home, this force not only makes her infinitely more powerful, but far more unstable. Wrestling with this entity inside her, Jean unleashes her powers in ways she can neither comprehend nor contain. With Jean spiraling out of control, and hurting the ones she loves most, she begins to unravel the very fabric that holds the X-Men together.

Now, Joe has shifted from fits of laughter to shrieks of terror as he makes his directorial debut with  film _Outpost._\n### Speaking to FILMHOUNDS, Joe talked to us about the perils of filming on location, working with his wife in the lead role, and how his _Brooklyn Nine-Nine_ castmates helped make the film what it is today.\n**_Outpost_ is getting a digital release.

Some people are really excited about it, others are a bit unnerved by it, but overall, it's been wonderful to have such a warm reception for something that is very different from what I normally do.\n**What was it that inspired you to take the leap from acting into writing and directing?**\n...[Content truncated]",

That’s where Nichols comes in, as he and his partner, Cleary (Ato Essandoh), are called to the scene. As their investigation proceeds, plenty of people come under suspicion, including Will himself. Also on the suspect list: the Grady family’s aggrieved stalker, Eli (Michael Carmen Pitt), and Summer’s soon-to-be ex-husband, Sam (Karl Glusman). But, as Nichols and his wife Judy (Alicia Silverstone) soon learn, the answer to this particular mystery is more complicated than just one perp.\nIn its third act, _Reptile_ reveals that Summer was killed to prevent her from speaking to the FBI about a scam that implicates every level of Nichols’ own police department. “\\ is faced with this moral decision to do the right thing and sacrifice his stability, his livelihood, his career, or keep his mouth shut,” Singer says. “And he makes a decision to do the right thing.” That means bringing what he knows to the people he trusts — including his wife’s uncle, Robert Allen (Eric Bogosian), and his chief, Marty Graeber (Mike Pniewski). Unfortunately for Nichols, they’re both in on it.\n“It's more like , where you realize, ‘Oh my God, they’re all involved,’ right?” Singer notes. “What Benicio’s character is facing is that he realizes it’s much more of a conspiracy, and that there’s much more culpability from all these different people that he trusted.” Things...[Content truncated]",

Kwesi prays in Hebrew when the going gets tough on the spacecraft — it happens often during the crew’s multi-year journey — and early on he notes that he brought aboard a Torah.\nLuckily for Essandoh, he already had the Jewish side of his role down, as he put it, since he had previously portrayed a Black Jewish character — Dr. Isidore Latham on “Chicago Med.”\n“The British part was the problem — I was like, now I have to learn a dialect! But I said, ‘OK, I have the Jewish thing down,’” he said with a laugh on the phone from his home in Brooklyn.\nHe also had a head start on learning Jewish culture from his childhood in upstate New York, where he said he was surrounded by Jewish friends and brought up by parents who encouraged him to explore different histories and belief systems — ranging from Norse mythology to the New Testament to the fairy tale stories of West Africa.\nThe role of Kwesi is just the latest in a wide-ranging career that kicked into high gear after a supporting part as Natalie Portman’s adopted brother in Zach Braff’s 2004 indie hit “Garden State.” Essandoh, now 48, spoke with the Jewish Telegraphic Agency about Black-Jewish representation on screen, his favorite Jewish prayer and his family’s obsession with bagels.\nThis interview was edited and condensed...[Content truncated]",

Annoyingly, many of these films are actually quite decent.\nSo we’ve got to pick and choose. Most of us don’t have time to watch all of these films. We have to abstain from some, indulge in others. I’ve tried to watch out for smaller films, the cinematic gems that are often unfairly ignored by their more marketable counterparts. One of those films on my radar was HBO’s prison drama _O.G._\nAs time went by, I must admit I had forgotten about its existence. Like I said before, there are just too many movies coming out. I’m both excited (_Deadwood_, _Dragged Across Concrete_ and ) and increasingly bored by them (whatever millionth Marvel or Live-action Disney remake is coming out)_._ It’s simply not easy remembering all of them.\nSo when I suddenly came across this film while perusing HBO, my excitement rushed back to me. I knew I had to see it.\nThe following review will be spoiler free.\n**Synopsis**\n------------\n**_Directed By:_** Madeleine Sackler\n**_Written By:_** Stephen Belber\n**_Starring:_** , Theothus Carter, William Fichtner, David Patrick Kelly, Mare Winningham, Ryan Cutrona, Ato Essandoh, Kevin Jackson with Vul Vazquez and  as Pinkins\nAn aging jailbird, Louis (Jeffrey Wright), is on the brink of early release after spending twenty-four years inside. He has spent nearly half of his life in prison. The prospect of freedom is partly a blessing, as he will be able to amend a relationship with his sister and her family. At the same time, the unknown future and the different rules out there also frightens Louis.\nBut freedom is exactly what Louis has been working so hard for; having kept his head down without making any enemies inside, from either his fellow convicts to the guards, who are led by the amiable warden Danvers (William Fichtner).\nAll of this is threatening to change after Louis befriends a young convict, Beecher (Theothus Carter)....[Content truncated]",
