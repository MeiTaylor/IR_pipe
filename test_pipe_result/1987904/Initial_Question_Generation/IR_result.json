                "content": "[Content truncated]...=================================================================\n**Photo: Photo: Randall Simons/Polaris.**\nI can remember a period in the mid-'90s when my mom forbade me from looking at the magazines in the grocery store checkout. They were plastered with pictures of a little girl around my age, whose bright blue eyes and bouncy blonde curls were so perfectly doll-like that at first glance she didn't seem to be real. But JonBenét Ramsey's face is the kind that sticks in your mind. She was a radiant, beautiful child — that's one reason people still remember her. Another one: her tragic murder, which has remained unsolved for nearly 20 years. Conspiracy theorists, not to mention actual detectives, are still stuck on decoding clues that would finally break her case. Now, a video making the rounds suggests that JonBenét has been alive all along — and living her life undercover as the singer Katy Perry, no less. The theory is not only insane, it's highly offensive to the Ramsey family after everything they've been through. In 2014, YouTube user Dave Johnson  in which he claims, via voice-over, that Ramsey is living undercover as Katy Perry. \"Nobody died, nobody got hurt. That sacrifice was in name only, and that was to get something, and that something was to become a star,\" he says. \"JonBenét became Katy Perry, and that’s a fact.” The video suggests that Perry's parents are actually Patsy and John Ramsey in disguise as Keith Hudson and Mary Perry. \"He shaved his head. She lost some weight,\" Johnson explains, as though that's enough evidence to prove that four distinct people are, in actuality, two skillful pretenders who have been keeping up a decades-long charade. (Patsy Ramsey, a former beauty queen herself, died in 2006; her ex-husband, John, has since remarried. Katy Perry's parents are both alive and  in their daughter's life.) The problem here isn't Johnson's proof or lack thereof: The video is inarguably invalid, and no one is entertaining the idea that there's any truth to it. What's fucked up is that — _even though we all know there isn't a kernel of truth in the theory_ — it's still making the rounds on the internet, where people are suddenly comparing a dead child's features with those of a 31-year-old pop singer.\nAdvertisementADVERTISEMENT\n> This dude is insane...but they DO look exactly alike: Is Katy Perry actually JonBenét Ramsey?  via \n...[Content truncated]",

John Ramsey was remarried in 2011 to fashion designer Jan Rousseaux.\n\"He shaved his head, she lost some weight,\" Johnson alleges as he compares photos of the parents.\n****\nAnother hole in this conspiracy theory is the age difference of Perry and Ramsey.

            "content": "[Content truncated]...=================================================================\n**Photo: Photo: Randall Simons/Polaris.**\nI can remember a period in the mid-'90s when my mom forbade me from looking at the magazines in the grocery store checkout. They were plastered with pictures of a little girl around my age, whose bright blue eyes and bouncy blonde curls were so perfectly doll-like that at first glance she didn't seem to be real. But JonBenét Ramsey's face is the kind that sticks in your mind. She was a radiant, beautiful child — that's one reason people still remember her. Another one: her tragic murder, which has remained unsolved for nearly 20 years. Conspiracy theorists, not to mention actual detectives, are still stuck on decoding clues that would finally break her case. Now, a video making the rounds suggests that JonBenét has been alive all along — and living her life undercover as the singer Katy Perry, no less. The theory is not only insane, it's highly offensive to the Ramsey family after everything they've been through. In 2014, YouTube user Dave Johnson  in which he claims, via voice-over, that Ramsey is living undercover as Katy Perry. \"Nobody died, nobody got hurt. That sacrifice was in name only, and that was to get something, and that something was to become a star,\" he says. \"JonBenét became Katy Perry, and that’s a fact.” The video suggests that Perry's parents are actually Patsy and John Ramsey in disguise as Keith Hudson and Mary Perry. \"He shaved his head. She lost some weight,\" Johnson explains, as though that's enough evidence to prove that four distinct people are, in actuality, two skillful pretenders who have been keeping up a decades-long charade. (Patsy Ramsey, a former beauty queen herself, died in 2006; her ex-husband, John, has since remarried. Katy Perry's parents are both alive and  in their daughter's life.) The problem here isn't Johnson's proof or lack thereof: The video is inarguably invalid, and no one is entertaining the idea that there's any truth to it. What's fucked up is that — _even though we all know there isn't a kernel of truth in the theory_ — it's still making the rounds on the internet, where people are suddenly comparing a dead child's features with those of a 31-year-old pop singer.\nAdvertisementADVERTISEMENT\n> This dude is insane...but they DO look exactly alike: Is Katy Perry actually JonBenét Ramsey?  via \n...[Content truncated]"

    "QA": {
        "Question": "Is there credible evidence that Katy Perry is JonBenét Ramsey and her death was faked?",
        "Answer": "There is no credible evidence to support the claim that Katy Perry is actually JonBenét Ramsey and that her death was faked. Numerous sources, including Billboard, have stated that the theory claiming Katy Perry is JonBenét Ramsey is unfounded and 'obviously not' true. The article highlights that while conspiracy theorists have circulated various videos supporting this idea, they have no basis in reality and are dismissed by reasoned analysis. JonBenét Ramsey was a six-year-old girl who was tragically murdered in 1996, and her death was ruled a homicide. According to multiple credible reports, including her Wikipedia page, the circumstances surrounding her death are well-documented, with details of the investigation revealing that there was a ransom note found, and her body was discovered in the basement of her home. The investigation remains one of the most publicized unsolved cases; importantly, no credible evidence has emerged to suggest she survived or is in hiding. Media discussions have also pointed out the offensive nature of the conspiracy theory towards the Ramsey family, as it trivializes the tragic death of a child for sensational speculation. Such theories often arise from baseless and misleading analyses comparing photographs and features, but they lack any legitimate evidentiary support.",
