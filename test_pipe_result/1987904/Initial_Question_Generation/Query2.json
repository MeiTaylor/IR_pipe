Boulder police initially concentrated almost exclusively upon John and Patsy Ramsey, although their records showed no sign of any prior criminal conduct.\\ For many years, the Boulder police held to the position that Patsy Ramsey had injured JonBenét in a fit of rage after the girl had wet her bed—and that she then killed her either in a rage or to cover up the injury.\nThe Ramseys' son Burke, who was nine years old at the time of JonBenét's death, was also considered a possible suspect in media reports. Burke was later asked to testify at a grand jury hearing. In 1999, the Governor of Colorado, Bill Owens, told the parents of JonBenét Ramsey to \"quit hiding behind their attorneys, quit hiding behind their PR firm.\nLou Smit, a seasoned detective who came out of retirement to assist Boulder authorities with the case in early 1997, originally suspected the Ramsey parents. After assessing all the evidence that had been collected, Smit concluded that an intruder had committed the crime. In his book The Cases That Haunt Us, former FBI agent John E. Douglas (hired by the Ramsey family) writes that he quibbled with a few of Smit's interpretations but agreed with the general thrust of Smit's investigation and conclusions. Douglas particularly praised Smit's discovery in autopsy photos of what appeared to be previously-overlooked evidence of a \"stun gun\" having been used to subdue JonBenét. While no longer an official investigator on the case, Smit continued to work on it until his death in 2010.\nStephen Singular, an investigative journalist and author of the book Presumed Guilty: An Investigation into the JonBenet Ramsey Case, the Media and the Culture of Pornography, suggested the existence of a connection of the murder to the industry of child pornography. He refers to consultations with cyber-crime specialists who believe that JonBenét, due to her beauty pageant experience, was the perfect kind of child who could be dragged into the world of child pornography and was a natural candidate to attract attention and pedophiles.\nOn October 25, 2013, previously sealed court documents were released, showing that a Colorado grand jury had voted in 1999 to indict the parents, John and Patricia Ramsey, for the girl's murder. The indictment alleged child abuse resulting in death and being accessories to a crime. However, Alex Hunter, who was the district attorney in 1999, refused to sign the indictment, saying that the evidence was insufficient.This left the impression that the grand jury investigation had been inconclusive.\nNot long after the murder, the parents moved to a...[Content truncated]",

Online Conspiracy Theory Goes Viral (Video)\n==========================================================================\nYouTube user Dave Johnson is adamant — and angry\n!\nFebruary 26, 2016 @ 7:14 AM\nShare on Social Media\n---------------------\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   )\nYouTube user Dave Johnson is either completely crazy or a mastermind Internet sleuth, depending on who’s watching his prized online conspiracy theory video.\nJohnson claims that JonBenet Ramsey didn’t actually die, rather her family set up the elaborate hoax so their little girl would grow up to become a star. That star was renamed , Johnson claims.\n“JonBenet Ramsey did not die. Nobody died, nobody got hurt,” he says via voiceover in a year-old YouTube post that for some reason is going viral this morning. “That sacrifice was in-name only, and that sacrifice was to get something — and that something was to become a star.”\n“JonBenet Ramsey became . That’s a fact,” Johnson continued. “So if any of you continue to lie about this person dying, you are a false witness to murder. That’s a fact.”\nJohnson then blends the photographed faces of JonBenet Ramsey and (“the character of”) Perry. He gives the same treatment to pictures of Ramsey’s parents, and Perry’s parents.\n“He shaved his head, she lost some weight,” he opines on the mom(s) and dad(s). “That’s about it.”\nThe uploader’s summary reads: “Stop being Liars for the system. No bodies Died, She is still singing OBVIOUSLY. False death liars are going to Burn count on it.”\n above, and worry for this man.\nThis isn’t the only video like this that Johnson has made, and he really likes the blending faces effect.\nJohnson has since claimed on YouTube the Civil War was all a hoax too, and that no one died or got hurt. He also tried to rip the lid off of 9/11,...[Content truncated]",

A detective who worked on the investigation for a time wrote a book about the case in which he asserted that Patsy Ramsey killed JonBenet because the child had wet the bed.\nWednesday, John Ramsey speculated that people wanted to believe her parents killed JonBenet because “people want an answer to that horrendous a crime. It’s hard for people to accept that someone would come into a home and murder a child. We were perhaps an answer.”\nMary Lacy’s exoneration clearly has not satisfied those who believe one or both of the Ramseys were involved in the murder. By late Wednesday, the numerous websites that continue to dissect the case were filled with posts expressing disgust and doubt about the findings. One even contains a countdown clock until Lacy’s term of office expires and the Ramseys might be brought to justice.\n**Fake confession**\nConfidence in Lacy’s handling of the case took a serious hit in 2006, when she had John Mark Karr flown from Thailand to Boulder after the former teacher confessed to killing JonBenet. Karr was held in the Boulder County Jail for days until investigators determined he had been nowhere near Boulder when JonBenet was killed.\nNevertheless, until her term expires, Lacy has said her office will continue to investigate the case and hope that new entries in a national DNA database might eventually identify a suspect.\nIn the 9News interview Wednesday, John Ramsey said that JonBenet’s death had been “a near-mortal wound.”\n“She was the spark plug in our family, and the loss of that presence was just crushing.”\nAsked if he had any idea who the killer might be, Ramsey said no.\n“I don’t. I’ve always said I don’t know anyone that evil.”\n_Karen Auge: 303-954-1733 or _\n* * *\n### Ex...[Content truncated]",
