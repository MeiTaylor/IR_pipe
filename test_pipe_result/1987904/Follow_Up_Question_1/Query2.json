You probably have your own opinions as to what happened, or who left the alleged ransom letter. But, have you ever once entertained the possibility that Ramsey is not dead, and that she grew up to be multi-platinum pop superstar Katy Perry?\nConsider the many facts from master YouTube detective Dave Johnson:\n\\- Overlapping photos of Katy Perry and JonBenet Ramsey look like overlapping photos of Katy Perry and JonBenet Ramsey.\n\\- Overlapping photos of JonBenet Ramsey's parents and Katy Perry's parents look like overlapping photos of Katy Perry and JonBenet Ramsey's parents.\nHe explains these two facts in a very thorough 7-minute video. And if you don't believe in this very clear cut explanation, you are \"a false witness to murder and death.\" Nevermind the fact that Katy Perry was born in 1984, six years before Ramsey. But how does this explain ?\nAnd just think, this time last week we were talking about .\n###### Watch Next\n!!\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n-------------------------------------------------------\n ‘Squid Game’ Season 2 Is Ready to Play] Charlize Theron's Life in Photos] The Best Action Movies of 2024 (So Far)] Live from New York, It's ‘Saturday Night’!]\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n The Best Albums of 2024 (So Far)] The 20 Best Halloween Movies on Netflix] 15 Shows Like ‘House of the Dragon’] Every Dragon on ‘House of the Dragon’ So Far]\n Who Is Lady Deadpool in ‘Deadpool & Wolverine’?] The Best 'House...[Content truncated]",

For today’s True Crime Thursday post, I resurrected the most-read piece from my personal site at  Drawing on thirty-plus years of hands-on experience in human death investigations, these are my thoughts about who really murdered JonBenet Ramsay:\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\nOn December 26, 1996, the beaten and strangled body of six-year-old JonBenet Ramsey was found hidden in the basement of her Boulder, Colorado home. Immediately, police and media suspicion focused on her wealthy parents, John Bennet Ramsey and Patricia (Patsy) Ramsey, as being responsible. Now—twenty-five years later—the child beauty queen’s cold case has little new to offer except for the stupid suggestion that JonBenet never really died and that she’s actually the pop-star, Katy Perry.\nSetting crazy conspiracy theories aside, the fact remains that someone viciously slaughtered JonBenet. The little girl became a cultural obsession, and the person or persons guilty of JonBenet’s murder were never prosecuted. Was it a lack of viable suspects? Lack of admissible evidence? A homicide investigation mishandled right from the start? Or was it failure to properly decipher the murder mystery’s most important clue—the ransom note?\nHere’s a look at what the case facts tell us about who really murdered JonBenet Ramsey.\n! Patsy Ramsey claimed to have come downstairs to the kitchen at five o’clock on Boxing Day morning and found a two-and-a-half page, hand-written ransom note on the landing of their secondary staircase. The author directed the letter at John Ramsey and claimed to represent a group of individuals from a foreign faction who were “in possession” of JonBenet. The note demanded a ransom of $118,000 be paid in certain bills or JonBenet would die.\nBoulder Police recorded Patsy Ramsey’s report being phoned in at 5:51 am...[Content truncated]",

However, there is no evidence to support this theory and it remains just that - a theory.\nBritney Spears quickly became a household name with her rise to fame in the late 90's. However, some people believe that the Britney we see today is not the original. Instead, they claimed that she was a Brittany Spears clone following her breakdown in 2007.\nSupporters of the theory point to changes in her appearance, her behavior, and the fact that she has not been seen in public for extended periods of time. While this theory may seem far-fetched, it continues to be a topic of conversation among conspiracy theorists.\nCheck out these 5 Powerful Documentaries About Britney Spears\nKeanu Reeves has been a Hollywood staple for over three decades, but some people believe that the actor isn't just talented - he's also immortal. The theory suggests that Reeves is a part of a secret society that has existed for centuries and that he has been photographed in various historical events throughout time.\nSupporters of this theory point to the fact that Reeves hasn't aged much over the years and that his characters often have similarities in their appearance. While it's unlikely that Reeves is immortal, this theory is certainly an interesting one.\nOne of the craziest conspiracy theories circulating around Hollywood is that the Church of Scientology held auditions to find Tom Cruise's next wife.\nThe theory suggests that the church wanted someone who would be a good public face for the religion and that the \"winning\" candidate would have the opportunity to marry Cruise. The church has denied these claims, but the theory still persists.\nCheck out these 13 Shocking Documentaries About Scientology\nOne of the most popular celebrity conspiracy theories is that the moon landing was faked. The theory suggests that the government could not successfully accomplish the moon landing, so they hired the famous film director Stanley Kubrick to fake it.\nThe theory goes on to claim that Kubrick included secret messages in his films to reveal the truth. While there is no evidence to support this theory, it continues to be a topic of debate among conspiracy theorists.\nCheck out our podcast episode on Wonderful: Stories From the Space Station\nThe theory that Avril Lavigne died and was replaced by a lookalike surfaced in 2005, and since then, it has not faded away.

Douglas Harpool to 17 years in federal prison without parole.\nOn June 6, 2023, Puckett was found guilty at trial of one count of receiving child pornography. Puckett, a registered sex offender, has two prior felony convictions for statutory rape and a prior felony conviction for statutory sodomy.\n!\nGet our free mobile app\nA Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper initiated a traffic stop near the intersection of Highway 13 and East 316 Road in Bolivar, Mo., on Aug. 28, 2020. The trooper, who learned that Puckett was a registered sex offender, searched Puckett’s vehicle and found a cell phone plugged into a cigarette lighter.\nWhen the phone’s screen activated, the trooper noticed Puckett had Facebook and Snapchat applications on the phone, which were not authorized due to Puckett’s status as a registered sex offender. The trooper seized Puckett’s phone, on which he located multiple images of child pornography, and Puckett was then arrested.\nInvestigators conducted a forensic examination of Puckett’s phone and found hundreds of images of child pornography.\nThis case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney James J. Kelleher. It was investigated by the Missouri State Highway Patrol.\nWeirdest Celebrity Conspiracy Theories\n--------------------------------------\nFrom immortal stars to secret twins and fake baby bumps, these celebrity conspiracy theories are literally too weird to be true.\nGallery Credit: Erica Russell\nFiled Under: , , , \nCategories: , \nMore From AM 1050 KSIS\n----------------------\n]\nClinton Man Arrested For Possession Of Child Pornography\n]\nFormer Camden County SRO Arrested For Possession & Promoting Child Porn\n]\nSedalia Man Arrested For Promoting Child Pornography\n]\nFulton Man Arrested for Possession Of Child Pornography\n]\nWarrensburg Man Arrested For Child Porn, Sexual Exploitation Of A Child\n]\nMarshall Man Arrested For Possession Of Child Pornography\n]\nThree Johnson County Men Arrested For Promotion Of Child Pornography\n]\nKnob Noster Man Arrested On Child Porn Charges\n]\nTwo Warrensburg Men Arrested on Child Porn Charges\nInformation\n-----------\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n...[Content truncated]",

It's the real-life story of JonBenét Ramsey, the six-year-old beauty pageant queen who was discovered murdered in her own home on the morning of December 26, 1996. As far as true crime or media spectacles go, JonBenét's is the one I've followed most vigorously, the one that occupies the biggest residency in my mind. Now with the release of Kitty Green's new Netflix documentary Casting JonBenét, I find myself thinking about—and remembering what I thought about—the incident again.\nThe American public was still grappling with the O.J. Simpson case from two years before, but I can only vaguely remember that one—I was too young to comprehend the politics involved or even have reference points for the celebrity status that made O.J.'s trial such a stranger-than-fiction tale. But the JonBenét Ramsey case I remember so vividly because she was my age—both of us born in 1990—and that fact alone shook me to my core, even though I didn't yet know or understand all that had happened.\nOn Christmas morning, JonBenét's mother called 911 to report her daughter missing and a ransom note left behind asking for $118,000—it was two and a half pages long, which is unprecedented in length, and written at the scene, which is unprecedented in its lack of premeditation. After the cops arrived, it was JonBenét's father, John Ramsey, who found her body in the basement of her home hours later. She was hit over the head with a blunt object, which fractured her skull, then strangled to death an hour or two later. The police also found evidence of vaginal trauma and DNA left on her underwear.

(Just me? OK.) Well, identical twin jokes aren't what we're going for with this article. No, we're referring to the celebrities whom conspiracy theories believe have either been cloned and/or are being impersonated.\nMany of these theories posit celebs have died and their replicas are walking among us. Disney's Alice better be thankful she never fell down this twisted rabbit hole. Check out these crazy theories below.\nYouTuber Kendall Rae talked about this insane theory in a video from October 2018.\nApparently, some people believe Post Malone and Justin Bieber are the same person. \"Why... how...,\" you ask? According to Kendall, \"If you pitch down a Justin Bieber song, it starts to sound like Post Malone, and if you pitch up a Post Malone song, it sounds like Justin Bieber.\"\nNot gonna lie, they do actually sound alike.\nOne day, Miley Cyrus is being cute, innocent Hannah Montana on Disney Channel. The next, she's grinding onstage and dancing ~provocatively~. According to one theory, Disney allegedly killed the starlet and dumped her body in the California desert after her rebellious streak went too far. Some people think she was either cloned or one of her background dancers (some say body double) is pretending to be her.\nEven more bizarre, one YouTube video claims Miley is a Draco Reptilian Shapeshifter Hybrid and that she blinks sideways.\nTheorists believe producers got ahold of some of Bey's stem cells back when she first started singing, knowing her talent would be such a waste if she died prematurely. Apparently, they claim Bey died in 2000 (though some think it was in 1999), making the Beyoncé we know and love today a clone.\nZeena LaVey, aka Zeena Sch...[Content truncated]",
