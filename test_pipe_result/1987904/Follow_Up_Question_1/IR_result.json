States\n*   Switch To\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \nConspiracy Theorists Suggest Katy Perry Is Really JonBenét Ramsey\n=================================================================\n!\n**Photo: Photo: Randall Simons/Polaris.**\nI can remember a period in the mid-'90s when my mom forbade me from looking at the magazines in the grocery store checkout. They were plastered with pictures of a little girl around my age, whose bright blue eyes and bouncy blonde curls were so perfectly doll-like that at first glance she didn't seem to be real. But JonBenét Ramsey's face is the kind that sticks in your mind. She was a radiant, beautiful child — that's one reason people still remember her. Another one: her tragic murder, which has remained unsolved for nearly 20 years. Conspiracy theorists, not to mention actual detectives, are still stuck on decoding clues that would finally break her case. Now, a video making the rounds suggests that JonBenét has been alive all along — and living her life undercover as the singer Katy Perry, no less. The theory is not only insane, it's highly offensive to the Ramsey family after everything they've been through. In 2014, YouTube user Dave Johnson  in which he claims, via voice-over, that Ramsey is living undercover as Katy Perry. \"Nobody died, nobody got hurt. That sacrifice was in name only, and that was to get something, and that something was to become a star,\" he says. \"JonBenét became Katy Perry, and that’s a fact.” The video suggests that Perry's parents are actually Patsy and John Ramsey in disguise as Keith Hudson and Mary Perry. \"He shaved his head. She lost some weight,\" Johnson explains, as though that's enough evidence to prove that four distinct people are, in actuality, two skillful pretenders who have been keeping up a decades-long charade. (Patsy Ramsey, a former beauty queen herself, died in 2006; her ex-husband, John, has since remarried. Katy Perry's parents are both alive and  in their daughter's life.) The problem here isn't Johnson's proof or lack thereof: The video is inarguably invalid, and no one is entertaining the idea that there's any truth to it. What's fucked up is that — _even though we all know there isn't a kernel of truth in the theory_ — it's still making the rounds on the internet, where people are suddenly comparing a dead child's features with those of a 31-year-old pop singer.\nAdvertisementADVERTISEMENT\n>...[Content truncated]",

Some of them are backed by celebrities: Christine Ebersole, for instance, believes that 9/11 was an inside job, and Kylie Jenner is pretty certain our government is trying to poison us using commercial airliners. And then some involve celebrities themselves: Beyoncé thinks all her haters are corny with that Illuminati mess and, thanks to the work of the Daily Dot’s Rick Paulas, the latest great celebrity conspiracy theory is that Katy Perry is JonBenét Ramsey all grown up.\nLet’s start with the background. JonBenét Ramsey was born August 6, 1990, in Atlanta, Georgia. The day after Christmas 1996, Ramsay’s body was found in her parents’ basement in Boulder, Colorado; she had been strangled to death. Her killer was never caught. That is, unless, she never really died at all, adopted a new identity, and became global superstar Katy Perry.\nThere is a relatively small but incredibly dedicated community on YouTube devoted to proving conspiracies of various and increasingly obvious fictionality. One of those is that rather than die at age 6, JonBenét became Katy Perry. The why of the matter isn’t really so important but it has something to...[Content truncated]",

In 2014, YouTube user Dave Johnson  in which he claims, via voice-over, that Ramsey is living undercover as Katy Perry. \"Nobody died, nobody got hurt. That sacrifice was in name only, and that was to get something, and that something was to become a star,\" he says. \"JonBenét became Katy Perry, and that’s a fact.” The video suggests that Perry's parents are actually Patsy and John Ramsey in disguise as Keith Hudson and Mary Perry. \"He shaved his head. She lost some weight,\" Johnson explains, as though that's enough evidence to prove that four distinct people are, in actuality, two skillful pretenders who have been keeping up a decades-long charade. (Patsy Ramsey, a former beauty queen herself, died in 2006; her ex-husband, John, has since remarried. Katy Perry's parents are both alive and  in their daughter's life.) The problem here isn't Johnson's proof or lack thereof: The video is inarguably invalid, and no one is entertaining the idea that there's any truth to it. What's fucked up is that — _even though we all know there isn't a kernel of truth in the theory_ — it's still making the rounds on the internet, where people are suddenly comparing a dead child's features with those of a 31-year-old pop singer.\nAdvertisementADVERTISEMENT\n>...[Content truncated]"

    "QA": {
        "Question": "What are the origins of the conspiracy theory linking Katy Perry to JonBenét Ramsey and who promotes it?",
        "Answer": "The conspiracy theory linking Katy Perry to JonBenét Ramsey originated largely from a viral YouTube video created by a user named Dave Johnson, published in 2014. In this video, Johnson claims that JonBenét Ramsey, who was murdered in 1996, did not actually die but instead grew up to become Katy Perry, suggesting that her death was staged to allow her to live under a different identity. This theory has been circulated and perpetuated by conspiracy theorists who buy into his argument without any credible backing. The theory gained significant media attention around February 2016 when it became a topic of discussion across various platforms. Articles highlight that this speculation is not only unfounded but also highly offensive to the Ramsey family, who have endured the tragedy of their daughter’s murder and the subsequent scrutiny it attracted. The supporters of this theory often point to supposed similarities in appearances or family backgrounds, but these claims lack tangible evidence and are based on superficial comparisons rather than substantive proof. In essence, this conspiracy theory is propagated by a mix of dubious online content and anecdotal comparisons rather than credible investigative journalism or factual evidence. The idea has become a part of internet folklore, despite being dismissed by reputable sources.",
