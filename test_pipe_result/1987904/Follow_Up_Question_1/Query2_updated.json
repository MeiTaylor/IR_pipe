You probably have your own opinions as to what happened, or who left the alleged ransom letter.\u00a0But, have you ever once entertained the possibility that Ramsey is not dead, and that she\u00a0grew up to be multi-platinum pop superstar Katy Perry?\nConsider the many\u00a0facts from master YouTube detective Dave Johnson:\n\\- Overlapping photos of Katy Perry and JonBenet Ramsey look like overlapping photos of Katy Perry and JonBenet Ramsey.\n\\- Overlapping photos of JonBenet Ramsey's parents and Katy Perry's parents look like overlapping photos of Katy Perry and JonBenet Ramsey's parents.\nHe explains these two facts in a very thorough 7-minute video. And if you don't believe in this very clear cut explanation, you are \"a false witness to murder and death.\" Nevermind the fact that Katy Perry was born in 1984, six years before Ramsey.

The author directed the letter at John Ramsey and claimed to represent a group of individuals from a foreign faction who were \u201cin possession\u201d of JonBenet. The note demanded a ransom of $118,000 be paid in certain bills or JonBenet would die.\nBoulder Police recorded Patsy Ramsey\u2019s report being phoned in at 5:51 am...[Content truncated]",

However, there is no evidence to support this theory and it remains just that - a theory.\nBritney Spears quickly became a household name with her rise to fame in the late 90's. However, some people believe that the Britney we see today is not the original. Instead, they claimed that she was a Brittany Spears clone following her breakdown in 2007.\nSupporters of the theory point to changes in her appearance, her behavior, and the fact that she has not been seen in public for extended periods of time. While this theory may seem far-fetched, it continues to be a topic of conversation among conspiracy theorists.\nCheck out these 5 Powerful Documentaries About Britney Spears\nKeanu Reeves has been a Hollywood staple for over three decades, but some people believe that the actor isn't just talented - he's also immortal. The theory suggests that Reeves is a part of a secret society that has existed for centuries and that he has been photographed in various historical events throughout time.\nSupporters of this theory point to the fact that Reeves hasn't aged much over the years and that his characters often have similarities in their appearance. While it's unlikely that Reeves is immortal, this theory is certainly an interesting one.\nOne of the craziest conspiracy theories circulating around Hollywood is that the Church of Scientology held auditions to find Tom Cruise's next wife.\nThe theory suggests that the church wanted someone who would be a good public face for the religion and that the \"winning\" candidate would have the opportunity to marry Cruise. The church has denied these claims, but the theory still persists.\nCheck out these 13 Shocking Documentaries About Scientology\nOne of the most popular celebrity conspiracy theories is that the moon landing was faked. The theory suggests that the government could not successfully accomplish the moon landing, so they hired the famous film director Stanley Kubrick to fake it.\nThe theory goes on to claim that Kubrick included secret messages in his films to reveal the truth. While there is no evidence to support this theory, it continues to be a topic of debate among conspiracy theorists.\nCheck out our podcast episode on Wonderful: Stories From the Space Station\nThe theory that Avril Lavigne died and was replaced by a lookalike surfaced in 2005, and since then, it has not faded away.

(Just me? OK.) Well, identical twin jokes aren't what we're going for with this article. No, we're referring to the celebrities whom conspiracy theories believe have either been cloned and/or are being impersonated.\nMany of these theories posit celebs have died and their replicas are walking among us. Disney's Alice better be thankful she never fell down this twisted rabbit hole. Check out these crazy theories below.\nYouTuber Kendall Rae talked about this insane theory in a video from October 2018.\nApparently, some people believe Post Malone and Justin Bieber are the same person. \"Why... how...,\" you ask? According to Kendall, \"If you pitch down a Justin Bieber song, it starts to sound like Post Malone, and if you pitch up a Post Malone song, it sounds like Justin Bieber.\"\nNot gonna lie, they do actually sound alike.\nOne day, Miley Cyrus is being cute, innocent Hannah Montana on Disney Channel. The next, she's grinding onstage and dancing ~provocatively~. According to one theory, Disney allegedly killed the starlet and dumped her body in the California desert after her rebellious streak went too far. Some people think she was either cloned or one of her background dancers (some say body double) is pretending to be her.\nEven more bizarre, one YouTube video claims Miley is a Draco Reptilian Shapeshifter Hybrid and that she blinks sideways.\nTheorists believe producers got ahold of some of Bey's stem cells back when she first started singing, knowing her talent would be such a waste if she died prematurely. Apparently, they claim Bey died in 2000 (though some think it was in 1999), making the Beyonc\u00e9 we know and love today a clone.\nZeena LaVey, aka Zeena Sch...[Content truncated]",
