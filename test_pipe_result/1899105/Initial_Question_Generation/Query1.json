I decided to go to the local Cici's Pizza because they offer an all-you-can-eat buffet. I stayed for around 45 minutes (around 4:15-5:00 P.M.) and ate 22 pieces of pizza. As I was about to try some pineapple/ham pizza that they just set out, the manager ran up to me and informed me that I had exceeded the max amount that you can eat at the buffet. What the hell? It's literally called an ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT BUFFET. I have heard of no such thing in my life. Maybe they shouldn't charge such a low price if they are going to get pissed off. Has anyone experienced something similar, or should I make a complaint? I don't want to seem like \"that one guy\" who files a lawsuit for false advertisement, but I mean... All-You-Can-Eat... :\\[\nRead more\nArchived post.

The manager refused and called police when they would not leave.\nThe couple said they have eaten at Chuck-A-Rama's $8.99 buffet at least twice a week, but did not plan to return.\n\\------------------------------------\nOkay, Chuck-A-Rama sure sounds like an all you can eat place to me. I guess I would want to know how...[Content truncated]",

(Photo: Pixabay)\nAlbert Flemming, from Massachusetts is suing Golden Corral Corporation for $2million for false advertising after he was thrown out of one of the chain’s restaurants by its employees.\nAccording to witnesses, the welfare recipient was expelled after he spent more than seven hours on site eating a whopping 50 pounds of food, alone.\nDespite advertising, an ‘all you can eat’ buffet, the manager seemingly lost patience at some point telling the now disgruntled customer that his meal would be free but he has to leave.\nThe manager’s intervention angered Flemming, and after a brief altercation between the two, he was thrown out of the establishment. Flemming went on to call the police and filed a complaint against the restaurant and says he will hold the employeed accountable for their actions.\nAs reported by the website 8Shit, Flemming told reporters that it was a serious injustice and he was deeply insulted.

                    "content": "clockThis article was published more than 5 years ago\nThe restaurant owner said the triathlete’s behavior was “not normal\"\nGerman triathlete Jaroslav Bobrowski knows how to get his money’s worth.\nA few nights ago, he went out to enjoy an all-you-can-eat buffet in Landshut, Germany. He follows a special diet, fasting for 20 hours at a stretch. So when he sat down to enjoy the $18.49 meal, he was ready to eat.\nAnd eat.\nAnd eat.\nIn a matter of minutes, Bobrowski polished off 100 plates of food. Eater estimates that he consumed as much as 18 pounds of sushi, or 4,000 calories.\nThe restaurant’s owner said that Bobrowski’s consumption was “not normal” and that he ate as much as five diners normally would. (He also declined to buy any booze, a blow to the restaurant’s bottom line.)\n\"I myself am dead after 13 plates, but he always took five or seven plates at a time,” said the owner, who gave his name as Tan, according the Local, a news website. “So there was a gap on the sushi carousel and the other guests asked if we had skimped on the fish. I want to win customers and not offend any guests. But ... we only earn money on the drinks and he only consumed one tea the whole evening.”\nThough Bobrowski was a regular, the owner called his meal out of line and banned him from dining in again.\n“When I went to the checkout, I wanted to tip, but the waiter did not want to accept that. I’m banned from now on because I’m eating too much. I was stunned,” Bobrowski told the Local.\nBobrowski, 30, is a former bodybuilder and Iron Man competitor. He works as a software engineer during the day. He has “less than 10 percent” body fat, according to the Local.\nHis exploits have made him something of a celebrity in Germany, where he has been nicknamed “sushi man.” Bobrowski has said that he feels bad for inconveniencing the restaurant, and he has promised to do better when he enjoys the buffet at China City, a nearby restaurant.\n“At the beginning, the owner has asked me to drink more,” Bobrowski told Bild. “I totally understand.”",

When he eats the pork trotters, he consumes the whole tray of them. And for prawns, usually people use tongs to pick them up, he uses a tray to take them all.\" \nHe added that he is banning all live-streamers from the restaurant. \nThe story is trending on Chinese social media and has racked up more than 250 million views on Weibo, with a wide-range of opinions. \nSome have said that the restaurant should not be an all-you-can-eat restaurant if they can't afford it, while others felt sorry for the restaurant owner. \nLast year the Chinese government started cracking down on eating influencers, and such videos may be banned altogether in the country.\nIt came after President Xi Jinping called on people to \"fight against food waste\" amid rising concerns over food shortages.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.
