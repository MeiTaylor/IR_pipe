My nearest location is in Waukesha, Wisconsin. (Old Country Buffet used to have free beverages but changed to it being extra fee. Those machines require regular care & maintenance and they let customers use them.)\nI know that if you are there for breakfast on Saturday or Sunday, you get free milk and juice. Get there at 10:30 am for a bit of breakfast. Then have some lunch with your milk.\nLet\u2019s see if I can look that up at their site. One page to try first is this one. Let\u2019s see if anyone has asked this question before.\nI don\u2019t see anything about beverages.\nHave you thought of calling your nearest Golden Corral to ask about current beverage costs? Generally they don\u2019t publish prices if it can change at any time. Some customers are stickler for posted prices. Better to just keep it on the menu board.\nThere is online ordering. That\u2019s the only way I\u2019d do it now. I like eating at home anyway with my own dinnerware and TV with Disney+.\nLet me see if I can find out by starting an order and see if I can add beverages. I found beverage listing. It says for my Waukesha location that the price for a single serve (for pick up) is:\nSingle Serve\n$2.79\nLarge 32 oz. To Go Cup\nIn store, you pay one price and you get refills.\nThat\u2019s about as close as I could get to getting you a price.\nWhat does it say for your location? Try that.\nA beverage at Golden Corral typically costs between $1.99 and $2.99, depending on the size and type of drink.",
