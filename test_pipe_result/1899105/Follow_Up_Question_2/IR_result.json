He goes on to say that with him limited income (he is on welfare) he rarely gets to eat out so he was trying to get his money’s worth.\nIf you’ve eaten the equivalent of a middle school student in buffet food, you’ve gotten your whole town’s money’s worth.\nI’m just glad our welfare system is working as intended and the people that really need the assistance are getting it… Sarcasm\n7 hours. I wonder if he had a game boy or something with him? Even if I strove to be the biggest, fattest slob I could, I think I’d get bored if it was just eating for 7 hours.The case will probably get thrown out, these kinds generally do. Especially since he wasn’t charged.\nErm, the all you can eat does not mean all you can eat fatso!! My wife worked for Old Country Buffet corporate and they do have a legal definition built into the All You Can Eat phrase. Managers were always asking customers to leave.\nWho the F#$^ can eat ...[Content truncated]"

    "QA": {
        "Question": "What specific actions did Golden Corral take against the man after his seven-hour visit that led to the lawsuit?",
        "Answer": "After the man's seven-hour visit to Golden Corral, the specific actions that led to the lawsuit included the following:\n\n1. **Expulsion from the Establishment**: Albert Flemming, the plaintiff, was ultimately expelled from the Golden Corral after he had consumed approximately 50 pounds of food during his lengthy stay. The management intervened and asked him to leave, citing a loss of patience regarding the duration of his visit at an all-you-can-eat buffet, which led to significant frustration on his part.\n\n2. **Manager's Remarks**: During the incident, the manager explicitly told Flemming that his meal would be complimentary, but that he must leave the premises. This statement further aggravated the situation and contributed to the altercation between Flemming and the staff. The encounter escalated to a point where he felt wronged and insulted, prompting him to take legal action against Golden Corral for what he described as false advertising regarding their buffet offer.\n\n3. **Call to Authorities**: After being thrown out, Flemming called the police and filed a complaint against the restaurant. This action indicates the extent of his dissatisfaction and the seriousness with which he viewed the treatment he received, leading him to seek accountability for the actions of the employees at Golden Corral.\n\nIn summary, Flemming's lawsuit stems from being asked to leave after exceeding a typical dining duration at a buffet, coupled with his perception of being treated unjustly despite the restaurant's advertised promise of an all-you-can-eat experience.",
