Clearly this guy was hungry.  \nMAN SUES GOLDEN CORRAL FOR 2 MILLION DOLLARS..WAIT TILL YOU HEAR WHY  \nA fifty one year old Springfield, Massachusetts man is suing Golden Corral because he bought the all you can eat buffet but was kicked out before he was finished. Despite the fact that they let him have what he ate for free, Mr Fleming (Or Mr Flemmings, name is uncertain) is suing them for 2 million dollars for false advertisement. Golden Corral offers an all you can eat buffet. Mr Fleming says that not only was he still hungry but:  \nâItâs a serious injustice, and I am deeply insulted!

Not only did they kick me out while I was still hungry, but they looked at me like I was disgusting, like I was not worthy of eating there! Itâs unacceptable, and I demand a compensation!â  \nBy now, you are probably wondering what you are missing. Mr Fleming had stayed at the buffet for over seven hours and consumed 50 to 70 pounds of food.  \n]  \nNormally, I would consider this an open and shut case as he purchased the lunch buffet which lasts only 5 1/2 hours and he was actually eating the supper buffet.

Filthy, nasty, children.\nOr really, because of their parents. Golden Coral had signs clearly stating that young children should be accompanied. But these Walmart-rejects send their little walking Petrie dishes up there alone anyways. How many times have I seen a kid try something on their plate, not like it, and scrape it back into the tray? How many times have I seen kids pick over cookies or brownies with their grubby hands? I even saw a kid double-dipping in the chocolate fountain!\nOn top of the uncouth behavior, there is another issue: height. The little ones stand below the sneeze guard. So even if they aren't sneezing or coughing on the food, they are talking over it, spraying it with spittle droplets. Disgusting.\nAbout the only time I will hit GC is right at opening, when the food is freshly served, and the mobile covid dispensers have not yet contaminated it.\nWhy are some people adamant about not eating at a buffet restaurant such as Golden Corral or even a Chinese buffet?\nIâmâ¦ that guy.\nI hate buffets.\nYes, I like being able to eat lots of different things, and in the amounts I want. But it all ends there.\nI like hot foods hot. Cold foods cold. Crispy foods crispy. Oysters that havenât laid there, dead and rotting.\nI like fresh, quality ingredients â not the leftovers that the restaurant needs to use up before they start to stink.\nI like food that hasnât been picked over by the hordes that got there before I did, all of whom Iâm certain were sneezing constantly.\nHate me yet? If not, donât worry. I can take it up a notch.\nCantonese cuisine is at the core of American Chinese cuisine. The fundamental principle is fresh ingredients, usually cooked quickly to maintain textures and flavors. So why would you take a sizzling hot stir fry, pour it into a serving dish, and leave it under heat lamps for hours while everything gets limp and soggy and the fat congeals?\nI would rather eat smaller quantities of good food, than stuff myself on cheap eats that I donât really enjoy but nonetheless congratulate myself on what a good deal I got...[Content truncated]",

(Photo: Pixabay)\nAlbert Flemming, from Massachusetts is suing Golden Corral Corporation for $2million for false advertising after he was thrown out of one of the chainâs restaurants by its employees.\nAccording to witnesses, the welfare recipient was expelled after he spent more than seven hours on site eating a whopping 50 pounds of food, alone.\nDespite advertising, an âall you can eatâ buffet, the manager seemingly lost patience at some point telling the now disgruntled customer that his meal would be free but he has to leave.\nThe managerâs intervention angered Flemming, and after a brief altercation between the two, he was thrown out of the establishment. Flemming went on to call the police and filed a complaint against the restaurant and says he will hold the employeed accountable for their actions.\nAs reported by the website 8Shit, Flemming told reporters that it was a serious injustice and he was deeply insulted.

Why don't people chain their kids to the damn table or something?

We were all on vacation in the same small town one summer, and in a neighboring town some twenty miles away, was a hotel whose restaurant featured a very nice, and pretty uncommon at the time, all-you-can-eat Sunday night buffet (as i recall, it included a prime rib roast, a ham, a turkey, fried fish and salads, vegetables. . .) . The cousin decided we all needed to go to dinner with him. So we did. . .and his appetite was more than prodigious: it was truly gargantuan. Over the course of the next couple hours, due almost entirely to his insatiable hunger, the entire buffet looked like it had been swarmed by locusts, with not much more left than some beet juice at the bottom of a serving dish, and his two stacks of emptied plates were each a foot high. He then had an entire pie for dessert. He talked about that wonderful dinner all the following week and insisted that we return the next Sunday for a repeat performance; and being irrepressible as well as insatiable, he dragged us back to the hotel. They, however, had learned: there was now a sign at the dining room entrance announcing that, for the rest of the summer season, the buffet was cancelled. Now, I donât know for sure if I actually saw this or imagined it, but I seem to recall, at the bottom of the sign, in red crayon, was written something like: âSome people ruin things for everyone else.â\nUpvote Â·\n9951\n94\n]\nLives in San Francisco Bay Area Â· Author has 61.6K answers and 80.5M answer views\nÂ Â·Â \nOriginally Answered:  Â·\nThe buffet may have posted rules.
