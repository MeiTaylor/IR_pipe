I explained to\nher (still laughing and having trouble getting out words) that I had a slight\naccident and needed her help. Knowing that I had experienced some close\ncalls in the past, she probably assumed that I had laid down a small turd\nor something and just needed to bring the car around so we could bolt immediately.\nUntil I asked her, I'm sure she had no idea that she was about to go across\nthe street and purchase me new underwear, new socks, new pants, a new shirt,\nand (by that time due to considerable leakage around the elastic ankles\nthingies) new sneakers.

At that moment, I think it dawned on him exactly\nthe gravity of the situation. Then that manager went so far above the call\nof duty that I will be eternally grateful for his actions. He hooked up\na hose.\nFortunately, commercial bathrooms are constructed with tile walls and\ntile floors and have a drain in the middle of the room in order to make\nclean up easy. Fortunately, I was in a commercial bathroom. He hooked up\nthe hose to the spigot located under the sink as I began cleaning myself\nup with the wet towels. Just as I was finishing, my wife got back with the\nnew clothes and passed them into the stall, whereupon I stuffed the previously\nworn clothing into the plastic bag that came from the store, handing the\nbag to my wife.
