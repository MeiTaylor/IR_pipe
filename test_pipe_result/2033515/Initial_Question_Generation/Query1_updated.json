The clothing Sanders is wearing on the floor in the recently discovered contact sheets looks to be the same as the clothing the young man is wearing in the photo in question. \nMoreover, Lyon said that based on their order on the contact sheets, the newly discovered pictures of Sanders were taken immediately after the disputed photo.\n\u201cI\u2019m deducing it by looking at the other photos on the contact sheets. Contact sheets are like evidence,\u201d Lyon said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that that person standing there is Bernie Sanders.\u201d\nBy the early afternoon on Saturday, the University of Chicago archives had changed the caption to identify the man as Sanders.

January, 1962. \u00a9 Danny Lyon | Magnum Photos\n_In light of the ongoing US Democratic Presidential Primary, we look back upon Danny Lyon\u2019s documentation of the civil rights movement during the \u201860s, and specifically his images of a young Bernie Sanders \u2013 now Democratic presidential candidate \u2013 and his role in student activism at the University of Chicago\u2019s Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) sit-in. The images gained national attention during the 2016 Presidential Primary when certain news outlets disputed the claim that Sanders was part of the protest at all. We spoke with Danny Lyon about his work as a campus photographer, his documentation of student activism and the much-debated protest pictures._\nDanny Lyon, now one of the most renowned photographers of the civil rights movement in the American South, began his career as an on-campus photographer at the University of Chicago, where he enrolled in 1960. While studying and working, Lyon would also undertake personal photographic projects in his free time: by February 1962, the photographer had made four trips to the Deep South as a civil rights activist, working as a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). In that same month he also participated in what is considered to have been the first sit-in to occur in the north of the country \u2014 at his own school, the University of Chicago. Organized by the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), the demonstration was staged in opposition to the university\u2019s segregated campus housing policy. One of the leaders of the sit-in was 20-year old Bernie Sanders.\n]\nDanny Lyon Bernie Sanders (left) and other CORE activists during a sit-in at...[Content truncated]",

(Stark can be seen seated in the far right of the photo. He is the African-American man with the hair part.) \u201cThe way he\u2019s holding the book there and his left hand\u2014that was a Bruce gesture, and the hair,\u201d said Stark, who was well-aquatinted with Sanders and now supports his presidential bid. \u201cMy reaction is yes, that looks like Bruce.\u201d\nTwo other alumni, Sally Cook, class of 1966, and Robin Kaufman, class of 1965, also said they believed the photo showed Rappaport. Since the image does not show the man\u2019s face, the alumni conceded that it was difficult to say for certain the man is not Sanders.\nThere is no question that Sanders, who has so far largely failed to attract black supporters of his candidacy, was deeply involved in civil rights activism at the University of Chicago, including the sit-in depicted in the photo, a protest of the university\u2019s segregated housing practices. Sanders gave speeches in the freezing Chicago winter and was arrested by the police. He also demonstrated for desegregated schools in the city of Chicago, and participated in Dr. Martin Luther King\u2019s march on Washington in 1963.\nOn Thursday, a Sanders spokesman said the candidate was sure he was the person in the photo. \u201cI showed Bernie the picture again. That\u2019s him. He remembers Bruce Rappaport,\u201d wrote spokesman Michael Briggs in an email. Hours later, a Sanders senior adviser said the campaign would investigate further. \u201cThis is the first we\u2019ve heard of it. As we sit here right now I still think that\u2019s Bernie. But we\u2019ll take a look at it,\u201d said strategist Tad Devine. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt as to his participation in all of this. We\u2019ll just confirm the visual.\u201d\nRead more: The Radical Education of Bernie Sanders\nAnother photo in the University of Chicago archives shows Sanders standing next to the school\u2019s president, George Beadle, at around the same time.

Because he made his remarks at a press conference announcing the Congressional Black Caucus PAC\u2019s endorsement of Sanders\u2019 opponent, Hillary Clinton, Lewis\u2019 comments can be seen as a mild dig at Sanders. (In the same breath he said he _had_ met Bill and Hillary Clinton.)\nBut it\u2019s also undoubtedly true.\nThe Georgia congressman was a titan of the civil rights movement. A participant in the Freedom Rides organized by the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), he went on to lead the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and still bears the scars he received at Selma. Sanders\u2019 involvement was, by comparison, brief and localized, his sacrifices limited to one arrest for protesting and a bad GPA from neglecting his studies. But Sanders was, in his own right, an active participant in the movement during his three years at the University of Chicago.\nAlthough Sanders did attend the 1963 March on Washington, at which Lewis spoke, most of his work was in and around Hyde Park, where he became involved with the campus chapter of CORE shortly after transferring from Brooklyn College in 1961. During Sanders\u2019 first year in Chicago, a group of apartment-hunting white and black students had discovered that off-campus buildings owned by the university were refusing to rent to black students, in violation of the school\u2019s policies. CORE organized a 15-day sit-in at the administration building...[Content truncated]",

Three major news organizations have used a photograph I made of Bernie Sanders as a twenty year old student at the University of Chicago to attack his campaign and to denigrate his early place in history.\n!Danny at the SNCC headquarters, July 1962.\nIn 1962, a few months after\u00a0I made the pictures of Bernie as an early civil rights\u00a0 activist, I made another picture of\u00a0 another young man sitting quietly in the back of a church in Cairo, Illinois. I have published that in my book, Memories of the Southern Civil Rights Movement. I knew who John Lewis was when I saw him\u00a0 that morning because of his unparalleled bravery as a freedom rider. The year before we met, the Freedom Rides had made John Lewis a hero to all young, caring and politically engaged students. I was one of them, and I\u2019m sure Bernie was another. It was 1962, over fifty-three years ago.\n!My picture and poster of John Lewis in Cairo, Illinois.\nBernie chose to organize in the North. I went south. I became the principle photographer of the southern civil rights movement, John Lewis\u2019s roommate in Atlanta, and a paid staff member of the SNCC.\u00a0 In 1962 there were very few white northerners that went south. In many ways SNCC did not want them to come. Integrated groups in the deep South seemed to incite violence....[Content truncated]",

As Jaffe reports in his 2015 book _Why Bernie Sanders Matters_, the future senator attempted to convince his Milton Friedmanite freshman roommate David Reiter \u201cthat capitalism was a failed system that oppressed the majority.\u201d Reiter recounted to Jaffe, \u201c\\ was so sad that I just couldn\u2019t understand what was wrong with the free market. It was more in sorrow than in anger.\u201d\nSanders elaborated on his reasons for joining the socialists in Chicago during a 2016  with MSNBC host Chris Matthews at UChicago. \u201cWhat it was to me was trying to connect the dots,\u201d Sanders told Matthews. \u201cTo understand what money and power was about, the impact that it had on society. Why it was that we had so much \u2014 and it\u2019s worse today than we had then \u2014 income and wealth inequality.\u201d\nDuring his time in Chicago, Sanders also briefly organized with the , a position that introduced him to the trade union movement.\nThese experiences didn\u2019t just open Sanders\u2019 eyes to the injustice at the heart of America\u2019s economic system. They helped forge a political identity that would color his life from that point on \u2014 one which sees workers of all races and backgrounds pitted against those who control capital and seek to keep the current order in place.\nIt\u2019s fitting that Sanders is returning to Chicago as a longtime nemesis of his and his politics is on the way out.\nIn September 2018, Rahm Emanuel announced he wouldn\u2019t seek a third term as Chicago mayor. Following a time in office evinced by brutal austerity, corruption, privatization, segregated gun violence, and rampant police abuse, Emanuel \u2014 the one-time prized beacon of Third Way, Democratic centrism \u2014 has seen his political career in Chicago come to an abrupt halt.\nIn March 2016, ahead of the Illinois primary, Sanders made his views on Emanuel explicit: \u201cLet me be as clear as I can be: Based on his disastrous record as mayor of the city of Chicago, I do not want Mayor Emanuel\u2019s endorsement if I win the Democratic nomination.\u201d\nSanders\u2019 entry into the 2020 race shows him continuing his career-long maneuver of railing against a wealthy ruling elite while calling on his supporters to join a mass movement to challenge economic and racial inequality.

(Danny Lyon/Magnum Photos via AP)\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Bernie Sanders was in his first year at the University of Chicago, 20 and with a thick New York accent when he took to the steps of the administration building to rail against a university policy of racially segregated housing.\n\u201cWe feel it is an intolerable situation, when Negro and white students of the university cannot live together in university-owned apartments,\u201d Sanders told a crowd of about 200 students that afternoon in January 1962. Then he and a few dozen students headed to the fifth floor, where they began a 15-day sit-in outside the university president\u2019s office, passing their time reading and eating dinners of donated cheese and salami sandwiches.\nAs Sanders and fellow Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton jockey for support from black and Latino voters ahead of Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary, much of the debate has centered around which candidate has a stronger record of fighting for minorities. The issue could be especially important in South Carolina, where black voters form a majority of the Democratic electorate. In their last primary contest, in Nevada, a large majority of blacks supported Clinton amid questions about Sanders\u2019s early commitment...[Content truncated]",

In the mid-1960s, Chicago became the most important test case for implementing civil-rights legislation prohibiting school segregation.[1]\nGordon Quinn, founder of Kartemquin Films, the studio best known for \u201cHoop Dreams\u201d (1994), (filmed) the protests while a student at the University of Chicago. He turned the resulting footage into the 2017 documentary \u201c\u201963 Boycott.\u201d The film connects the forgotten story of one of the largest Northern civil rights demonstrations to contemporary issues around race, education, and youth activism.[2]\nWhen asked about Bernie\u2019s role in civil rights during the 2016 presidential campaign, Quinn noted, \u201cOne hundred and sixty-nine people had been arrested in the summer of \u201963, and four people were charged, and one of them was Bernard Sanders\u2026For a lot of people, Bernie is a tough sell. Not for us. He\u2019s saying all the things we believe in.\u201d[1] Expressing appreciation that voters were debating the civil-rights records of 2016 candidates, Quinn said that \u201cmore people now recognize that civil-rights activists were organized, creative, and persistent in the North as well as the South. More importantly, the history of civil rights and school segregation in Chicago, of which Sanders\u2019s 1963 arrest is a part, makes it clear how far America must still travel to achieve equality.\u201d[1]\nWhen Martin Luther King, Jr. visited Chicago a few years after the \u201963 protests, he responded to a young radio caller who questioned whether her participation in the demonstrations and subsequent arrest had even made a difference because she could not see it.\nDr. King replied:\n\u201cThe movement itself created an atmosphere which finally led to the removal of Mr. Willis. So that in itself was an accomplishment. Often you are accomplishing much more than you can see at the moment because you are in the heart of the situation. But those of us who were not here last summer and who happen to be here now see that a great deal was accomplished. And many of the things we are able to do now\u2026(are) because the atmosphere was created last summer for the building of a vibrant movement to end discrimination, injustice, slums\u2026 in the city of Chicago.\u201d[3]\n\n                                        The Bernie Sanders Almanac                                    \nJanuary 23, 1962\n\n                                        The Bernie Sanders Almanac                                    \nOctober 23, 1971\nShare:\nBy providing your cell phone number you agree to receive periodic updates.
