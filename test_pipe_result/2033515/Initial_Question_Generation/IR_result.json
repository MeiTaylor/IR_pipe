(Stark can be seen seated in the far right of the photo. He is the African-American man with the hair part.) “The way he’s holding the book there and his left hand—that was a Bruce gesture, and the hair,” said Stark, who was well-aquatinted with Sanders and now supports his presidential bid. “My reaction is yes, that looks like Bruce.”\nTwo other alumni, Sally Cook, class of 1966, and Robin Kaufman, class of 1965, also said they believed the photo showed Rappaport. Since the image does not show the man’s face, the alumni conceded that it was difficult to say for certain the man is not Sanders.\nThere is no question that Sanders, who has so far largely failed to attract black supporters of his candidacy, was deeply involved in civil rights activism at the University of Chicago, including the sit-in depicted in the photo, a protest of the university’s segregated housing practices. Sanders gave speeches in the freezing Chicago winter and was arrested by the police. He also demonstrated for desegregated schools in the city of Chicago, and participated in Dr. Martin Luther King’s march on Washington in 1963.\nOn Thursday, a Sanders spokesman said the candidate was sure he was the person in the photo. “I showed Bernie the picture again. That’s him. He remembers Bruce Rappaport,” wrote spokesman Michael Briggs in an email. Hours later, a Sanders senior adviser said the campaign would investigate further. “This is the first we’ve heard of it. As we sit here right now I still think that’s Bernie. But we’ll take a look at it,” said strategist Tad Devine. “There’s no doubt as to his participation in all of this. We’ll just confirm the visual.”\nRead more: The Radical Education of Bernie Sanders\nAnother photo in the University of Chicago archives shows Sanders standing next to the school’s president, George Beadle, at around the same time.

He was despised in the Black community for deploying the wagons (trailers) to school parking lots and playgrounds on Chicago’s South and West sides as overflow space for Black students. The Black community called attention to the fact that the trailers were in place to keep Black students out of white schools – some of which were underpopulated. The racial segregation and inequality boycott saw over 200,000 students, primarily Black, stay home from school.\nThe ’63 protest in which he participated was part of a decade of civil-rights activism designed to force Chicago to address school segregation in the city. The demonstrations escalated in 1963 and included a massive “Freedom Day” school boycott organized by the Coordinating Council of Community Organizations (CCCO), a civil-rights coalition including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Urban League, Black and White parents, and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), the organization with which Sanders was affiliated.[1]\n(Bernie’s) arrest is a window into the civil rights movement in the North and highlights a little-known turning point in the history of civil rights and education equality.

As a teenager, he read Karl Marx, and as a college student he organized sit-ins against segregation, worked for a union, protested police brutality and attended the 1963 March on Washington. Throughout that time, the central theme of his life has never wavered. “We were concerned obviously about economic injustice,” says Sanders of his college days. “And we were concerned with the question, ‘How do you make change?’”\nSanders’ education in socialism began at home, in a three-and-a-half room apartment in Flatbush, Brooklyn. His father was a paint salesman from Poland and a high school dropout, and the family lived paycheck-to-paycheck. When Sanders’ father went with his wife to see the play The Death of a Salesman, his father so identified with the underemployed Willy Loman that he broke down in tears. “The lack of money caused stress in my family and fights between my mother and father,” Sanders explained to TIME in an interview this month. “That is a reality I have never forgotten: today, there are many millions of families who are living under the circumstances that we lived under.”\nBernie’s older brother, Larry, was a student at Brooklyn College who would come home and discuss Marx and Freud with the high school kid. They talked about democracy in ancient Greece, and Larry took the young Bernie to local Democratic Party meetings. Bernie followed his older brother to Brooklyn College, but when his mother died unexpectedly young, he left Brooklyn and transferred to the University of Chicago.\nIn Chicago, Sanders threw himself into activism—civil rights, economic justice, volunteering, organizing. “I received more of an education off campus than I did in the classroom,” Sanders says. By his 23rd birthday, Sanders had worked for a meatpackers union, marched for civil rights in Washington D.C., joined the university socialists and been arrested at a civil rights demonstration. He delivered jeremiads to young crowds. The police called him an outside agitator, Sanders said. He was a sloppy student, and the dean asked him to take a year off. He inspired his classmates. “He knows how to talk to people now,” said Robin Kaufman, a student who knew Sanders in 1960s Chicago, “and he knew how to do it then.” He was a radical before it was cool.\n\nHe also met regularly with the Young Peoples Socialist League in the student center, where students talked about nuclear disarmament, former Socialist Party Presidential candidate Eugene V....[Content truncated]",

(Stark can be seen seated in the far right of the photo. He is the African-American man with the hair part.) “The way he’s holding the book there and his left hand—that was a Bruce gesture, and the hair,” said Stark, who was well-aquatinted with Sanders and now supports his presidential bid. “My reaction is yes, that looks like Bruce.”\nTwo other alumni, Sally Cook, class of 1966, and Robin Kaufman, class of 1965, also said they believed the photo showed Rappaport. Since the image does not show the man’s face, the alumni conceded that it was difficult to say for certain the man is not Sanders.\nThere is no question that Sanders, who has so far largely failed to attract black supporters of his candidacy, was deeply involved in civil rights activism at the University of Chicago, including the sit-in depicted in the photo, a protest of the university’s segregated housing practices. Sanders gave speeches in the freezing Chicago winter and was arrested by the police. He also demonstrated for desegregated schools in the city of Chicago, and participated in Dr. Martin Luther King’s march on Washington in 1963.\nOn Thursday, a Sanders spokesman said the candidate was sure he was the person in the photo. “I showed Bernie the picture again. That’s him. He remembers Bruce Rappaport,” wrote spokesman Michael Briggs in an email. Hours later, a Sanders senior adviser said the campaign would investigate further. “This is the first we’ve heard of it. As we sit here right now I still think that’s Bernie. But we’ll take a look at it,” said strategist Tad Devine. “There’s no doubt as to his participation in all of this. We’ll just confirm the visual.”\nRead more: The Radical Education of Bernie Sanders\nAnother photo in the University of Chicago archives shows Sanders standing next to the school’s president, George Beadle, at around the same time.

        "Question": "Does the video confirm Bernie Sanders' participation in a 1962 civil rights sit-in with evidence?",
        "Answer": "The video does not provide direct confirmation of Bernie Sanders' participation in a 1962 civil rights sit-in; however, it references relevant historical context and evidence supporting his involvement. There are historical records and photographs that suggest Sanders was indeed active in civil rights protests at the University of Chicago in 1962, specifically related to housing segregation, though the video itself does not provide visual evidence of this sit-in. Credible sources confirm that Bernie Sanders was part of a sit-in organized by the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) which protested against segregated housing at the University of Chicago in January 1962. For instance, photographer Danny Lyon, who documented this sit-in, affirmed that it was Sanders leading this protest and emphasized that the disputed photo includes Sanders. Furthermore, extensive discussion around the 1962 photograph of a young man leading the sit-in has been tied back to Sanders, with new evidence recently suggesting the identity of that individual is indeed him. It is also noted in various sources that while there has been debate about the individual in specific photos, there is no question regarding Sanders' participation in civil rights activism during that time. Reports confirm that Sanders engaged in protests and was arrested for civil rights causes. Overall, while the video does not provide direct evidence itself, it aligns with and references the historical facts surrounding Sanders' involvement in civil rights activism during the early 1960s.",
