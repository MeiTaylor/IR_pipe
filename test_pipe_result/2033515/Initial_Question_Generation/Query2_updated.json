Who you are and what you do, what you fought for, and who and what you fought against, is always relevant. Twenty and thirty and forty years from now, when people step up to lead, and run for office, what they did and where they were during the Black Lives Matter Movement will mean something. If what Bernie did in the sixties doesn\u2019t matter now, then what you are doing right now doesn\u2019t matter. But you and I know it does.\nDr. King once said, \u201cThe ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.\u201d\nJust a teenager, Bernie Sanders moved from his hometown of Brooklyn to Chicago at the height of the Civil Rights Movement. It was the most tumultuous and challenging time this nation had faced since the Civil War a hundred years earlier.\nAnd most Americans, particularly most white Americans, remained silent. It was that silence, in the face of lynching, in the face of water hoses, in the face of bombings of homes and churches, in the face of assassinations, in the face of attack dogs being released on children, it was white silence that broke the heart of Dr. King as he languished in a Birmingham jail (read his letter here). It was that silence that he found told us more about the soul of America than the brutality and evil of this place.\nBernie loved Dr. King. And long before we used the phrase, Bernie had the notion that he needed to use his own white privilege to fight back against racism and bigotry and oppression and inequality. And that desire to hold this country to a higher standard began to well up in Bernie as a young student at the University of Chicago. He became the chairman of the university chapter of the Congress for Racial Equality (CORE) and merged the group with SNCC \u2014 the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee. Bernie literally helped lead the first known sit-in in at the University...[Content truncated]",

He was despised in the Black community for deploying the wagons (trailers) to school parking lots and playgrounds on Chicago\u2019s South and West sides as overflow space for Black students. The Black community called attention to the fact that the trailers were in place to keep Black students out of white schools \u2013 some of which were underpopulated. The racial segregation and inequality boycott saw over 200,000 students, primarily Black, stay home from school.\nThe \u201963 protest in which he participated was part of a decade of civil-rights activism designed to force Chicago to address school segregation in the city. The demonstrations escalated in 1963 and included a massive \u201cFreedom Day\u201d school boycott organized by the Coordinating Council of Community Organizations (CCCO), a civil-rights coalition including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Urban League, Black and White parents, and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), the organization with which Sanders was affiliated.[1]\n(Bernie\u2019s) arrest is a window into the civil rights movement in the North and highlights a little-known turning point in the history of civil rights and education equality. The fights over segregation in Chicago are not as well known as the battles in Little Rock or Selma. In the mid-1960s, Chicago became the most important test case for implementing civil-rights legislation prohibiting school segregation.[1]\nGordon Quinn, founder of Kartemquin Films, the studio best known for \u201cHoop Dreams\u201d (1994), (filmed) the protests while a student at the University of Chicago. He turned the resulting footage into the 2017 documentary \u201c\u201963 Boycott.\u201d The film connects the forgotten story of one of the largest Northern civil rights...[Content truncated]",

Sanders is the longest-serving independent in U.S. congressional history but has a close relationship with the Democratic Party, having caucused with House and Senate Democrats for most of his congressional career and sought the party's presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020, coming second in both campaigns. He is often seen as the leader of the U.S. progressive movement.\n\nBorn into a working-class Jewish family and raised in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, Sanders attended Brooklyn College before graduating from the University of Chicago in 1964. While a student, he was a protest organizer for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) during the civil rights movement. After settling in Vermont in 1968, he ran unsuccessful third-party political campaigns in the early to mid-1970s. He was elected mayor of Burlington in 1981 as an independent and was reelected three times. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990, representing Vermont's at-large congressional district, later co-founding the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He was a U.S. representative for 16 years before being elected to the U.S. Senate in...[Content truncated]",

Because he made his remarks at a press conference announcing the Congressional Black Caucus PAC\u2019s endorsement of Sanders\u2019 opponent, Hillary Clinton, Lewis\u2019 comments can be seen as a mild dig at Sanders. (In the same breath he said he _had_ met Bill and Hillary Clinton.)\nBut it\u2019s also undoubtedly true.\nThe Georgia congressman was a titan of the civil rights movement. A participant in the Freedom Rides organized by the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), he went on to lead the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and still bears the scars he received at Selma. Sanders\u2019 involvement was, by comparison, brief and localized, his sacrifices limited to one arrest for protesting and a bad GPA from neglecting his studies. But Sanders was, in his own right, an active participant in the movement during his three years at the University of Chicago.\nAlthough Sanders did attend the 1963 March on Washington, at which Lewis spoke, most of his work was in and around Hyde Park, where he became involved with the campus chapter of CORE shortly after transferring from Brooklyn College in 1961.

It looks, sounds and feels different. Black Lives Matter is a motley-looking group to this septuagenarian grandmother,\u00a0an activist in the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Many in my crowd admire the cause and courage of these young activists but fundamentally disagree with their approach. \u00a0Trained in the tradition of Martin Luther King Jr., we were nonviolent activists who won hearts by conveying respectability and changed laws by delivering a message of love and unity. BLM seems intent on rejecting our proven methods. This movement is ignoring what our history has taught.\nThe baby boomers who drove the success of the civil rights movement want to get behind Black Lives Matter, but the group\u2019s confrontational and divisive tactics make it difficult. In the 1960s, activists\u00a0confronted white mobs and police with dignity and decorum, sometimes dressing in church clothes and kneeling in prayer during protests to make a clear distinction between who was evil and who was good.\nBut at protests today, it is difficult to distinguish legitimate activists from the mob actors who burn and loot. The demonstrations are peppered with hate speech, profanity, and guys with\u00a0sagging pants that show their underwear. Even if the BLM activists aren\u2019t the ones participating in the boorish language and dress, neither are they condemning it.\nThe 1960s movement also had an innate respectability because our leaders often were heads of the black church, as well. Unfortunately, church and spirituality are not high priorities for Black Lives Matter, and the ethics of love, forgiveness and reconciliation that empowered black leaders such as King and Nelson Mandela in their successful quests to win over their oppressors are missing from this movement. The power of the spiritual approach was evident recently in the...[Content truncated]",

As a teenager, he read Karl Marx, and as a college student he organized sit-ins against segregation, worked for a union, protested police brutality and attended the 1963 March on Washington. Throughout that time, the central theme of his life has never wavered. \u201cWe were concerned obviously about economic injustice,\u201d says Sanders of his college days. \u201cAnd we were concerned with the question, \u2018How do you make change?\u2019\u201d\nSanders\u2019 education in socialism began at home, in a three-and-a-half room apartment in Flatbush, Brooklyn. His father was a paint salesman from Poland and a high school dropout, and the family lived paycheck-to-paycheck. When Sanders\u2019 father went with his wife to see the play The Death of a Salesman, his father so identified with the underemployed Willy Loman that he broke down in tears. \u201cThe lack of money caused stress in my family and fights between my mother and father,\u201d Sanders explained to TIME in an interview this month. \u201cThat is a reality I have never forgotten: today, there are many millions of families who are living under the circumstances that we lived under.\u201d\nBernie\u2019s older brother, Larry, was a student at Brooklyn College who would come home and discuss Marx and Freud with the high school kid. They talked about democracy in ancient Greece, and Larry took the young Bernie to local Democratic Party meetings. Bernie followed his older brother to Brooklyn College, but when his mother died unexpectedly young, he left Brooklyn and transferred to the University of Chicago.\nIn Chicago, Sanders threw himself into activism\u2014civil rights, economic justice, volunteering, organizing. \u201cI received more of an education off campus than I did in the classroom,\u201d Sanders says. By his 23rd birthday, Sanders had worked for a meatpackers union, marched for civil rights in Washington D.C., joined the university socialists and been arrested at a civil rights demonstration. He delivered jeremiads to young crowds. The police called him an outside agitator, Sanders said. He was a sloppy student, and the dean asked him to take a year off. He inspired his classmates. \u201cHe knows how to talk to people now,\u201d said Robin Kaufman, a student who knew Sanders in 1960s Chicago, \u201cand he knew how to do it then.\u201d He was a radical before it was cool.\n\nHe also met regularly with the Young Peoples Socialist League in the student center, where students talked about nuclear disarmament, former Socialist Party Presidential candidate Eugene V....[Content truncated]",

Economists estimate that if we do not take action, we will lose $34.5 trillion in economic activity by the end of the century. And the benefits are enormous: by taking bold and decisive action, we will save $2.9 trillion over 10 years, $21 trillion over 30 years, and $70.4 trillion over 80 years.\nWe cannot accomplish any of these goals without taking on the fossil fuel billionaires whose greed lies at the very heart of the climate crisis. These executives have spent hundreds of millions of dollars protecting their profits at the expense of our future, and they will do whatever it takes to squeeze every last penny out of the Earth. **Bernie promises to go further than any other presidential candidate in history to end the fossil fuel industry\u2019s greed,** including by making the industry pay for its pollution and prosecuting it for the damage it has caused.\n**And most importantly, we must build an unprecedented grassroots movement that is powerful enough to take them on, and win.** Young people, advocates, tribes, cities and states all over this country have already begun this important work, and we will continue to follow their lead.\n### **1) Transform Our Energy System to 100 Percent Renewable Energy and Create 20 Million Jobs**\nThere is no reason the United States, the wealthiest country in the history of the world, cannot transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to 100 percent renewable energy, like wind, solar, and geothermal. We have more than enough capacity to produce ample reliable, affordable electricity from sustainable resources. We must pass a Green New Deal to achieve **100 percent sustainable energy for electricity and transportation by no later than 2030 and to fully decarbonize the economy by 2050 at the latest.**\nThe federal government electrified America as part of the New Deal. The United States of America put people on the moon 50 years ago. We can sure as hell transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to 100 percent renewables today and create millions of jobs in the process.\nWhen Bernie is president, we will act immediately to address our climate crisis. Together, we will reduce US carbon pollution emissions by 71 percent and emissions among less industrialized countries by 36 percent from 2017 levels by 2030, consistent with meeting our fair share of emissions reductions under the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s recommendations. These emissions reductions represent the equivalent of reducing US emissions by 161 percent. This effort will be enforced by an interagency council led by Environmental Protection Agency.\n#### _As president, Bernie will:...[Content truncated]",
