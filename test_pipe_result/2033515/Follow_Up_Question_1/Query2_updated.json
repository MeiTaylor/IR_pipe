By the summer of 1962 I had taken my\u00a0camera\u00a0 into the deep South, and become the first photographer for SNCC.\n!\nIn January of 1962,\u00a0\u00a0at the University of Chicago, there was a sit-in inside the administration building protesting discrimination against blacks in university owned housing.\u00a0I went to it with a CORE activist and friend. The sit in was in a crowded hallway, blocking the entrance to the office of Dr. George Beadle, the chancellor.\n!\nI took the photograph of Bernie Sanders speaking to his fellow CORE members at that sit-in. Bob McNamara, a close friend and CORE activist, is in the very corner next to me in the picture. Across the room from me is another campus photographer named Wexler, who taught me how to develop film. I photographed Bernie a second time after he got a haircut, as he appeared next to the noble laureate and chancellor Dr. George Beadle. Time Magazine is now claiming it is not Bernie in the picture but someone else. It is Bernie, and it is proof of his very early dedication to justice for African Americans. The CORE sit-in that Bernie helped lead was the first civil rights sit-in to take place in\u00a0 the North.\n### Share this:\n*   \n*   \n*   \n### _Related_\nFiled under ,  \u00b7 Tagged with , , , , , , , , \n##### Comments\n**11 Responses to \u201cBernie Sanders Leads 1962\u00a0Sit-in\u201d**\n1.

(Stark can be seen seated in the far right of the photo. He is the African-American man with the hair part.) \u201cThe way he\u2019s holding the book there and his left hand\u2014that was a Bruce gesture, and the hair,\u201d said Stark, who was well-aquatinted with Sanders and now supports his presidential bid. \u201cMy reaction is yes, that looks like Bruce.\u201d\nTwo other alumni, Sally Cook, class of 1966, and Robin Kaufman, class of 1965, also said they believed the photo showed Rappaport. Since the image does not show the man\u2019s face, the alumni conceded that it was difficult to say for certain the man is not Sanders.\nThere is no question that Sanders, who has so far largely failed to attract black supporters of his candidacy, was deeply involved in civil rights activism at the University of Chicago, including the sit-in depicted in the photo, a protest of the university\u2019s segregated housing practices. Sanders gave speeches in the freezing Chicago winter and was arrested by the police. He also demonstrated for desegregated schools in the city of Chicago, and participated in Dr. Martin Luther King\u2019s march on Washington in 1963.\nOn Thursday, a Sanders spokesman said the candidate was sure he was the person in the photo. \u201cI showed Bernie the picture again. That\u2019s him. He remembers Bruce Rappaport,\u201d wrote spokesman Michael Briggs in an email. Hours later, a Sanders senior adviser said the campaign would investigate further. \u201cThis is the first we\u2019ve heard of it. As we sit here right now I still think that\u2019s Bernie. But we\u2019ll take a look at it,\u201d said strategist Tad Devine. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt as to his participation in all of this. We\u2019ll just confirm the visual.\u201d\nRead more: The Radical Education of Bernie Sanders\nAnother photo in the University of Chicago archives shows Sanders standing next to the school\u2019s president, George Beadle, at around the same time.

Sanders is the longest-serving independent in U.S. congressional history but has a close relationship with the Democratic Party, having caucused with House and Senate Democrats for most of his congressional career and sought the party's presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020, coming second in both campaigns. He is often seen as the leader of the U.S. progressive movement.\n\nBorn into a working-class Jewish family and raised in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, Sanders attended Brooklyn College before graduating from the University of Chicago in 1964. While a student, he was a protest organizer for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) during the civil rights movement. After settling in Vermont in 1968, he ran unsuccessful third-party political campaigns in the early to mid-1970s. He was elected mayor of Burlington in 1981 as an independent and was reelected three times. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990, representing Vermont's at-large congressional district, later co-founding the Congressional Progressive Caucus.

The clothing Sanders is wearing on the floor in the recently discovered contact sheets looks to be the same as the clothing the young man is wearing in the photo in question. \nMoreover, Lyon said that based on their order on the contact sheets, the newly discovered pictures of Sanders were taken immediately after the disputed photo.\n\u201cI\u2019m deducing it by looking at the other photos on the contact sheets.

Sanders, who identifies as Jewish himself, has also voiced support for the  that began on college campuses in April to show solidarity for the Palestinians under Israel\u2019s siege.\nThe wave of protests engulfed university life in the US and highlighted generational divides within the Democratic Party over support for Israel.

But, please, do not insult the intelligence of the American people by attempting to distract us from the immoral and illegal war policies of your extremist and racist government,\u201d Sanders wrote in a  on April 25.\n\u201cIt is not anti-Semitic to hold you accountable for your actions.\u201d\n> In 1962, we organized sit-ins to end racist policies at the University of Chicago.

And third, the belief that democracy was absolutely essential to socialism. Mike came to think of himself as a revolutionary socialist, and these three principles would be recurring themes of his life\u2019s activity.\nParker became the national secretary, the top officer, of the Student Peace Union and encouraged other YPSL members to join. The SPU organized against the development of nuclear arms, with the slogan, \u201cNo Test! East or West!\u201d that is, no testing either by the United States or the Soviet Union. That slogan reflected the YPSL\u2019s \u201cThird Camp\u201d socialist position, that is opposition to both capitalism and to the totalitarian Communist social systems. SPU argued that it would take a mass movement to force an end to nuclear testing and the elimination of nuclear arms. As one of its national leaders and its principal organizer, Mike succeeded in building an organization that by 1962 had 5,000 members, making it the largest leftist movement in the country at the time. At the same time, Mike also helped to recruit the leading members of the SPU to the YPSL. It was also in 1962 that Mike and fellow YPSL comrade Bernie Sanders were arrested during a civil rights demonstration.\nJust about that time a struggle between two factions broke out within the YPSL over the question of political action. Michael Harrington and the \u201crealignment tendency\u201d argued for work in the Democratic Party, believing that the civil rights movement and the progressive labor leaders like Walter Reuther of the United Auto Workers could \u201crealign\u201d the Democrats and transform them into a working-class party. Mike Parker and his political partner Joel Geier argued that workers needed their own party, a labor party. The labor party tendency had a strong base in the SPU, so Harrington and the realignment group tried to organize a merger between the SPU and the larger and more moderate National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy (SANE). Parker defeated the merger, but by then it hardly mattered. After the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 and then the 1963 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the SPU went into decline, as did YPSL, both consumed by the intense faction fight between the realignment and labor party tendencies. But by then, everything was changing: the Vietnam War had begun to become a national issue, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) had begun to grow rapidly, and the New Left was emerging.\nThe Free Speech Movement and the Peace and Freedom Party\nMike Parker and his friend Geier, both of whom had been students at the University of Chicago, now moved...[Content truncated]",
