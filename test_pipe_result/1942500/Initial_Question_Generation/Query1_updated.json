Nor does it matter that Obama is following the examples set by his modern predecessors whose time in office coincides with the instant transmission of news and the arrival of air travel, or that then-President George W. Bush didn\u2019t attend fellow Texan Lady Bird Johnson\u2019s funeral in 2007 (and no one raised a fuss).\nNo, none of it matters. Because, you know, Obama.\nOnly four times has a sitting president attended funeral services for a former first lady \u2014 five if you count the eulogy Bill Clinton delivered at Jackie Kennedy\u2019s burial in 1994. If I were to ask you who was the first sitting president to attend a former first lady\u2019s funeral, and whose funeral did he attend, you\u2019d never guess the answer. It\u2019s a guaranteed trivia stumper. So, since I sort of did just ask the question, go ahead, take a guess. I\u2019ll wait. \u2026\nGive up? The answer is Zachary Taylor, who attended \u2019s funeral in 1849 and gave us the term \u201cfirst lady\u201d in his eulogy \u2014 or so the story goes; there\u2019s no written evidence of it. Madison is an American icon. She\u2019s more famous than Taylor, who\u2019s one of those presidents you never think about until you hear his name and are reminded he was president. Two hundred years after she lived in the White House, Dolley Madison remains belle of the first lady ball. Who wouldn\u2019t have gone to her funeral?\nNo one, because it seems everyone who was someone in 1849 went. From the  of the James Madison University Magazine:\n> Dolley Madison fell ill in July 1849. She lingered for five days, and died on Thursday evening, July 12. She was 81 years...[Content truncated]",

Instead he is sticking with plans to visit Austin, Texas, for seven hours so he can chat onstage at the South by Southwest Interactive festival and appear at two Democratic fundraisers.\n\u201cSay what you will about President Obama, but it\u2019s hard to argue with the fact he\u2019s probably the most disrespectful and classless individual to ever occupy the White House,\u201d writes Michael Cantrell on the Young Conservatives website. Cantrell then goes on to repeat the debunked claim that Obama skipped Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s funeral to play golf.\nThat sitting presidents rarely attend the funerals of former first ladies doesn\u2019t seem to matter to the perpetually aggrieved critics of the president. Nor does it matter that Obama is following the examples set by his modern predecessors whose time in office coincides with the instant transmission of news and the arrival of air travel, or that then-President George W. Bush didn\u2019t attend fellow Texan Lady Bird Johnson\u2019s funeral in 2007 (and no one raised a fuss).\nNo, none of it matters. Because, you know, Obama.\nOnly four times has a sitting president attended funeral services for a former first lady \u2014 five if you count the eulogy Bill Clinton delivered at Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis\u2019s burial in 1994. If I were to ask you who was the first sitting president to attend a former first lady\u2019s funeral, and whose funeral did he attend, you\u2019d never guess the answer.

Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is Catholic \u2014 as was Justice Scalia \u2014 and had a personal relationship with him and his family, will attend the funeral on Saturday at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception along with his wife, Jill.\nFacing questions again on Thursday about the decision, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, did not offer a direct answer but implied that one reason was the potential for the extensive presidential security detail to be disruptive.\n\u201cObviously, when the vice president travels to some place, his security footprint is at least a little bit lighter,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. \u201cBut given his personal relationship with the family and given the president\u2019s desire to find a respectful way to pay tribute to Justice Scalia\u2019s service to the country, we believe we have settled on an appropriate and respectful arrangement.\u201d\nThe empty seat left by Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death leaves the court with two basic options for cases left on the docket this term if the justices are deadlocked at 4 to 4.\nAdministration officials were stung by what they saw as an unfair attack on what they viewed as Mr. Obama\u2019s dignified and respectful reaction to Justice Scalia\u2019s death, a reaction they thought contrasted sharply with that of others in Washington who quickly politicized the loss. \nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
