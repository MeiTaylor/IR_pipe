                "content": "Advertisement\nSupported by\nBy Gardiner Harris\nWASHINGTON — The White House on Thursday tried to fend off criticism of President Obama’s decision not to attend the funeral this weekend of Justice Antonin Scalia, but even some administration allies lamented the move as a missed opportunity to ease the partisan warfare that has followed the justice’s death.\nMr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, will pay their respects by visiting the Supreme Court on Friday, when Justice Scalia will lie in repose in the Great Hall. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is Catholic — as was Justice Scalia — and had a personal relationship with him and his family, will attend the funeral on Saturday at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception along with his wife, Jill.\nFacing questions again on Thursday about the decision, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, did not offer a direct answer but implied that one reason was the potential for the extensive presidential security detail to be disruptive.\n“Obviously, when the vice president travels to some place, his security footprint is at least a little bit lighter,” Mr. Earnest said. “But given his personal relationship with the family and given the president’s desire to find a respectful way to pay tribute to Justice Scalia’s service to the country, we believe we have settled on an appropriate and respectful arrangement.”\nThe empty seat left by Justice Antonin Scalia’s death leaves the court with two basic options for cases left on the docket this term if the justices are deadlocked at 4 to 4.\nAdministration officials were stung by what they saw as an unfair attack on what they viewed as Mr. Obama’s dignified and respectful reaction to Justice Scalia’s death, a reaction they thought contrasted sharply with that of others in Washington who quickly politicized the loss. \nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

How he blessed him!”\nIf Friday, when the justice lay in repose at the supreme court, had been about Scalia the jurist, Saturday was about Scalia the Catholic family man. Father Paul told how his father – the first Italian-American appointed to the supreme court – felt affection for the church’s tradition, and also preached about how that faith played a role in his father’s career on court, which he served for three decades.\n“I hope that it is some consolation, if there are any lawyers present, that the Roman collar was not a shield against his criticism,” he said.\nHe noted Scalia’s 55 years of marriage to “a woman who could match him at every step and even hold him accountable”. He joked that his father sometimes mixed up the names of his nine children, then said the close bonds his father helped forge among the siblings were the greatest gift a parent could give his children. At that moment, his voice quivered slightly.\nAmong those attending were Vice-President Joe Biden, former vice-president Dick Cheney, former House speaker Newt Gingrich, members of Congress including Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz and all eight sitting justices of the supreme court. Four of the five Catholic justices took communion.\n> I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque?\nDonald Trump\nCruz’s election rival, Donald Trump, who was not present, waded into a controversy over Barack Obama’s non-attendance, tweeting during the service: “I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!”\nThe mass was full of the majesty and spectacle of the American Catholic church. The foundation stone of the National Shrine was laid in 1920. Gorgeous ceiling mosaics and stained glass windows depict biblical scenes. The two-hour funeral mass began and ended with the swinging of incense and carrying of a gold crucifix as the building resounded with singing and organ music.\nScalia’s sons and sons-in-law served as pallbearers to carry his flag-draped casket. The supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, who shared Scalia’s conservative values, read a passage from the New Testament’s Book of Romans.\nAs the guests poured out, Augustus Alzona, an estate agent from Bethesda, Maryland, mused: “If you want to see the entire Archdiocese of Washington Catholic establishment, you can’t get more establishment than this.”\nAsked about the president’s absence, Alzona replied: “As the holy father would say, who I am to judge? I think the vice-president’s attendance is appropriate. I’m certainly glad Senator Cruz is here but I hope it won’t affect his chances in the South Carolina primary.”\nObama and his wife, Michelle, were among...[Content truncated]",

But rather than also attending Scalia’s funeral on Saturday morning, Obama is dispatching Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.  \n   Barbara Perry, presidential studies director at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center, believes Scalia would not have wanted any president to attend.  \n “The announcement on the Supreme Court’s website said the mass is for ‘friends and family members ,’” said Perry, who got to know Scalia as a high court fellow. “And President Obama does not fit into either of those categories.  \n Perry does not believe Obama is missing an opportunity to extend an olive branch to Republicans and help ease the bitter partisanship that has plagued his tenure. “I don’t think it’s a political statement,” she said. “I think the decision was one made of out respect.  \n “And Justice Scalia was a private person.

        "Question": "Did President Obama prioritize golf over attending Justice Scalia's funeral based on video evidence?",
        "Answer": "Based on the evidence, President Obama did not prioritize golf over attending Justice Scalia's funeral. Instead, he decided to skip the funeral due to the perception of it being a private event intended for family and close friends, while instead paying his respects by visiting the Supreme Court where Justice Scalia lay in repose. The evidence indicates that this decision was not politically motivated, but rather a matter of respect for Justice Scalia’s privacy. Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, commented that the announcement for the mass indicated it was for \"friends and family members,\" and that Obama does not fit into either category, suggesting that his absence from the funeral was respectful, not dismissive. Additionally, the White House explained that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president might have disrupted the funeral, which further informed their decision. In conclusion, there is no substantial video evidence or context suggesting Obama was prioritizing golf over attending the funeral; the decision appears to stem from a complex interplay of respect for the deceased and logistical considerations surrounding a presidential appearance.",
