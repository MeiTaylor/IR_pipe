How he blessed him!”\nIf Friday, when the justice lay in repose at the supreme court, had been about Scalia the jurist, Saturday was about Scalia the Catholic family man. Father Paul told how his father – the first Italian-American appointed to the supreme court – felt affection for the church’s tradition, and also preached about how that faith played a role in his father’s career on court, which he served for three decades.\n“I hope that it is some consolation, if there are any lawyers present, that the Roman collar was not a shield against his criticism,” he said.\nHe noted Scalia’s 55 years of marriage to “a woman who could match him at every step and even hold him accountable”. He joked that his father sometimes mixed up the names of his nine children, then said the close bonds his father helped forge among the siblings were the greatest gift a parent could give his children. At that moment, his voice quivered slightly.\nAmong those attending were Vice-President Joe Biden, former vice-president Dick Cheney, former House speaker Newt Gingrich, members of Congress including Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz and all eight sitting justices of the supreme court. Four of the five Catholic justices took communion.\n> I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque?\nDonald Trump\nCruz’s election rival, Donald Trump, who was not present, waded into a controversy over Barack Obama’s non-attendance, tweeting during the service: “I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!”\nThe mass was full of the majesty and spectacle of the American Catholic church. The foundation stone of the National Shrine was laid in 1920. Gorgeous ceiling mosaics and stained glass windows depict biblical scenes. The two-hour funeral mass began and ended with the swinging of incense and carrying of a gold crucifix as the building resounded with singing and organ music.\nScalia’s sons and sons-in-law served as pallbearers to carry his flag-draped casket. The supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, who shared Scalia’s conservative values, read a passage from the New Testament’s Book of Romans.\nAs the guests poured out, Augustus Alzona, an estate agent from Bethesda, Maryland, mused: “If you want to see the entire Archdiocese of Washington Catholic establishment, you can’t get more establishment than this.”\nAsked about the president’s absence, Alzona replied: “As the holy father would say, who I am to judge? I think the vice-president’s attendance is appropriate. I’m certainly glad Senator Cruz is here but I hope it won’t affect his chances in the South Carolina primary.”\nObama and his wife, Michelle, were among...[Content truncated]",

                    "content": "MARFA, Tex. — In the cloistered chambers of the Supreme Court, Justice Antonin Scalia's days were highly regulated and predictable. He met with clerks, wrote opinions and appeared for arguments in the august courtroom on a schedule set months in advance.\nYet as details of Scalia’s sudden death trickled in Sunday, it appeared that the hours afterward were anything but orderly. The man known for his elegant legal opinions and profound intellect was found dead in his room at a hunting resort by the resort’s owner, who grew worried when Scalia didn’t appear at breakfast Saturday morning.\nIt then took hours for authorities in remote West Texas to find a justice of the peace, officials said Sunday. When they did, Presidio County Judge Cinderela Guevara pronounced Scalia dead of natural causes without seeing the body — which is permissible under Texas law — and without ordering an autopsy.\nAs official Washington tried to process what his demise means for politics and the law, some details of Scalia’s final hours remained opaque. As late as Sunday afternoon, for example, there were conflicting reports about whether an autopsy should have been performed. A manager at the El Paso funeral home where Scalia’s body was taken said that his family made it clear they did not want one.\nOne of two other officials who were called but couldn’t get to Scalia’s body in time said that she would have made a different decision on the autopsy.\nWashington Post reporter Robert Barnes explains where the Supreme Court stands after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia and how the vacant seat will impact the presidential election. (Video: Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)\n“If it had been me . . . I would want to know,” Juanita Bishop, a justice of the peace in Presidio, Tex., said in an interview Sunday of the chaotic hours after Scalia’s death at the Cibolo Creek Ranch, a luxury compound less than an hour from the Mexican border and about 40 miles south of Marfa.\nMeanwhile, Guevara acknowledged that she pronounced Scalia dead by phone, without seeing his body. Instead, she spoke to law enforcement officials at the scene — who assured her “there were no signs of foul play” — and Scalia’s physician in Washington, who said that the 79-year-old justice suffered from a host of chronic conditions.\n“He was having health issues,’’ Guevara said, adding that she is awaiting a statement from Scalia’s doctor that will be added to his...[Content truncated]",

The former first lady has died at 94, The Associated Press confirmed Sunday, March 6, 2016. (AP Photo/Haraz N. Ghanbari, File)\n!\nBy  | \nUPDATED: August 28, 2017 at 6:22 a.m.\nLoading your audio article\nPresident Barack Obama will not be attending Nancy Reagan’s funeral Friday in Simi Valley because of a previous commitment as a keynote speaker at the South by Southwest Music Festival in Texas.\nConservatives are outraged.\n“This is much bigger than whether he is at a conference, festival or golf game – or just didn’t want to go,” Tim Donnelly said. “He signed up to be president of the United States and, at a key moment when he’s supposed to represent us all, he chose not to do it.”\nDonnelly, a former Republican candidate for governor and Inland Empire-based conservative radio talk show host, said Obama has “shrunk the office of the presidency” by choosing to miss Reagan’s funeral.\nFirst lady Michelle Obama will attend the funeral at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, along with about 1,000 guests that will range from Newt Gingrich to Mr. T. Democratic presidential hopeful and , along with former first ladies Laura Bush and\nRosalynn Carter.\n•**RELATED:** \nReagan died Sunday morning at the age of 94. Her passing marked the end of an era for Republicans who looked up to her and President Ronald Reagan as the embodiment of the conservative movement. For Republicans, it’s the second high-profile death of revered conservatives in a matter of weeks. Last month, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died in Texas and had a high-profile funeral in Washington, DC.\nObama didn’t attend that funeral either – though he did pay his respects while Scalia lay in repose before the service.\n...[Content truncated]",

The beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate influence and power in the political process, including large corporations and development firms. As for the victims, the government now has license to transfer property from those with fewer resources to those with more.
