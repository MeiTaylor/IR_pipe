(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images gallery Related gallery Remembering Justice Antonin Scalia]\nThe incense-filled basilica hosted former clerks; Scalia had more than 100. As tradition holds, they stood vigil over the casket Friday and into the night at the Supreme Court.\nOne of the most prominent attendees was Paul Clement, a former clerk who served as solicitor general during George W. Bush’s presidency. Another former solicitor general, Ted Olson, who has argued several cases before the court including _Bush v. Gore_, was present.\nThe current solicitor general, Donald Verrilli, also was present, as were White House counsel Neil Eggleston and Attorney General Loretta lynch.\nTexas senator and presidential candidate Ted Cruz – who served as a clerk to former Chief Justice William Rehnquist – took a break from the campaign trail to mourn.\n“As Ronald Reagan was to the presidency, so too was Antonin Scalia to the U.S. Supreme Court,” Cruz told CNN after the funeral concluded. “Justice Scalia has been a personal hero of mine, virtually my entire life.”\nCruz reiterated his belief that a nomination to replace Scalia should wait until the next president takes office.\n“It has been 80 years since the Senate confirmed a Supreme Court nominee who was nominated during an election year and we should not start now,” Cruz said. “We have an election in just a few months and I think the American people should be able to choose the direction of this court.”\n Paul Sancya/AP and Alex Wong/Getty Images video Related video Do GOP rivals agree with Obama on Scalia replacement?]\nMichael Carvin, also a frequent Supreme Court advocate who has cases before the Supreme Court this term, also was in the audience. A group of federal judges arrived together, including three – Sri Srinivasan, Patricia Millett and Merrick Garland – who are considered possible nominees to replace Scalia.\nNot attending, however, was President Barack Obama, a decision that has been criticized by some Republicans. GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump on Saturday tweeted, “I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!”\n> > I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!\n> > \n> > — Donald J.

But rather than also attending Scalia’s funeral on Saturday morning, Obama is dispatching Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.  \n   Barbara Perry, presidential studies director at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center, believes Scalia would not have wanted any president to attend.  \n “The announcement on the Supreme Court’s website said the mass is for ‘friends and family members ,’” said Perry, who got to know Scalia as a high court fellow. “And President Obama does not fit into either of those categories.  \n Perry does not believe Obama is missing an opportunity to extend an olive branch to Republicans and help ease the bitter partisanship that has plagued his tenure. “I don’t think it’s a political statement,” she said. “I think the decision was one made of out respect.  \n “And Justice Scalia was a private person. It was only in recent years that he started doing some media appearances,” Perry said Friday by phone on her way to Washington for the funeral service. “He wouldn’t have wanted the huge spectacle that it would have been if the president attended,”  \n She also recalled her attendance at Justice William Brennan’s funeral, saying security was tight due to Clinton’s attendance: “I can remember going through the metal detectors — my pepper spray was confiscated.”  \n Ed Whalen, a former Scalia law clerk who now is president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, declined an interview Friday but told told The New York Times  he believes Obama made the right decision.  \n White House officials were quick to note that since news broke of Scalia’s death Saturday evening, the president has twice praised his service to the country and legal intellect.  \n “Obviously, Justice Scalia and I had different political orientations and probably would have disagreed on the outcome of certain cases,” Obama said Tuesday. “But there is no doubt that he was a giant on the Supreme Court, helped to shape the legal landscape.  \n “He was, by all accounts, a good friend and loved his family deeply,” he said. “And so, you know, it’s important, before we rush into all the politics of this, to take stock of somebody who made enormous contributions to the United States, and we are grateful not only for his service, but for his family’s service.”  \n But it was fewer than 24 hours before those very politics confronted Obama.  \n On Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest announced that the first couple would skip the funeral. He described Obama’s appearance beside Scalia’s American flag-draped casket as “an opportunity for the individual who is serving as the president of the United States to offer respect to...[Content truncated]",

It would have been nice if the President of the United States would have recognized its importance to the community.”\nObama stayed home Saturday  at Washington’s Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. He dispatched Vice President Joe Biden instead to honor Scalia, who served on the court for 30 years  in Texas.\n“Italian-Americans take paying respects at funerals very seriously,” said Philip Foglia, vice president of the Italian-American Museum. “Justice Scalia was a milestone for the community. The president’s absence was disappointing and ill-advised.”\n!\nSupreme Court Justice Antonin ScaliaZuma Press\nScalia was born in Trenton, NJ, and attended grade school in Queens and high school in Manhattan before becoming the leading conservative voice on the high court.\n“Only President Obama could turn a funeral into a partisan event,” said Adele Malpass, Manhattan’s GOP chairwoman. “He has once again missed an opportunity to bridge a partisan divide and chooses to divide people instead of bringing people together even when it comes to the funeral of a statesman.”\n!\nPallbearers carry the casket of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia down the steps of the Basil...[Content truncated]",

John McCain is remembered at memorial ceremonies in Arizona and Washington, D.C., this week, and when he lies in state at the U.S. Capitol on Friday, it will be a time for many of those who knew him to pay their respects. But President Trump will not attend the funeral — at the request of the Arizona Republican himself.\nThough the specific request marks a departure from the norms of memorializing notable political figures, the question of Trump’s attendance is part of a long history of meaning when it comes to presidential funeral attendance. It’s relatively common for other members of an administration to attend funerals in the president’s stead, but it’s also common for those decisions to be assigned great meaning.\nMcCain, who died at the age of 81 a little more than a year after being diagnosed with an aggressive brain cancer, had a longtime feud with Trump, which extended to pointed remarks in his farewell letter. McCain’s family had asked that Trump not attend funeral services prior to the Arizona senator’s death, according to initial reports from the New York Times later confirmed by the Associated Press. In his requests for the funeral, McCain asked that former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush deliver eulogies.\nTrump, who earned rebukes on Monday after flying flags at the White House at full staff, a decision he then reversed, is not the first president to be absent at the funeral of a person with great impact on American history.\nFormer president Lyndon Johnson did not attend the funeral for Martin Luther King Jr., citing security concerns, according to Rebecca Burns’ book Burial for a King: Martin Luther King Jr.’s Funeral and the Week that Transformed Atlanta and Rocked the Nation. Vice-President Hubert Humphrey was sent instead. Johnson spent the day of King’s funeral meeting with top advisors at Camp David to talk about the Vietnam War, while the civil rights leader was buried in Atlanta — but it was a decision that apparently left the president agonized, as he weighed his personal safety against the message he wanted to send and the meaning of his presence.\nMore recently, President Obama drew criticism when he declined to attend the funeral of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. While the decision was not totally out of the ordinary — previous presidents have skipped funerals for other Supreme Court justices — rumors flew about why Obama would not attend Scalia’s funeral. The situation showed that it’s easy to read into the...[Content truncated]",

Scalia was a conservative mainstay who was known for posing tough questions to lawyers and for provoking laughter with his observations during oral arguments.\nHis death left the court with four conservatives and four liberals and triggered a furious fight between President Barack Obama, set to name Scalia's successor, and Senate Republicans who have vowed to block any nominee from the Democratic president, with the court's balance of power at stake.\nCourt observers said Scalia could have represented the deciding vote in one of the two cases to be argued on Monday, involving the rights of criminal defendants.\nWith his absence, the court could end up splitting 4-4, meaning the lower court ruling would stand and no nationwide precedent would be set. The court also could order the case to be re-argued after the Senate confirms Scalia's replacement.\nWith the showdown between Obama and Senate Republicans raising the possibility of a long wait before Scalia's successor is confirmed, the court will remain shorthanded for an uncertain period of time.\nThe court could split 4-4 on several important cases during its current term, which runs through the end of June. They include its first abortion case since 2007, a presidential powers dispute involving Obama's unilateral actions on immigration policy, and a conservative challenge to organized labor's clout.\n**Utah case**\nThe court on Monday will hear an appeal filed by Utah officials of a ruling by the state's top court in favor of Edward Strieff, who was convicted on drug charges.\nThe state Supreme Court ruled that evidence presented by prosecutors against Strieff was inadmissible because it violated his right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures under the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment.\nScalia was in the majority in two 5-4 rulings in recent years backing police in similar cases.\n\"Scalia's vote might have been critical,\" George Washington University Law School professor Orin Kerr said of the Strieff case.\nStrieff was convicted of methamphetamine possession and a related drug charge after his vehicle was stopped by police.\nHis lawyers contend Strieff's Fourth Amendment rights were violated because although there was a warrant issued for his arrest at the time of the search, the police officer did not know that when he stopped Strieff's vehicle.\nBefore hearing Strieff's case, the justices will consider a dispute between a federal contractor and the U.S. government.\nThe first lawyer due to step up the lectern on Monday will be Thomas Saunders of the Wilmer...[Content truncated]",

How he blessed him!”\nIf Friday, when the justice lay in repose at the supreme court, had been about Scalia the jurist, Saturday was about Scalia the Catholic family man. Father Paul told how his father – the first Italian-American appointed to the supreme court – felt affection for the church’s tradition, and also preached about how that faith played a role in his father’s career on court, which he served for three decades.\n“I hope that it is some consolation, if there are any lawyers present, that the Roman collar was not a shield against his criticism,” he said.\nHe noted Scalia’s 55 years of marriage to “a woman who could match him at every step and even hold him accountable”. He joked that his father sometimes mixed up the names of his nine children, then said the close bonds his father helped forge among the siblings were the greatest gift a parent could give his children. At that moment, his voice quivered slightly.\nAmong those attending were Vice-President Joe Biden, former vice-president Dick Cheney, former House speaker Newt Gingrich, members of Congress including Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz and all eight sitting justices of the supreme court. Four of the five Catholic justices took communion.\n> I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque?\nDonald Trump\nCruz’s election rival, Donald Trump, who was not present, waded into a controversy over Barack Obama’s non-attendance, tweeting during the service: “I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!”\nThe mass was full of the majesty and spectacle of the American Catholic church. The foundation stone of the National Shrine was laid in 1920. Gorgeous ceiling mosaics and stained glass windows depict biblical scenes. The two-hour funeral mass began and ended with the swinging of incense and carrying of a gold crucifix as the building resounded with singing and organ music.\nScalia’s sons and sons-in-law served as pallbearers to carry his flag-draped casket. The supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, who shared Scalia’s conservative values, read a passage from the New Testament’s Book of Romans.\nAs the guests poured out, Augustus Alzona, an estate agent from Bethesda, Maryland, mused: “If you want to see the entire Archdiocese of Washington Catholic establishment, you can’t get more establishment than this.”\nAsked about the president’s absence, Alzona replied: “As the holy father would say, who I am to judge?

Bush attended the funeral for Chief Justice William Rehnquist.\nFormer President Bill Clinton attended the funerals for former Chief Justice Warren E.

In addition, a black drape was hung over the courtroom doors.\nDespite push back from Republicans who say Obama shouldn't nominate a replacement in an election year, the White House made it clear Wednesday that the Constitution gives the president the right to select a \"well qualified candidate\" to the Supreme Court.\nObama called Scalia a “brilliant legal mind” in hailing the justice after his unexpected death Saturday at age 79.\n\"He will no doubt be remembered as one of the most consequential judges and thinkers to serve on the Supreme Court,” Obama said in remarks Saturday night.\n!\nHalimah Abdullah\nHalimah Abdullah is a digital editor and writer for NBC News and is responsible for reporting, writing, editing and web producing ...[Content truncated]",

Hundreds of friends and admirers, many from the top echelons of Washington’s legal and political worlds, gathered for a send-off that was supposed to be, as Washington Archbishop Donald Cardinal Wuerl joked, in his opening remarks, “a simple parish family Mass.” A knowing laugh rippled through the pews.\nFunerals in Washington are rarely simple when it comes to such larger-than-life figures as Scalia. For many in the crowd, it was a day to mourn a man they knew and loved. For others, showing up was an affirmation of conservative bona fides and membership in this city’s power elite.\nWuerl name-checked a few VIPs in attendance: Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.; Vice ; former vice president Richard B. Cheney; former House speaker Newt Gingrich (whose wife, Callista, sang in the choir); and Catholic University President John Garvey.\nOthers created a frisson when they arrived, included Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch; Sen. Ted Cruz (a former Supreme Court clerk who stepped away from the campaign trail to attend the service); and Ted Olson, the renowned Washington lawyer who argued the 2000 _Bush v. Gore_ case before the Supreme Court and, in 2013, the test of California's same-sex marriage ban. There was also a section of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit — including three rumored to be in the running for Scalia's seat: Merrick Garland, Sri Srinivasan and Patricia Millett.\nBut it was an absence that created a firestorm. Conservatives loudly criticized President Obama for snubbing the longest-sitting justice when the White House announced he would not attend. Rejecting the notion that the decision was political, press secretary Josh Earnest defended sending Biden as “somebody that had his own personal relationship with Justice Scalia and his family.” What’s more, he said, Biden’s security footprint would be less disruptive. “We believe we have settled on an appropriate and respectful arrangement,” he said.\n...[Content truncated]",
