Emily, an avid Trump supporter, rates my columns with 1 to 5 stars and when I write about Trump I always get 1 star along with, \u201cCan\u2019t you ever say anything nice?\u201d It\u2019s near impossible.\nWe now have 100,000 Americans dead and 40 million unemployed due to Covid-19. Instead of consoling the nation\u2019s grief as every president in my lifetime, Republican and Democratic, would do, Trump tweets insane and baseless conspiracy theories. (Were he a CEO, he\u2019d be fired for or institutionalized.)\nOn Memorial Day, once again, Trump enriched his coffers by playing golf at his own course, bringing the total taxpayer expense for his golf to $138 million. \u201cI needed the exercise,\u201d Trump said of his outing. Exercise, driving a golf cart?\nTrump has actually driven a cart onto the green, perhaps to protect against inflaming his bogus \u201cbone spurs.\u201d Meanwhile, candidate Trump relentlessly chastised Obama\u2019s golfing but as POTUS Trump has played a whopping 270% more than Obama.\nEmily might be pleased as I just thought of kind words for Trump. He\u2019s possibly the best golfer to occupy the White House, but, of course, he ruins it because he\u2019s such a pathological cheater he\u2019s the subject of the best-selling book, \u201cCommander in Cheat,\u201d by Rick Reilly.\n\u201cTrump thinks playing by the rules is for losers,\u201d Reilly writes. \u201cHe cheats at everything, and sees other people only as marks.\u201d Just like the rest of his life, Trump\u2019s cheating at golf is so brazen caddies nicknamed him \u201cPele,\u201d because he constantly kicks his ball from the rough back onto the fairway.\nMemorial Day is a sacred holiday honoring those who gave their lives for an idea bigger than themselves. Sadly, Trump demonstrates he considers nothing to be bigger than himself. Disturbingly, after he laid the wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Trump, who will be 74 in June, swayed, as if having difficulty keeping his balance.\nLater, however, he sent off a series of vile rage tweets against women.

This is a big deal. Stone cold phony.\u201d\u00a0\n*   And at his Harrisburg, Pa., rally last night, a Business Insider headline from 2016 : \u201cCalifornia\u2019s Kamala Harris becomes first Indian-American US senator.\u201d (Well, duh. As , \u201cnews outlets don\u2019t do \u2018historic second\u2019 stories, they do \u2018historic first\u2019 stories, so you can find heds and ledes that ignore her black heritage.\u201d)\n**The one-two punch signaled very quickly** that Trump\u2019s NABJ comments weren\u2019t a onetime off-the-cuff screed, but an intentional line of attack that Trump thought out in advance and plans to use on the trail.\n**Trump world\u2019s thinking is they can paint Harris** as a \u201cphony\u201d who flip-flops or says whatever is politically advantageous in a given moment. (It\u2019s also just the latest iteration of his long history of trying to smear his critics and opponents as grifters and panderers.)\n**Indeed, you saw some semblance of this plan** in Vance\u2019s remarks last night, when he attacked Harris for having a \u201cchameleon-like nature\u201d and accused the VP of trying to adopt a southern accent during her Georgia rally when she spent part of her childhood in Canada.\n**\u201cShe is not who she pretends to be,\"** Vance  in Phoenix. \"She\u2019ll say one thing to one audience, another thing to another audience. \u2026 She's flip-flopped on every issue. She's fake, she's phony.\u201d\n**But Vance\u2019s execution of this strategy** is _far_ different from what Trump did. Just ask Hill Republicans, who are privately freaking out over Trump\u2019s latest broadsides.\n**We spent last night working the phones** calling Republicans to find out what the hell happened to attacking Harris as the \u201cborder czar\u201d who wants to end private health insurance, decriminalize border crossing and the like. And we can tell you this morning that **_virtually every Republican_** we spoke with was flat-out distraught by what they perceive as a self-inflicted wound not only for Trump, but for Republicans down the ballot.\n**We\u2019re not just talking about** moderate Republicans like former Maryland Gov.-turned-Senate hopeful **LARRY HOGAN** \u2014 who blasted Trump\u2019s statement as \u201cunacceptable and abhorrent\u201d \u2014 or Alaska Sen. **LISA MURKOWSKI**, who called the comments \u201cvery unfortunate.\u201d\n**Just take a look at some of...[Content truncated]",

Instead of ignoring the case, as they had for years, the national media now framed it as a major constitutional battle over press freedom.\nThat morning in Alexandria, my lawyers and I learned that the prosecutors were frustrated by my writing style. In \u201c,\u201d I didn\u2019t include attribution for many passages. I didn\u2019t explicitly say where I was getting my information, and I didn\u2019t identify what information was classified and what wasn\u2019t. That had been a conscious decision; I didn\u2019t want to interrupt the narrative flow of the book with phrases explaining how I knew each fact, and I didn\u2019t want to explicitly say how I had obtained so much sensitive information. If prosecutors couldn\u2019t point to specific passages to prove I had relied on confidential sources who gave me classified information, their criminal case against Sterling might fall apart.\nWhen I walked into the courtroom that morning, I thought the prosecutors might demand that I publicly identify specific passages in my book where I had relied on classified information and confidential sources. If I didn\u2019t comply, they could ask the judge to hold me in contempt and send me to jail.\nI was worried, but I felt certain that the hearing would somehow complete the long, strange arc I had been living as a national security investigative reporter for the past 20 years. As I took the stand, I thought about how I had ended up here, how much press freedom had been lost, and how drastically the job of national security reporting had changed in the post-9/11 era.\n]From top left to bottom right: Aldrich Ames, John I. Millis, John Deutch, Wen Ho Lee.\nPhoto: AP, Getty Images\nThere\u2019s no press roomat CIA headquarters, like there is at the White House. The agency doesn\u2019t hand out press passes that let reporters walk the halls, the way they do at the Pentagon. It doesn\u2019t hold regular press briefings, as the State Department has under most administrations. The one advantage that reporters covering the CIA have is time. Compared to other major beats in Washington, the CIA generates relatively few daily stories. You have more time to dig, more time to meet people and develop sources.\nI started covering the CIA in 1995. The Cold War was over, the CIA was downsizing, and CIA officer Aldrich Ames had just been unmasked as a Russian spy. A whole generation of senior CIA officials was leaving Langley. Many wanted to talk.\nI was the first reporter many of them had ever met. As they emerged from their insular lives at the CIA, they had...[Content truncated]",

Two weeks later, Hurricane Laura blew it down. Now the jury has to decide not whether to take it down, but whether to put it back up again.\nAnd then, of course, in Britain there was the statue of Edward Colston, a Bristol slave trader, which ended up in the drink. Britain\u2019s major cities, including Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and Leeds, are undertaking reviews of their statues.\nMany spurious arguments have been made about these actions, and I will come to them in a minute. But the debate around public art and memorialisation, as it pertains to statues, should be engaged not ducked. One response I have heard is that we should even out the score by erecting statues of prominent black, abolitionist, female and other figures that are underrepresented. I understand the motivation. To give a fuller account of the range of experiences, voices, hues and ideologies that have made us what we are. To make sure that public art is rooted in the lives of the whole public, not just a part of it, and that we all might see ourselves in the figures that are represented.\nBut while I can understand it, I do not agree with it. The problem isn\u2019t that we have too few statues, but too many. I think it is a good thing that so many of these statues of pillagers, plunderers, bigots and thieves have been taken down. I think they are offensive. But I don\u2019t think they should be taken down because they are offensive. I think they should be taken down because I think all statues should be taken down.\nHere, to be clear, I am talking about statues of people, not other works of public memorials such as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington DC, the Holocaust memorial in Berlin or the Famine memorial in Dublin. I think works like these serve the important function of public memorialisation, and many have the added benefit of being beautiful.\nThe same cannot be said of statues of people. I think they are poor as works of public art and poor as efforts at memorialisation. Put more succinctly, they are lazy and ugly. So yes, take down the slave traders, imperial conquerors, colonial murderers, warmongers and genocidal exploiters. But while you\u2019re at it, take down the freedom fighters, trade unionists, human rights champions and revolutionaries. Yes, remove Columbus, Leopold II, Colston and Rhodes. But take down Mandela, Gandhi, Seacole and Tubman, too.\nI don\u2019t think those two groups are moral equals....[Content truncated]",

Burton\nIt was shortly after I\u2019d spent the morning duck-hooking my way around the golf course while a bunch of middle-aged men looked on that I realized what a lonely planet we\u2019re building.\nOnce a year or so, I play golf with a group of guys I worked with at another magazine a couple of decades ago. Our games are mediocre-to-bad, but the gathering itself never fails to be spirit-lifting-to-sensational. There\u2019s catching up on careers and kids; good-natured ball-busting; downing of beer; chatter about the state of the world; and, of course, some reminiscing about the period when we all worked together. This year\u2019s outing was no different. Even as I flailed my way over 18 holes, I got to hear about Stump\u2019s new marketing business, Stieger\u2019s daughter\u2019s wedding, O\u2019Neill\u2019s publishing projects, and Kita\u2019s cruises around the world. On the nostalgia front, someone even brought up an incident I\u2019d completely forgotten about: the storied middle-aged-editor throwdown of 2001, in which two colleagues got into an argument\u201420 years later, no one really remembers why\u2014and ended up in the middle of the office, shoulders back and chests protruding, with one all but poking the other in the solar plexus and bellowing, \u201cYou wanna take this outside?!\u201d (I\u2019d chosen publishing over, say, police work because I assumed it was nonviolent.

But it was only fitting that in her death Rosalynn Carter, the pioneering woman who turned the role of first lady , did one final thing no one else has been able to do this year: lure Melania Trump out of Mar-a-Lago and back into the public eye. Not only that, but she created a situation in which Mrs. Trump was seated right next to Michelle Obama.\nMrs. Trump has eschewed almost every major event since leaving the White House in January 2021, including her husband\u2019s several court appearances (the rare exception being his  that he was once again running for president). But on Tuesday, as is custom, she joined the three other living former first ladies \u2014 Mrs. Obama, Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush \u2014 as well as Jill Biden, the current first lady, at the Glenn Memorial United Methodist Church in Atlanta, for Mrs. Carter\u2019s memorial service.\n\u201cRosalynn Carter would be so pleased she brought all of you together on this day,\u201d the journalist Judy Woodruff said.\nImage\nFrom left, former President Bill Clinton, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Obama at the service.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York Times\nIt was the first time since , in 2018, that all of the living first ladies had been in one place. (Mrs. Trump did not attend President Biden\u2019s inauguration.) As they sat one next to the other, diplomatically arranged in order of administration \u2014 Trump, Obama, Bush and Clinton, with the Bidens seated between the Clinton and Carter families \u2014 they offered an extraordinary snapshot of what Jason Carter, Mrs. Carter\u2019s grandson, called in his remarks a \u201cremarkable sisterhood.\u201d\nEach of them, in their own way, embodied Mrs. Carter\u2019s directive, once offered to , that they make the job their own. United (mostly) in black, their differences were in the details.\n* * *\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

When he was a teenager, a staph infection nearly took his life. A few years later he was alone in the Pacific on a life raft, praying that his rescuers would find him before the enemy did.\nGod answered those prayers. It turned out He had other plans for George H.W. Bush. For Dad\u2019s part, I think those brushes with death made him cherish the gift of life. And he vowed to live every day to the fullest.\nDad was always busy \u2013 a man in constant motion \u2013 but never too busy to share his love of life with those around him. He taught us to love the outdoors. He loved watching dogs flush a covey. He loved landing the elusive striper. And once confined to a wheelchair, he seemed happiest sitting in his favorite perch on the back porch at Walker\u2019s Point contemplating the majesty of the Atlantic. The horizons he saw were bright and hopeful. He was a genuinely optimistic man. And that optimism guided his children and made each of us believe that anything was possible.\nHe continually broadened his horizons with daring decisions. He was a patriot. After high school, he put college on hold and became a Navy fighter pilot as World War II broke out. Like many of his generation, he never talked about his service until his time as a public figure forced his hand. We learned of the attack on Chichi Jima, the mission completed, the shoot-down. We learned of the death of his crewmates, whom he thought about throughout his entire life. And we learned of his rescue.\nAnd then, another audacious decision; he moved his young family from the comforts of the East Coast to Odessa, Texas. He and mom adjusted to their arid surroundings quickly. He was a tolerant man. After all, he was kind and neighborly to the women with whom he, mom and I shared a bathroom in our small duplex \u2013 even after he learned their profession \u2013 ladies of the night. (Laughter.)\nDad could relate to people from all walks of life. He was an empathetic man. He valued character over pedigree. And he was no cynic. He looked for the good in each person \u2013 and usually found it.\nDad taught us that public service is noble and necessary; that one can serve with integrity and hold true to the important values, like faith and family. He strongly believed that it was important to give back...[Content truncated]",
