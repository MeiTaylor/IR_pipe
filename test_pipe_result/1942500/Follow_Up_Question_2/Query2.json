It is unclear whether former President Jimmy Carter, who is in , will be well enough to attend, and what other former presidents and dignitaries will be on hand.\nBut The Washington Post  that the wife of former President Donald Trump was invited and that Rosalynn Carter had been involved in the decision. The gesture was an olive branch to Trump supporters, but more than that: It was also a genteel, Southern mother’s way of showing an unruly nation how to behave.\nIt was a lesson badly needed.\n!\nFrom left, President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump, former President Barack Obama, former first lady Michelle Obama, former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and former President Jimmy Carter and former first lady Rosalynn Carter participate in the State Funeral for former President George H.W. Bush, at the National Cathedral, Wednesday, Dec. 5, 2018 in Washington. | Alex Brandon, Associated Press\nAssuming she goes to the services, this won’t be the first time Melania Trump has been in the company of Barack and Michelle Obama, and Bill and Hillary Clinton; the Trumps were among the attendees at the state funeral for former President George H.W. Bush in 2018.\nBut a lot has happened since then, and the animosity between Donald Trump and President Joe Biden makes it virtually impossible to imagine a day when the current president and first lady, and the former president and first lady, and all their predecessors, sit together on the same pew of the National Cathedral — or do anything together, whether amicably or gritting their teeth.\nIn 2021, on the 20th anniversary of 9/11, Trump did not join other former presidents when they gathered at the site of the World Trade Center. Although George W. Bush also didn’t go to Ground Zero — instead going to Shanksville, Pennsylvania — Trump’s absence sparked a flurry of articles about his absence.\nEarlier that year, George W.

Fortunately, I have readers who email.\nTo name but two, there’s Jackie in Philadelphia and Emily in Tampa. Jackie agrees with my lampooning Donald Trump but she’s often funnier than I am. Emily, an avid Trump supporter, rates my columns with 1 to 5 stars and when I write about Trump I always get 1 star along with, “Can’t you ever say anything nice?” It’s near impossible.\nWe now have 100,000 Americans dead and 40 million unemployed due to Covid-19. Instead of consoling the nation’s grief as every president in my lifetime, Republican and Democratic, would do, Trump tweets insane and baseless conspiracy theories. (Were he a CEO, he’d be fired for or institutionalized.)\nOn Memorial Day, once again, Trump enriched his coffers by playing golf at his own course, bringing the total taxpayer expense for his golf to $138 million. “I needed the exercise,” Trump said of his outing. Exercise, driving a golf cart?\nTrump has actually driven a cart onto the green, perhaps to protect against inflaming his bogus “bone spurs.” Meanwhile, candidate Trump relentlessly chastised Obama’s golfing but as POTUS Trump has played a whopping 270% more than Obama.\nEmily might be pleased as I just thought of kind words for Trump. He’s possibly the best golfer to occupy the White House, but, of course, he ruins it because he’s such a pathological cheater he’s the subject of the best-selling book, “Commander in Cheat,” by Rick Reilly.\n“Trump thinks playing by the rules is for losers,” Reilly writes. “He cheats at everything, and sees other people only as marks.” Just like the rest of his life, Trump’s cheating at golf is so brazen caddies nicknamed him “Pele,” because he constantly kicks his ball from the rough back onto the fairway.\nMemorial Day is a sacred holiday honoring those who gave their lives for an idea bigger than themselves. Sadly, Trump demonstrates he considers nothing to be bigger than himself. Disturbingly, after he laid the wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Trump, who will be 74 in June, swayed, as if having difficulty keeping his balance.\nLater, however, he sent off a series of vile rage tweets against women. He suggested Nancy Pelosi “drinks on the job,” called Hillary Clinton...[Content truncated]",

Just ask Hill Republicans, who are privately freaking out over Trump’s latest broadsides.\n**We spent last night working the phones** calling Republicans to find out what the hell happened to attacking Harris as the “border czar” who wants to end private health insurance, decriminalize border crossing and the like. And we can tell you this morning that **_virtually every Republican_** we spoke with was flat-out distraught by what they perceive as a self-inflicted wound not only for Trump, but for Republicans down the ballot.\n**We’re not just talking about** moderate Republicans like former Maryland Gov.-turned-Senate hopeful **LARRY HOGAN** — who blasted Trump’s statement as “unacceptable and abhorrent” — or Alaska Sen. **LISA MURKOWSKI**, who called the comments “very unfortunate.”\n**Just take a look at some of...[Content truncated]",

Instead of ignoring the case, as they had for years, the national media now framed it as a major constitutional battle over press freedom.\nThat morning in Alexandria, my lawyers and I learned that the prosecutors were frustrated by my writing style. In “,” I didn’t include attribution for many passages. I didn’t explicitly say where I was getting my information, and I didn’t identify what information was classified and what wasn’t. That had been a conscious decision; I didn’t want to interrupt the narrative flow of the book with phrases explaining how I knew each fact, and I didn’t want to explicitly say how I had obtained so much sensitive information. If prosecutors couldn’t point to specific passages to prove I had relied on confidential sources who gave me classified information, their criminal case against Sterling might fall apart.\nWhen I walked into the courtroom that morning, I thought the prosecutors might demand that I publicly identify specific passages in my book where I had relied on classified information and confidential sources. If I didn’t comply, they could ask the judge to hold me in contempt and send me to jail.\nI was worried, but I felt certain that the hearing would somehow complete the long, strange arc I had been living as a national security investigative reporter for the past 20 years. As I took the stand, I thought about how I had ended up here, how much press freedom had been lost, and how drastically the job of national security reporting had changed in the post-9/11 era.\n]From top left to bottom right: Aldrich Ames, John I. Millis, John Deutch, Wen Ho Lee.\nPhoto: AP, Getty Images\nThere’s no press roomat CIA headquarters, like there is at the White House. The agency doesn’t hand out press passes that let reporters walk the halls, the way they do at the Pentagon. It doesn’t hold regular press briefings, as the State Department has under most administrations. The one advantage that reporters covering the CIA have is time. Compared to other major beats in Washington, the CIA generates relatively few daily stories. You have more time to dig, more time to meet people and develop sources.\nI started covering the CIA in 1995. The Cold War was over, the CIA was downsizing, and CIA officer Aldrich Ames had just been unmasked as a Russian spy. A whole generation of senior CIA officials was leaving Langley. Many wanted to talk.\nI was the first reporter many of them had ever met. As they emerged from their insular lives at the CIA, they had...[Content truncated]",

Two weeks later, Hurricane Laura blew it down. Now the jury has to decide not whether to take it down, but whether to put it back up again.\nAnd then, of course, in Britain there was the statue of Edward Colston, a Bristol slave trader, which ended up in the drink. Britain’s major cities, including Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and Leeds, are undertaking reviews of their statues.\nMany spurious arguments have been made about these actions, and I will come to them in a minute. But the debate around public art and memorialisation, as it pertains to statues, should be engaged not ducked. One response I have heard is that we should even out the score by erecting statues of prominent black, abolitionist, female and other figures that are underrepresented. I understand the motivation. To give a fuller account of the range of experiences, voices, hues and ideologies that have made us what we are. To make sure that public art is rooted in the lives of the whole public, not just a part of it, and that we all might see ourselves in the figures that are represented.\nBut while I can understand it, I do not agree with it. The problem isn’t that we have too few statues, but too many. I think it is a good thing that so many of these statues of pillagers, plunderers, bigots and thieves have been taken down. I think they are offensive. But I don’t think they should be taken down because they are offensive. I think they should be taken down because I think all statues should be taken down.\nHere, to be clear, I am talking about statues of people, not other works of public memorials such as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington DC, the Holocaust memorial in Berlin or the Famine memorial in Dublin. I think works like these serve the important function of public memorialisation, and many have the added benefit of being beautiful.\nThe same cannot be said of statues of people. I think they are poor as works of public art and poor as efforts at memorialisation. Put more succinctly, they are lazy and ugly. So yes, take down the slave traders, imperial conquerors, colonial murderers, warmongers and genocidal exploiters. But while you’re at it, take down the freedom fighters, trade unionists, human rights champions and revolutionaries. Yes, remove Columbus, Leopold II, Colston and Rhodes. But take down Mandela, Gandhi, Seacole and Tubman, too.\nI don’t think those two groups are moral equals....[Content truncated]",

Burton\nIt was shortly after I’d spent the morning duck-hooking my way around the golf course while a bunch of middle-aged men looked on that I realized what a lonely planet we’re building.\nOnce a year or so, I play golf with a group of guys I worked with at another magazine a couple of decades ago. Our games are mediocre-to-bad, but the gathering itself never fails to be spirit-lifting-to-sensational. There’s catching up on careers and kids; good-natured ball-busting; downing of beer; chatter about the state of the world; and, of course, some reminiscing about the period when we all worked together. This year’s outing was no different. Even as I flailed my way over 18 holes, I got to hear about Stump’s new marketing business, Stieger’s daughter’s wedding, O’Neill’s publishing projects, and Kita’s cruises around the world. On the nostalgia front, someone even brought up an incident I’d completely forgotten about: the storied middle-aged-editor throwdown of 2001, in which two colleagues got into an argument—20 years later, no one really remembers why—and ended up in the middle of the office, shoulders back and chests protruding, with one all but poking the other in the solar plexus and bellowing, “You wanna take this outside?!” (I’d chosen publishing over, say, police work because I assumed it was nonviolent. How young I was then.)\nAnyway…as I...[Content truncated]",

But it was only fitting that in her death Rosalynn Carter, the pioneering woman who turned the role of first lady , did one final thing no one else has been able to do this year: lure Melania Trump out of Mar-a-Lago and back into the public eye. Not only that, but she created a situation in which Mrs. Trump was seated right next to Michelle Obama.\nMrs. Trump has eschewed almost every major event since leaving the White House in January 2021, including her husband’s several court appearances (the rare exception being his  that he was once again running for president). But on Tuesday, as is custom, she joined the three other living former first ladies — Mrs. Obama, Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush — as well as Jill Biden, the current first lady, at the Glenn Memorial United Methodist Church in Atlanta, for Mrs. Carter’s memorial service.\n“Rosalynn Carter would be so pleased she brought all of you together on this day,” the journalist Judy Woodruff said.\nImage\nFrom left, former President Bill Clinton, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Obama at the service.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York Times\nIt was the first time since , in 2018, that all of the living first ladies had been in one place. (Mrs. Trump did not attend President Biden’s inauguration.) As they sat one next to the other, diplomatically arranged in order of administration — Trump, Obama, Bush and Clinton, with the Bidens seated between the Clinton and Carter families — they offered an extraordinary snapshot of what Jason Carter, Mrs. Carter’s grandson, called in his remarks a “remarkable sisterhood.”\nEach of them, in their own way, embodied Mrs. Carter’s directive, once offered to , that they make the job their own. United (mostly) in black, their differences were in the details.\n* * *\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

When he was a teenager, a staph infection nearly took his life. A few years later he was alone in the Pacific on a life raft, praying that his rescuers would find him before the enemy did.\nGod answered those prayers. It turned out He had other plans for George H.W. Bush. For Dad’s part, I think those brushes with death made him cherish the gift of life. And he vowed to live every day to the fullest.\nDad was always busy – a man in constant motion – but never too busy to share his love of life with those around him. He taught us to love the outdoors. He loved watching dogs flush a covey. He loved landing the elusive striper. And once confined to a wheelchair, he seemed happiest sitting in his favorite perch on the back porch at Walker’s Point contemplating the majesty of the Atlantic. The horizons he saw were bright and hopeful. He was a genuinely optimistic man. And that optimism guided his children and made each of us believe that anything was possible.\nHe continually broadened his horizons with daring decisions. He was a patriot.

He and mom adjusted to their arid surroundings quickly. He was a tolerant man. After all, he was kind and neighborly to the women with whom he, mom and I shared a bathroom in our small duplex – even after he learned their profession – ladies of the night. (Laughter.)\nDad could relate to people from all walks of life. He was an empathetic man. He valued character over pedigree. And he was no cynic. He looked for the good in each person – and usually found it.\nDad taught us that public service is noble and necessary; that one can serve with integrity and hold true to the important values, like faith and family. He strongly believed that it was important to give back...[Content truncated]",
