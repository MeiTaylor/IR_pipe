                "content": "The farewell to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia took place in the resplendent Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, the largest Catholic church in the United States. Hundreds of friends and admirers, many from the top echelons of Washington’s legal and political worlds, gathered for a send-off that was supposed to be, as Washington Archbishop Donald Cardinal Wuerl joked, in his opening remarks, “a simple parish family Mass.” A knowing laugh rippled through the pews.\nFunerals in Washington are rarely simple when it comes to such larger-than-life figures as Scalia. For many in the crowd, it was a day to mourn a man they knew and loved. For others, showing up was an affirmation of conservative bona fides and membership in this city’s power elite.\nWuerl name-checked a few VIPs in attendance: Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.; Vice ; former vice president Richard B. Cheney; former House speaker Newt Gingrich (whose wife, Callista, sang in the choir); and Catholic University President John Garvey.\nOthers created a frisson when they arrived, included Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch; Sen. Ted Cruz (a former Supreme Court clerk who stepped away from the campaign trail to attend the service); and Ted Olson, the renowned Washington lawyer who argued the 2000 _Bush v. Gore_ case before the Supreme Court and, in 2013, the test of California's same-sex marriage ban. There was also a section of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit — including three rumored to be in the running for Scalia's seat: Merrick Garland, Sri Srinivasan and Patricia Millett.\nBut it was an absence that created a firestorm. Conservatives loudly criticized President Obama for snubbing the longest-sitting justice when the White House announced he would not attend. Rejecting the notion that the decision was political, press secretary Josh Earnest defended sending Biden as “somebody that had his own personal relationship with Justice Scalia and his family.” What’s more, he said, Biden’s security footprint would be less disruptive. “We believe we have settled on an appropriate and respectful arrangement,” he said.\n...[Content truncated]",

But rather than also attending Scalia’s funeral on Saturday morning, Obama is dispatching Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.  \n   Barbara Perry, presidential studies director at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center, believes Scalia would not have wanted any president to attend.  \n “The announcement on the Supreme Court’s website said the mass is for ‘friends and family members ,’” said Perry, who got to know Scalia as a high court fellow. “And President Obama does not fit into either of those categories.  \n Perry does not believe Obama is missing an opportunity to extend an olive branch to Republicans and help ease the bitter partisanship that has plagued his tenure. “I don’t think it’s a political statement,” she said. “I think the decision was one made of out respect.  \n “And Justice Scalia was a private person. It was only in recent years that he started doing some media appearances,” Perry said Friday by phone on her way to Washington for the funeral service. “He wouldn’t have wanted the huge spectacle that it would have been if the president attended,”  \n She also recalled her attendance at Justice William Brennan’s funeral, saying security was tight due to Clinton’s attendance: “I can remember going through the metal detectors — my pepper spray was confiscated.”  \n Ed Whalen, a former Scalia law clerk who now is president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, declined an interview Friday but told told The New York Times  he believes Obama made the right decision.  \n White House officials were quick to note that since news broke of Scalia’s death Saturday evening, the president has twice praised his service to the country and legal intellect.  \n “Obviously, Justice Scalia and I had different political orientations and probably would have disagreed on the outcome of certain cases,” Obama said Tuesday. “But there is no doubt that he was a giant on the Supreme Court, helped to shape the legal landscape.  \n “He was, by all accounts, a good friend and loved his family deeply,” he said. “And so, you know, it’s important, before we rush into all the politics of this, to take stock of somebody who made enormous contributions to the United States, and we are grateful not only for his service, but for his family’s service.”  \n But it was fewer than 24 hours before those very politics confronted Obama.  \n On Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest announced that the first couple would skip the funeral.

But it was only fitting that in her death Rosalynn Carter, the pioneering woman who turned the role of first lady , did one final thing no one else has been able to do this year: lure Melania Trump out of Mar-a-Lago and back into the public eye. Not only that, but she created a situation in which Mrs. Trump was seated right next to Michelle Obama.\nMrs. Trump has eschewed almost every major event since leaving the White House in January 2021, including her husband’s several court appearances (the rare exception being his  that he was once again running for president). But on Tuesday, as is custom, she joined the three other living former first ladies — Mrs. Obama, Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush — as well as Jill Biden, the current first lady, at the Glenn Memorial United Methodist Church in Atlanta, for Mrs. Carter’s memorial service.\n“Rosalynn Carter would be so pleased she brought all of you together on this day,” the journalist Judy Woodruff said.\nImage\nFrom left, former President Bill Clinton, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Obama at the service.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York Times\nIt was the first time since , in 2018, that all of the living first ladies had been in one place. (Mrs. Trump did not attend President Biden’s inauguration.) As they sat one next to the other, diplomatically arranged in order of administration — Trump, Obama, Bush and Clinton, with the Bidens seated between the Clinton and Carter families — they offered an extraordinary snapshot of what Jason Carter, Mrs. Carter’s grandson, called in his remarks a “remarkable sisterhood.”\nEach of them, in their own way, embodied Mrs. Carter’s directive, once offered to , that they make the job their own.

Hundreds of friends and admirers, many from the top echelons of Washington’s legal and political worlds, gathered for a send-off that was supposed to be, as Washington Archbishop Donald Cardinal Wuerl joked, in his opening remarks, “a simple parish family Mass.” A knowing laugh rippled through the pews.\nFunerals in Washington are rarely simple when it comes to such larger-than-life figures as Scalia. For many in the crowd, it was a day to mourn a man they knew and loved. For others, showing up was an affirmation of conservative bona fides and membership in this city’s power elite.\nWuerl name-checked a few VIPs in attendance: Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.; Vice ; former vice president Richard B. Cheney; former House speaker Newt Gingrich (whose wife, Callista, sang in the choir); and Catholic University President John Garvey.\nOthers created a frisson when they arrived, included Attorney General Loretta E.

Circuit — including three rumored to be in the running for Scalia's seat: Merrick Garland, Sri Srinivasan and Patricia Millett.\nBut it was an absence that created a firestorm. Conservatives loudly criticized President Obama for snubbing the longest-sitting justice when the White House announced he would not attend. Rejecting the notion that the decision was political, press secretary Josh Earnest defended sending Biden as “somebody that had his own personal relationship with Justice Scalia and his family.” What’s more, he said, Biden’s security footprint would be less disruptive. “We believe we have settled on an appropriate and respectful arrangement,” he said.\n...[Content truncated]"

But rather than also attending Scalia’s funeral on Saturday morning, Obama is dispatching Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.  \n   Barbara Perry, presidential studies director at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center, believes Scalia would not have wanted any president to attend.  \n “The announcement on the Supreme Court’s website said the mass is for ‘friends and family members ,’” said Perry, who got to know Scalia as a high court fellow. “And President Obama does not fit into either of those categories.  \n Perry does not believe Obama is missing an opportunity to extend an olive branch to Republicans and help ease the bitter partisanship that has plagued his tenure. “I don’t think it’s a political statement,” she said. “I think the decision was one made of out respect.  \n “And Justice Scalia was a private person. It was only in recent years that he started doing some media appearances,” Perry said Friday by phone on her way to Washington for the funeral service. “He wouldn’t have wanted the huge spectacle that it would have been if the president attended,”  \n She also recalled her attendance at Justice William Brennan’s funeral, saying security was tight due to Clinton’s attendance: “I can remember going through the metal detectors — my pepper spray was confiscated.”  \n Ed Whalen, a former Scalia law clerk who now is president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, declined an interview Friday but told told The New York Times  he believes Obama made the right decision.  \n White House officials were quick to note that since news broke of Scalia’s death Saturday evening, the president has twice praised his service to the country and legal intellect.  \n “Obviously, Justice Scalia and I had different political orientations and probably would have disagreed on the outcome of certain cases,” Obama said Tuesday. “But there is no doubt that he was a giant on the Supreme Court, helped to shape the legal landscape.  \n “He was, by all accounts, a good friend and loved his family deeply,” he said. “And so, you know, it’s important, before we rush into all the politics of this, to take stock of somebody who made enormous contributions to the United States, and we are grateful not only for his service, but for his family’s service.”  \n But it was fewer than 24 hours before those very politics confronted Obama.  \n On Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest announced that the first couple would skip the funeral. He described Obama’s appearance beside Scalia’s American flag-draped casket as “an opportunity for the individual who is serving as the president of the United States to offer respect to...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What were the public and media reactions to Obama's absence from Scalia's funeral versus his golf outing?",
        "Answer": "The public and media reactions to President Obama's absence from Justice Scalia's funeral varied significantly, particularly in contrast to how they perceived his golf outing during that time.\n\n1. **Criticism of Absence from Funeral**: Various media outlets, particularly conservative ones, were quite vocal in their criticism of Obama's absence at Scalia's funeral. Reports indicated that many viewed his decision as a slight not only to Scalia's family but also to the Italian-American community, given Scalia's background as the first Italian-American Supreme Court Justice. Neil Mattera, president of the Columbus Alliance, expressed that the absence was disappointing, with others commenting that it converted a moment of mourning into a partisan issue. Some noted that it was \"historic\" and should have been recognized by the President, highlighting the missed opportunity to bridge partisan divides during a somber occasion.\n\n2. **Defense of Decision**: Supporters of Obama framed the decision not to attend as one of respect for Justice Scalia's wishes for a private service meant for \"friends and family.\" Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, reinforced this perspective by stating that Scalia likely would not have wanted the 'spectacle' that would have accompanied the president's attendance. The White House also indicated that logistical concerns, such as the security footprint of a sitting president, played a role in the decision, with Vice President Joe Biden attending instead.\n\n3. **Comparison to Golf Outing**: While Obama’s decision to skip the funeral was scrutinized and characterized as a snub, his golf outing came under different light. The media generally questioned whether the timing of his golf round during the weekend of Scalia’s funeral overshadowed the serious nature of the event. However, the focus remained largely on the absence from the funeral, which created a larger narrative around his presidency's perceived disrespect towards conservative figures compared to the implications of golfing.\n\nIn conclusion, the media and public reactions largely centered around criticisms of Obama for his absence from Scalia's funeral, framing it as disrespectful, while the decision to play golf did not receive as much critical visibility. The handling of his absence suggested a disconnect with political protocols surrounding significant national events, illustrating a mixed reception where his golfing was overshadowed by the political ramifications of missing the funeral.",
