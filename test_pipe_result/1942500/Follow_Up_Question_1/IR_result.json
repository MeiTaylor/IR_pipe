It outlines that Obama chose to pay his respects at the Supreme Court where Scalia lay in repose and includes the statement from White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, emphasizing respect and the need to avoid disruption due to presidential security. This information is crucial for evaluating the claim that Obama prioritized golf over attending the funeral."

                "content": "Advertisement\nSupported by\nBy Gardiner Harris\nWASHINGTON — The White House on Thursday tried to fend off criticism of President Obama’s decision not to attend the funeral this weekend of Justice Antonin Scalia, but even some administration allies lamented the move as a missed opportunity to ease the partisan warfare that has followed the justice’s death.\nMr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, will pay their respects by visiting the Supreme Court on Friday, when Justice Scalia will lie in repose in the Great Hall. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is Catholic — as was Justice Scalia — and had a personal relationship with him and his family, will attend the funeral on Saturday at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception along with his wife, Jill.\nFacing questions again on Thursday about the decision, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, did not offer a direct answer but implied that one reason was the potential for the extensive presidential security detail to be disruptive.\n“Obviously, when the vice president travels to some place, his security footprint is at least a little bit lighter,” Mr. Earnest said. “But given his personal relationship with the family and given the president’s desire to find a respectful way to pay tribute to Justice Scalia’s service to the country, we believe we have settled on an appropriate and respectful arrangement.”\nThe empty seat left by Justice Antonin Scalia’s death leaves the court with two basic options for cases left on the docket this term if the justices are deadlocked at 4 to 4.\nAdministration officials were stung by what they saw as an unfair attack on what they viewed as Mr. Obama’s dignified and respectful reaction to Justice Scalia’s death, a reaction they thought contrasted sharply with that of others in Washington who quickly politicized the loss. \nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

            "content": " President Barack Obama is taking fire from friends and foes alike for skipping Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia’s funeral. But even some with ties to Scalia believe he is right in bowing out.  \n The president and first lady Michelle Obama on Friday afternoon made the 2 1/2-mile trek from the White House to the Supreme Court, where the 79-year-old conservative justice’s body laid in repose. But rather than also attending Scalia’s funeral on Saturday morning, Obama is dispatching Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.  \n   Barbara Perry, presidential studies director at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center, believes Scalia would not have wanted any president to attend.  \n “The announcement on the Supreme Court’s website said the mass is for ‘friends and family members ,’” said Perry, who got to know Scalia as a high court fellow. “And President Obama does not fit into either of those categories.  \n Perry does not believe Obama is missing an opportunity to extend an olive branch to Republicans and help ease the bitter partisanship that has plagued his tenure. “I don’t think it’s a political statement,” she said. “I think the decision was one made of out respect.  \n “And Justice Scalia was a private person. It was only in recent years that he started doing some media appearances,” Perry said Friday by phone on her way to Washington for the funeral service. “He wouldn’t have wanted the huge spectacle that it would have been if the president attended,”  \n She also recalled her attendance at Justice William Brennan’s funeral, saying security was tight due to Clinton’s attendance: “I can remember going through the metal detectors — my pepper spray was confiscated.”  \n Ed Whalen, a former Scalia law clerk who now is president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, declined an interview Friday but told told The New York Times  he believes Obama made the right decision.  \n White House officials were quick to note that since news broke of Scalia’s death Saturday evening, the president has twice praised his service to the country and legal intellect.  \n “Obviously, Justice Scalia and I had different political orientations and probably would have disagreed on the outcome of certain cases,” Obama said Tuesday. “But...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What were the official reasons given by the White House for President Obama's absence from Justice Scalia's funeral?",
        "Answer": "The official reasons given by the White House for President Obama's absence from Justice Scalia's funeral include the following: 1. **Paying Respects at the Supreme Court**: The White House confirmed that President Obama would pay his respects on the day prior to the funeral, when Scalia’s body was lying in repose at the Great Hall of the Supreme Court. This was considered an appropriate way for the president to honor Justice Scalia, according to White House spokesperson Josh Earnest, who stated, \"the president will pay his respects at the Supreme Court on Friday\". 2. **Respect for the Funeral's Intimacy**: Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, noted that the funeral was described as a service for \"friends and family members,\" and argued that since President Obama does not fit into either of those categories, his absence was respectful rather than dismissive. She emphasized that Justice Scalia was a private person who likely would not have wanted the spectacle that would accompany a presidential attendance. 3. **Security Considerations**: The White House pointed out that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president could have disrupted the funeral services. This logistical concern was part of the rationale behind the decision to send Vice President Joe Biden instead, who was available to attend without the same level of disruption. The overall conclusion from the evidence suggests that while the decision not to attend Scalia's funeral was politically charged and criticized by some, it was framed by the White House as a respectful choice guided by considerations of the nature of the event and logistical concerns.",
