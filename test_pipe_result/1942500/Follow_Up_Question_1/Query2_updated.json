It was only in recent years that he started doing some media appearances,\u201d Perry said Friday by phone on her way to Washington for the funeral service. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have wanted the huge spectacle that it would have been if the president attended,\u201d \u00a0\n She also recalled her attendance at Justice William Brennan\u2019s funeral, saying security was tight due to Clinton\u2019s...[Content truncated]",

West Point is guided by tradition, and in honor of the \u201cGolden Children of the Corps,\u201d I will observe one of the traditions you cherish most. As the Commander-in-Chief, I hereby grant amnesty to all cadets who are on restriction for minor conduct offenses. Those of you in the end zone might have cheered a little early.

Some West Point classes are also commissioned by history, to take part in a great new calling for their country. Speaking here to the class of 1942 \u2014 six months after Pearl Harbor \u2014 General Marshall said, \u201cWe\u2019re determined that before the sun sets on this terrible struggle, our fl ag will be recognized throughout the world as a symbol of freedom on the one hand, and of overwhelming power on the other.\u201d Of fi cers graduating that year helped ful fi ll that mission, defeating Japan and Germany, and then reconstructing those nations as allies. West Point graduates of the 1940s saw the rise of a deadly new challenge \u2014 the challenge of imperial communism \u2014 and opposed it from Korea to Berlin, to Vietnam, and in the Cold War, from beginning to end. And as the sun set on their struggle, many of those West Point of fi cers lived to see a world transformed. History has also issued its call to your generation. In your last year, America was attacked by a ruthless and resourceful enemy. You graduate from this Academy in a time of war, taking your place in an American military that is powerful and is honorable. Our war \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 127 \non terror is only begun, but in Afghanistan it was begun well. I am proud of the men and women who have fought on my orders. America is profoundly grateful for all who serve the cause of freedom, and for all who have given their lives in its defense.

For many in the crowd, it was a day to mourn a man they knew and loved. For others, showing up was an affirmation of conservative bona fides and membership in this city\u2019s power elite.\nWuerl name-checked a few VIPs in attendance: Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.; Vice ; former vice president Richard B. Cheney; former House speaker Newt Gingrich (whose wife, Callista, sang in the choir); and Catholic University President John Garvey.\nOthers created a frisson when they arrived, included Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch; Sen. Ted Cruz (a former Supreme Court clerk who stepped away from the campaign trail to attend the service); and Ted Olson, the renowned Washington lawyer who argued the 2000 _Bush v. Gore_ case before the Supreme Court and, in 2013, the test of California's same-sex marriage ban. There was also a section of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit \u2014 including three rumored to be in the running for Scalia's seat: Merrick Garland, Sri Srinivasan and Patricia Millett.\nBut it was an absence that created a firestorm. Conservatives loudly criticized President Obama for snubbing the longest-sitting justice when the White House announced he would not attend. Rejecting the notion that the decision was political, press secretary Josh Earnest defended sending Biden as \u201csomebody that had his own personal relationship with Justice Scalia and his family.\u201d What\u2019s more, he said, Biden\u2019s security footprint would be less disruptive. \u201cWe believe we have settled on an appropriate and respectful arrangement,\u201d he said.\nMourners pay respects to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia\nScalia is laid to rest at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington.\nThe president and first lady , when Scalia's body lay in repose in the Great Hall of the Supreme Court.\nIt\u2019s rare for a justice to die in office, so there\u2019s little precedent for presidential attendance. In 2005, President George W. Bush spoke at the funeral of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. President Dwight Eisenhower came to the service for Chief Justice Fred Vinson in 1953 but did not attend the funeral of Associate Justice Robert Jackson a year later.

John McCain is remembered at memorial ceremonies in Arizona and Washington, D.C., this week, and when he lies in state at the U.S. Capitol on Friday, it will be a time for many of those who knew him to pay their respects. But President Trump will not attend the funeral \u2014 at the request of the Arizona Republican himself.\nThough the specific request marks a departure from the norms of memorializing notable political figures, the question of Trump\u2019s attendance is part of a long history of meaning when it comes to presidential funeral attendance. It\u2019s relatively common for other members of an administration to attend funerals in the president\u2019s stead, but it\u2019s also common for those decisions to be assigned great meaning.\nMcCain, who died at the age of 81 a little more than a year after being diagnosed with an aggressive brain cancer, had a longtime feud with Trump, which extended to pointed remarks in his farewell letter. McCain\u2019s family had asked that Trump not attend funeral services prior to the Arizona senator\u2019s death, according to initial reports from the New York Times later confirmed by the Associated Press. In his requests for the funeral, McCain asked that former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush deliver eulogies.\nTrump, who earned rebukes on Monday after flying flags at the White House at full staff, a decision he then reversed, is not the first president to be absent at the funeral of a person with great impact on American history.\nFormer president Lyndon Johnson did not attend the funeral for Martin Luther King Jr., citing security concerns, according to Rebecca Burns\u2019...[Content truncated]",

The Supreme Court announced her death, saying the cause was complications from metastatic cancer of the pancreas.\nThe court, in a statement, said Ginsburg died at her home in Washington, D.C., surrounded by family. She was 87.\n\"Our nation has lost a justice of historic stature,\" Chief Justice John Roberts said. \"We at the Supreme Court have lost a cherished colleague. Today we mourn but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her, a tireless and resolute champion of justice.\"\nArchitect of the legal fight for women's rights in the 1970s, Ginsburg subsequently served 27 years on the nation's highest court, becoming its most prominent member. Her death will inevitably set in motion what promises to be a nasty and tumultuous political battle over who will succeed her, and it thrusts the Supreme Court vacancy into the spotlight of the presidential campaign.\nJust days before her death, as her strength waned, Ginsburg dictated this statement to her granddaughter Clara Spera: \"My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.\"\nShe knew what was to come. Ginsburg's death will have profound consequences for the court and the country. Inside the court, not only is the leader of the liberal wing gone, but with the court about to open a new term, the chief justice no longer holds the controlling vote in...[Content truncated]",
