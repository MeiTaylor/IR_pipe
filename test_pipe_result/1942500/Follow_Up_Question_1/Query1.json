Vice President Joe Biden will attend Scalia’s funeral at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, the White House said Wednesday during a press briefing.\n**Related: **\nWhen pressed for clarification on Obama missing the funeral, White House press secretary Josh Earnest repeated that \"the president will pay his respects at the Supreme Court on Friday and he'll be joined with the first lady when he does that.\"\nWhen asked whether Obama's Saturday plans include golfing, Earnest stressed instead that the president believes it is important to honor Scalia's life and service.\n**PHOTOS - **\nFour out of the past seven funerals for a Supreme Court justice have either had the president or vice president in attendance.\nFormer President George W. Bush attended the funeral for Chief Justice William Rehnquist.\nFormer President Bill Clinton attended the funerals for former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice William Brennan but did not attend the funerals for Justices Harry Blackmun or Lewis F. Powell Jr.\nFormer Vice President Al Gore attended the funeral for Justice Thurgood Marshall.\nScalia's chair on the Supreme Court bench and the bench itself were draped with black wool crepe in memoriam Tuesday — a Supreme Court tradition. In addition, a black drape was hung over the courtroom doors.\nDespite push back from Republicans who say Obama shouldn't nominate a replacement in an election year, the White House made it clear Wednesday that the Constitution gives the president the right to select a \"well qualified candidate\" to the Supreme Court.\nObama called Scalia a “brilliant legal mind” in hailing the justice after his unexpected death Saturday at age 79.\n\"He will no doubt be remembered as one of the most consequential judges and thinkers to serve on the Supreme Court,” Obama said in remarks Saturday night.\n!\nHalimah Abdullah\nHalimah Abdullah is a digital editor and writer for NBC News and is responsible for reporting, writing, editing and web producing ...[Content truncated]",

It would have been nice if the President of the United States would have recognized its importance to the community.”\nObama stayed home Saturday  at Washington’s Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. He dispatched Vice President Joe Biden instead to honor Scalia, who served on the court for 30 years  in Texas.\n“Italian-Americans take paying respects at funerals very seriously,” said Philip Foglia, vice president of the Italian-American Museum. “Justice Scalia was a milestone for the community. The president’s absence was disappointing and ill-advised.”\n!\nSupreme Court Justice Antonin ScaliaZuma Press\nScalia was born in Trenton, NJ, and attended grade school in Queens and high school in Manhattan before becoming the leading conservative voice on the high court.\n“Only President Obama could turn a funeral into a partisan event,” said Adele Malpass, Manhattan’s GOP chairwoman. “He has once again missed an opportunity to bridge a partisan divide and chooses to divide people instead of bringing people together even when it comes to the funeral of a statesman.”\n!\nPallbearers carry the casket of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia down the steps of the Basilica...[Content truncated]",

But rather than also attending Scalia’s funeral on Saturday morning, Obama is dispatching Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.  \n   Barbara Perry, presidential studies director at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center, believes Scalia would not have wanted any president to attend.  \n “The announcement on the Supreme Court’s website said the mass is for ‘friends and family members ,’” said Perry, who got to know Scalia as a high court fellow. “And President Obama does not fit into either of those categories.  \n Perry does not believe Obama is missing an opportunity to extend an olive branch to Republicans and help ease the bitter partisanship that has plagued his tenure. “I don’t think it’s a political statement,” she said. “I think the decision was one made of out respect.  \n “And Justice Scalia was a private person. It was only in recent years that he started doing some media appearances,” Perry said Friday by phone on her way to Washington for the funeral service. “He wouldn’t have wanted the huge spectacle that it would have been if the president attended,”  \n She also recalled her attendance at Justice William Brennan’s funeral, saying security was tight due to Clinton’s attendance: “I can remember going through the metal detectors — my pepper spray was confiscated.”  \n Ed Whalen, a former Scalia law clerk who now is president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, declined an interview Friday but told told The New York Times  he believes Obama made the right decision.  \n White House officials were quick to note that since news broke of Scalia’s death Saturday evening, the president has twice praised his service to the country and legal intellect.  \n “Obviously, Justice Scalia and I had different political orientations and probably would have disagreed on the outcome of certain cases,” Obama said Tuesday. “But...[Content truncated]",

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images gallery Related gallery Remembering Justice Antonin Scalia]\nThe incense-filled basilica hosted former clerks; Scalia had more than 100. As tradition holds, they stood vigil over the casket Friday and into the night at the Supreme Court.\nOne of the most prominent attendees was Paul Clement, a former clerk who served as solicitor general during George W. Bush’s presidency. Another former solicitor general, Ted Olson, who has argued several cases before the court including _Bush v. Gore_, was present.\nThe current solicitor general, Donald Verrilli, also was present, as were White House counsel Neil Eggleston and Attorney General Loretta lynch.\nTexas senator and presidential candidate Ted Cruz – who served as a clerk to former Chief Justice William Rehnquist – took a break from the campaign trail to mourn.\n“As Ronald Reagan was to the presidency, so too was Antonin Scalia to the U.S. Supreme Court,” Cruz told CNN after the funeral concluded. “Justice Scalia has been a personal hero of mine, virtually my entire life.”\nCruz reiterated his belief that a nomination to replace Scalia should wait until the next president takes office.\n“It has been 80 years since the Senate confirmed a Supreme Court nominee who was nominated during an election year and we should not start now,” Cruz said. “We have an election in just a few months and I think the American people should be able to choose the direction of this court.”\n Paul Sancya/AP and Alex Wong/Getty Images video Related video Do GOP rivals agree with Obama on Scalia replacement?]\nMichael Carvin, also a frequent Supreme Court advocate who has cases before the Supreme Court this term, also was in the audience. A group of federal judges arrived together, including three – Sri Srinivasan, Patricia Millett and Merrick Garland – who are considered possible nominees to replace Scalia.\nNot attending, however, was President Barack Obama, a decision that has been criticized by some Republicans. GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump on Saturday tweeted, “I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!”\n> > I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!\n> > \n> > — Donald J.

John McCain is remembered at memorial ceremonies in Arizona and Washington, D.C., this week, and when he lies in state at the U.S. Capitol on Friday, it will be a time for many of those who knew him to pay their respects. But President Trump will not attend the funeral — at the request of the Arizona Republican himself.\nThough the specific request marks a departure from the norms of memorializing notable political figures, the question of Trump’s attendance is part of a long history of meaning when it comes to presidential funeral attendance. It’s relatively common for other members of an administration to attend funerals in the president’s stead, but it’s also common for those decisions to be assigned great meaning.\nMcCain, who died at the age of 81 a little more than a year after being diagnosed with an aggressive brain cancer, had a longtime feud with Trump, which extended to pointed remarks in his farewell letter. McCain’s family had asked that Trump not attend funeral services prior to the Arizona senator’s death, according to initial reports from the New York Times later confirmed by the Associated Press. In his requests for the funeral, McCain asked that former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush deliver eulogies.\nTrump, who earned rebukes on Monday after flying flags at the White House at full staff, a decision he then reversed, is not the first president to be absent at the funeral of a person with great impact on American history.\nFormer president Lyndon Johnson did not attend the funeral for Martin Luther King Jr., citing security concerns, according to Rebecca Burns’ book Burial for a King: Martin Luther King Jr.’s Funeral and the Week that Transformed Atlanta and Rocked the Nation. Vice-President Hubert Humphrey was sent instead. Johnson spent the day of King’s funeral meeting with top advisors at Camp David to talk about the Vietnam War, while the civil rights leader was buried in Atlanta — but it was a decision that apparently left the president agonized, as he weighed his personal safety against the message he wanted to send and the meaning of his presence.\nMore recently, President Obama drew criticism when he declined to attend the funeral of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. While the decision was not totally out of the ordinary — previous presidents have skipped funerals for other Supreme Court justices — rumors flew about why Obama would not attend Scalia’s funeral. The situation showed that it’s easy to read into the...[Content truncated]",

Is he the only president not to attend the funeral of a sitting Supreme Court justice and a former first lady?**\nIt is true that Obama did not attend the funerals of Scalia, who died on Feb. 13, and Reagan, who died on March 6.\nIt is rare for justices to die while serving - seven have died during four administrations from 1946 to 2016, FactCheck.org research found. Presidents attended three of the seven funerals, and Obama was the only one of the four not to attend at least one.\nScalia was considered one of the most influential conservative jurists in modern history, and Obama's decision not to attend his funeral was criticized by conservative news commentators. For example, Megyn Kelly, host of Fox News' \"The Kelly File,\" said on her Feb. 17 show: \"I find no precedent for this in history, that a sitting U.S. president would not attend the death of a sitting Supreme Court justice. Why wouldn't he go? The White House says he has no plans on Saturday.\"\nWhen FactCheck.org asked about Obama's plans for Scalia's funeral, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that the president and the first lady would pay their respects to Scalia as he...[Content truncated]",

How he blessed him!”\nIf Friday, when the justice lay in repose at the supreme court, had been about Scalia the jurist, Saturday was about Scalia the Catholic family man. Father Paul told how his father – the first Italian-American appointed to the supreme court – felt affection for the church’s tradition, and also preached about how that faith played a role in his father’s career on court, which he served for three decades.\n“I hope that it is some consolation, if there are any lawyers present, that the Roman collar was not a shield against his criticism,” he said.\nHe noted Scalia’s 55 years of marriage to “a woman who could match him at every step and even hold him accountable”. He joked that his father sometimes mixed up the names of his nine children, then said the close bonds his father helped forge among the siblings were the greatest gift a parent could give his children. At that moment, his voice quivered slightly.\nAmong those attending were Vice-President Joe Biden, former vice-president Dick Cheney, former House speaker Newt Gingrich, members of Congress including Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz and all eight sitting justices of the supreme court. Four of the five Catholic justices took communion.\n> I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque?\nDonald Trump\nCruz’s election rival, Donald Trump, who was not present, waded into a controversy over Barack Obama’s non-attendance, tweeting during the service: “I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!”\nThe mass was full of the majesty and spectacle of the American Catholic church. The foundation stone of the National Shrine was laid in 1920. Gorgeous ceiling mosaics and stained glass windows depict biblical scenes. The two-hour funeral mass began and ended with the swinging of incense and carrying of a gold crucifix as the building resounded with singing and organ music.\nScalia’s sons and sons-in-law served as pallbearers to carry his flag-draped casket. The supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, who shared Scalia’s conservative values, read a passage from the New Testament’s Book of Romans.\nAs the guests poured out, Augustus Alzona, an estate agent from Bethesda, Maryland, mused: “If you want to see the entire Archdiocese of Washington Catholic establishment, you can’t get more establishment than this.”\nAsked about the president’s absence, Alzona replied: “As the holy father would say, who I am to judge? I think the vice-president’s attendance is appropriate. I’m certainly glad Senator Cruz is here but I hope it won’t affect his chances in the South Carolina primary.”\nObama and his wife, Michelle, were among...[Content truncated]",

                    "content": "Advertisement\nSupported by\nBy Gardiner Harris\nWASHINGTON — The White House on Thursday tried to fend off criticism of President Obama’s decision not to attend the funeral this weekend of Justice Antonin Scalia, but even some administration allies lamented the move as a missed opportunity to ease the partisan warfare that has followed the justice’s death.\nMr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, will pay their respects by visiting the Supreme Court on Friday, when Justice Scalia will lie in repose in the Great Hall. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is Catholic — as was Justice Scalia — and had a personal relationship with him and his family, will attend the funeral on Saturday at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception along with his wife, Jill.\nFacing questions again on Thursday about the decision, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, did not offer a direct answer but implied that one reason was the potential for the extensive presidential security detail to be disruptive.\n“Obviously, when the vice president travels to some place, his security footprint is at least a little bit lighter,” Mr. Earnest said. “But given his personal relationship with the family and given the president’s desire to find a respectful way to pay tribute to Justice Scalia’s service to the country, we believe we have settled on an appropriate and respectful arrangement.”\nThe empty seat left by Justice Antonin Scalia’s death leaves the court with two basic options for cases left on the docket this term if the justices are deadlocked at 4 to 4.\nAdministration officials were stung by what they saw as an unfair attack on what they viewed as Mr. Obama’s dignified and respectful reaction to Justice Scalia’s death, a reaction they thought contrasted sharply with that of others in Washington who quickly politicized the loss. \nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
