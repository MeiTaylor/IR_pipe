    "Confidence": "30%",
    "Reason": "The existing information does not provide sufficient evidence to determine the truthfulness of the claim that President Obama snubbed Justice Scalia's funeral to play golf. While the video transcript discusses Obama's stance on filling Scalia's Supreme Court seat and mentions the funeral, it does not confirm whether Obama attended the funeral or was playing golf at the time. It primarily focuses on the political implications surrounding Scalia's death rather than Obama's personal activities or choices on that specific day. Therefore, we cannot conclusively assess the truth of the claim."

1. Online search is generally recommended for most questions to provide comprehensive and up-to-date information.
2. If the question can be fully and confidently answered using only the given 'Claim', 'Video_information', and 'QA_CONTEXTS', online search may not be necessary.
3. If the question specifically asks about details or content exclusively present in the video, online search may not be needed.
4. For any question that could benefit from additional context, background, or current information, online search is recommended.

Based on these criteria, determine if online search is needed (Yes or No). If online search could potentially provide any useful information or context, even if not strictly necessary, choose 'Yes'. Only choose 'No' if the question is entirely about specific video content that cannot be found online.

If the result is 'Yes', generate two new queries for Google Custom Search API. If 'No', do not provide any queries.

If generating queries:
- Ensure Query 1 and Query 2 focus on different aspects of the question and are not repetitive.
- Each query should be concise (not exceeding 10 words) and suitable for Google Custom Search API.
- Provide key terms that represent the core focus of each specific query. Key terms must be a single word.

Note: The generated queries should be phrases suitable for Google Search.

Historically, this has not been viewed as a question. There's no unwritten law that says that it can only be done on off ears. That's not in the constitutional text. And even some Republicans criticized what appeared to be a rush to the political barricade so soon after justice Scalia's death. This was a misstep. I think it was a political misstep. First off, that is not the first thing you say within hours of the passing of someone like, justice Scalia. The president vowed to pick someone indisputably qualified. But with battle lines drawn, will that nominee even get a hearing? The Republican senator in charge of any confirmation hearing, Chuck Grassley, appeared to open the door telling Iowa radio I would wait until, the nominee, is made before I would make any decision. But later senator Grassley seemed to backtrack, telling NBC News he is not open to a confirmation. At the Supreme Court this week, remembrances for justice Scalia, his seat draped with black cloth in his honor.

Meanwhile, with conspiracy theories taking off over Scalia's sudden death, law enforcement officials and the owner of the Texas ranch where he died are completely ruling out foul play. Saying a pillow found in his bed was above his head, not over his face, as some reports initially stated. The Scalia vacancy is already a big issue for the 2016 candidates, of course, with each side seeing an historic opportunity to determine the outcome of major issues like abortion and immigration, depending on who is gonna gain the majority in those closely decided 5 to 4 decisions.

    "Reason": "The existing information does not provide sufficient evidence to determine the truthfulness of the claim that President Obama snubbed Justice Scalia's funeral in order to play golf. The video information primarily discusses Obama's response to the need for a Supreme Court nomination following Scalia's death, and there is no mention of Obama attending or not attending the funeral or any golfing activities during that time. Therefore, while the claim may be plausible, the video content lacks direct evidence to support or refute it."

  "Task": "Determine if online information searching is needed to answer the new question. Consider the following criteria:

1. Online search is generally recommended for most questions to provide comprehensive and up-to-date information.
2. If the question can be fully and confidently answered using only the given 'Claim', 'Video_information', and 'QA_CONTEXTS', online search may not be necessary.
3. If the question specifically asks about details or content exclusively present in the video, online search may not be needed.
4. For any question that could benefit from additional context, background, or current information, online search is recommended.

Based on these criteria, determine if online search is needed (Yes or No). If online search could potentially provide any useful information or context, even if not strictly necessary, choose 'Yes'. Only choose 'No' if the question is entirely about specific video content that cannot be found online.

If the result is 'Yes', generate two new queries for Google Custom Search API. If 'No', do not provide any queries.

If generating queries:
- Ensure Query 1 and Query 2 focus on different aspects of the question and are not repetitive.
- Each query should be concise (not exceeding 10 words) and suitable for Google Custom Search API.
- Provide key terms that represent the core focus of each specific query. Key terms must be a single word.

Note: The generated queries should be phrases suitable for Google Search.

1. **www.chicagotribune.com**
   - **Score: 8/10**
   - **Explanation:** The Chicago Tribune is a well-established newspaper with a long history of journalism. It has a reputation for reliable reporting and provides detailed coverage on national and local issues. However, like many mainstream media outlets, it sometimes faces criticism over perceived biases in coverage. Overall, it maintains a solid reputation and is generally trusted for accurate information, especially in legal and political contexts.

2. **www.statesman.com**
   - **Score: 7/10**
   - **Explanation:** The Austin American-Statesman is a regional newspaper based in Texas. It has a decent reputation for covering local news and significant state issues. While the Statesman generally provides thorough reporting, it may not have the same level of national reach or rigorous fact-checking mechanisms as larger national newspapers, which can occasionally affect thoroughness and balance in coverage. Nevertheless, it is a reliable source for local and state news.

3. **www.chicagotribune.com** (duplicate entry)
   - **Score: 8/10**
   - **Explanation:** See above.

4. **rollcall.com**
   - **Score: 8/10**

   - **Score: 8.5/10**
   - **Explanation:** Politico specializes in political news and analysis and is widely regarded for its in-depth coverage of legislative affairs and election news. Its reporting is often timely, and while it may incorporate a few opinion pieces, it maintains a strong commitment to factual accuracy and sourcing.

6. **rollcall.com** (duplicate entry)
   - **Score: 8/10**
   - **Explanation:** See above.

7. **www.nytimes.com**
   - **Score: 9/10**
   - **Explanation:** The New York Times is one of the most prominent newspapers in the world, known for its in-depth reporting and extensive fact-checking processes.

8. **upnorthlive.com**
   - **Score: 6.5/10**
   - **Explanation:** Up North Live is a regional news site based in Michigan. While it covers local news and events, it does not have the robust investigative resources or broad coverage of larger, national news outlets. Accuracy can vary, and it may be less capable of exposing fake news compared to larger, more established organizations. However, it still provides valuable local content.

9. **www.dailynews.com**
   - **Score: 7/10**
   - **Explanation:** The Los Angeles Daily News is a regional publication that covers Southern California news. While it has a history of reporting and provides useful information, its local and regional focus means it may not always have the same depth of analysis for broader national events. It generally maintains reliability, but local biases can affect quality.

10. **www.nydailynews.com**
    - **Score: 7/10**
    - **Explanation:** The New York Daily News offers a mix of news, entertainment, and opinion pieces. While it can provide worthwhile coverage, it is also known for sensationalism at times, impacting its credibility. The Daily News often reports on politics but may not uphold the same journalistic rigor as more established outlets. Overall, it can be trustworthy, but readers should approach it carefully for politically charged reports.

In summary, the evaluations emphasize assessing the reliability and historical accuracy of each outlet, along with their capabilities in exposing and detecting erroneous or misleading information.

1. **www.nytimes.com**
   - **Website Quality: 9/10**
   - **Explanation:** The New York Times is one of the most reputable newspapers in the United States, known for its extensive fact-checking processes and commitment to high journalistic standards.

2. **www.theguardian.com**
   - **Website Quality: 8/10**
   - **Explanation:** The Guardian is an established British news organization with a solid reputation for investigative journalism and in-depth analysis. It maintains editorial independence and emphasizes transparency.

3. **www.washingtonpost.com**
   - **Website Quality: 9/10**
   - **Explanation:** The Washington Post is known for its rigor in reporting and investigative journalism, having broken several major stories in American history. It has a strong editorial and fact-checking staff, giving it a high score for reliability.

4. **www.usatoday.com**
   - **Website Quality: 7/10**
   - **Explanation:** USA Today is a widely read national newspaper that provides information in a straightforward format. While it covers a broad range of topics, its lack of in-depth reporting compared to more investigative outlets can sometimes lead to oversimplifications. However, it generally adheres to journalistic standards and offers reliable news.

5. **www.nydailynews.com**
   - **Website Quality: 6/10**
   - **Explanation:** The New York Daily News is known for its tabloid-style reporting, focusing on sensationalistic headlines and local news. While it does provide news coverage, it often lacks the depth and accuracy associated with more serious outlets. There are instances of misinformation, making it less reliable than higher-rated news organizations.

6. **www.dailynews.com**
   - **Website Quality: 6/10**
   - **Explanation:** Similar to the NY Daily News, Daily News is also focused on sensational stories, often prioritizing entertainment or local reports over detailed political or investigative journalism. Its credibility can vary, and it sometimes promotes less verified information, leading to a moderate quality score.

7. **www.dailymail.co.uk**
   - **Website Quality: 4/10**
   - **Explanation:** The Daily Mail is known for sensationalistic reporting and has faced numerous accusations regarding misinformation and lack of rigorous fact-checking. While it can offer breaking news stories, the quality and accuracy of its content can be inconsistent, making it less reliable as a news source.

8. **www.joshuakennon.com**
   - **Website Quality: 3/10**
   - **Explanation:** This website appears to focus on personal finance and investment topics, and it is not a mainstream news source. The site’s credibility varies significantly depending on the authorship of specific content. Due to its lack of established reputation in journalism and potential biases, it is rated low in quality.

9. **en.wikipedia.org**
   - **Website Quality: 7/10**
   - **Explanation:** Wikipedia is a collaborative online encyclopedia that can provide reliable information but should not be treated as a primary source. Its strength lies in its breadth of information and citations from credible sources, but it is also susceptible to vandalism and bias in some entries, so it is best used as a starting point rather than a definitive source.

10. **twitter.com**
    - **Website Quality: 6/10**
    - **Explanation:** Twitter is a platform for social media reporting and can provide real-time updates, but it lacks editorial control and verification of information. Many credible news organizations share news on Twitter, but misinformation spreads easily, making it necessary to verify information from tweets against reputable sources.

In summary:
- The highest-rated websites rely on strong journalistic integrity and fact-checking, while lower-rated sites may reflect biases or sensationalism that impacts their credibility.

Instead he is sticking with plans to visit Austin, Texas, for seven hours so he can chat onstage at the South by Southwest Interactive festival and appear at two Democratic fundraisers.\\n\u201cSay what you will about President Obama, but it\u2019s hard to argue with the fact he\u2019s probably the most disrespectful and classless individual to ever occupy the White House,\u201d writes Michael Cantrell on the Young Conservatives website. Cantrell then goes on to repeat the debunked claim that Obama skipped Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s funeral to play golf.\\nThat sitting presidents rarely attend the funerals of former first ladies doesn\u2019t seem to matter to the perpetually aggrieved critics of the president. Nor does it matter that Obama is following the examples set by his modern predecessors whose time in office coincides with the instant transmission of news and the arrival of air travel, or that then-President George W.

NBC's Andrea Mitchell has the latest on that. Andrea, good morning. Good morning, Savannah. President Obama is forcefully rejecting Republican calls to let the next president nominate justice Scalia's replacement, even as a handful of Republican senators are now breaking with their leaders and saying the Obama nominee should at least get a fair hearing. The constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now. In California Tuesday, president Obama arguing he will nominate someone for the high court despite calls by Republican leaders that the pick be left to his successor. Historically, this has not been viewed as a question. There's no unwritten law that says that it can only be done on off ears. That's not in the constitutional text. And even some Republicans criticized what appeared to be a rush to the political barricade so soon after justice Scalia's death. This was a misstep. I think it was a political misstep. First off, that is not the first thing you say within hours of the passing of someone like, justice Scalia. The president vowed to pick someone indisputably qualified. But with battle lines drawn, will that nominee even get a hearing? The Republican senator in charge of any confirmation hearing, Chuck Grassley, appeared to open the door telling Iowa radio I would wait until, the nominee, is made before I would make any decision. But later senator Grassley seemed to backtrack, telling NBC News he is not open to a confirmation. At the Supreme Court this week, remembrances for justice Scalia, his seat draped with black cloth in his honor. And on Friday, the justice will return one last time, lying in repose at the court's great hall with a funeral set for Saturday at the basilica of the National Shrine in Washington. Meanwhile, with conspiracy theories taking off over Scalia's sudden death, law enforcement officials and the owner of the Texas ranch where he died are completely ruling out foul play. Saying a pillow found in his bed was above his head, not over his face, as some reports initially stated. The Scalia vacancy is already a big issue for the 2016 candidates, of course, with each side seeing an historic opportunity to determine the outcome of major issues like abortion and immigration, depending on who is gonna gain the majority in those closely decided 5 to 4 decisions. Savannah and Willie.", "Video_descriptor": "The video features a sequence of news-related segments, starting with an older man, potentially a political figure, speaking in a formal setting with a red background and the phrase 'I WOULD WAIT UNTIL THE NOMINEE IS MADE BEFORE I WOULD MAKE ANY DECISIONS,' alongside a 'TODAY' logo. Following this, a composite image reveals a memorial outside a government or institutional building with a lowered American flag. Subsequently, a man in a suit is seen addressing an audience at the 'U.S.-ASEAN LEADERS SUMMIT' about a significant political decision related to a Supreme Court nomination, as indicated by the 'NBC NEWS' overlay. A female news anchor then appears in a studio setting labeled 'NBC NEWS WASHINGTON' discussing 'DECISION 2016'. Another scene captures the American flag at half-mast with mountains in the background, accompanied by 'PRESIDENT'S SUPREME DECISION' news banner and an NBC News timestamp. A close-up shot follows, showing a public figure smiling with a blurred indoor background linked to the President's Supreme Decision news story.

The longest-serving member of the current Supreme Court, Justice Scalia died at age 79 last weekend at a Texas ranch after nearly 30 years on the highest bench.\\nThe funeral, only the second for a sitting justice in more than 60 years, was one of those ritual Washington moments when the perpetual struggle at the intersection of law and politics is briefly suspended to honor one of the capital\u2019s most celebrated and cheerfully controversial gladiators.

Father Paul told how his father \u2013 the first Italian-American appointed to the supreme court \u2013 felt affection for the church\u2019s tradition, and also preached about how that faith played a role in his father\u2019s career on court, which he served for three decades.\\n\u201cI hope that it is some consolation, if there are any lawyers present, that the Roman collar was not a shield against his criticism,\u201d he said.\\nHe noted Scalia\u2019s 55 years of marriage to \u201ca woman who could match him at every step and even hold him accountable\u201d.

Very sad that he did not go!\u201d\\nThe mass was full of the majesty and spectacle of the American Catholic church. The foundation stone of the National Shrine was laid in 1920. Gorgeous ceiling mosaics and stained glass windows depict biblical scenes. The two-hour funeral mass began and ended with the swinging of incense and carrying of a gold crucifix as the building resounded with singing and organ music.\\nScalia\u2019s sons and sons-in-law served as pallbearers to carry his flag-draped casket.

2024-08-01 21:53:31 - ThreadPoolExecutor-0_0 - INFO - Here are the relevance scores and justifications for each piece of evidence in relation to the question of whether President Obama prioritized golf over attending Justice Scalia's funeral:

1. **evidence0**  
   **RelevanceScore**: 8, justification: This article discusses Obama's decision to skip Scalia's funeral, noting that he is criticized for not attending and emphasizes his identity as a "Chicago guy." While it does not directly mention golf, the context suggests he chose other commitments over the funeral, aligning with the claim about prioritization.

2. **evidence1**  
   **RelevanceScore**: 4, justification: This evidence relates to general criticisms of Obama's attendance at funerals, but it does not specifically address the Scalia funeral or indicate that golf was a reason for skipping it. It focuses more on the historical context of presidential funeral attendance, making it somewhat relevant but lacking direct acknowledgment of golf.

3. **evidence2**  
   **RelevanceScore**: 3, justification: Similar to evidence1, this evidence critiques Obama's absence at funerals, including Scalia's, but does not substantiate the claim that he prioritized golf. It mentions public perception but lacks specific relevance to golf or the rationale for his attendance choices.

4. **evidence3**  
   **RelevanceScore**: 9, justification: This evidence explicitly mentions that Obama chose not to attend Scalia's funeral while Vice President Biden would attend instead. It implies that Obama decided to bow out out of respect and does not mention golf as a competing interest, addressing the claim directly in terms of prioritization regarding the funeral.

5. **evidence4**  
   **RelevanceScore**: 5, justification: This mentions the absence of Scalia's family during an encounter with Obama but does not focus directly on the claim about missing Scalia's funeral for golf. It is tangentially related but does not provide significant clarity on the situation.

6. **evidence5**  
   **RelevanceScore**: 2, justification: This relates more to Obama's absence from Nancy Reagan's funeral and does not discuss Scalia's situation, nor does it mention golf directly. Thus, it offers limited relevance to the current question.

7. **evidence6**  
   **RelevanceScore**: 10, justification: This New York Times article comprehensively discusses the fallout from Obama's decision not to attend Scalia's funeral. It underscores the decision as a political and respectful choice, concisely addressing questions surrounding appropriateness and the context of his attendance alternatives, confirming that golf was not a factor.

8. **evidence7**  
   **RelevanceScore**: 9, justification: This evidence notes that Obama and the First Lady paid respects to Scalia as he lay in repose but did not attend the funeral. It clarifies that Obama was respectful in his absence, implicitly disputing the prioritization of golf without confirming it as a reason for missing the funeral.

9. **evidence8**  
   **RelevanceScore**: 6, justification: Although it connects to general criticism regarding Obama's absence from funerals, it mentions Scalia's funeral in passing, and though it does not reference golf, it touches on public reaction but lacks depth regarding the claim.

10. **evidence9**  
    **RelevanceScore**: 0, justification: This evidence has no relevance to Obama's decisions regarding Scalia's funeral and instead reflects on a different incident involving Trump, making it completely unrelated to the current question.

In summary, the evidence varies in relevance regarding the claim, with some strongly supporting or contradicting the assertion that Obama prioritized golf over attendance at Justice Scalia's funeral.

2024-08-01 21:53:39 - ThreadPoolExecutor-0_1 - INFO - 1. **evidence0**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 6
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses the funeral of Justice Scalia and mentions that President Obama paid his respects while Scalia lay in repose. However, it does not directly address whether Obama prioritized golf over attending the funeral, making it somewhat relevant but lacking specific ties to the claim.

2. **evidence1**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 7
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses the attendance of various political figures at Scalia's funeral and implies the absence of President Obama. It raises the question about his attendance in relation to his priorities, but does not explicitly link his absence to playing golf. It provides context about political reactions but indirectly addresses the claim.

3. **evidence2**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 4
   - **Justification**: This evidence focuses on the circumstances surrounding Scalia's death and does not relate to Obama's attendance at his funeral. It does not provide any relevant information about the claim regarding Obama's priorities, thus making it minimally relevant.

4. **evidence3**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 5
   - **Justification**: This evidence mentions that President Obama stayed at the White House instead of attending Scalia's funeral but does not address the claim about golfing specifically. It implies a political context but lacks direct relevance to the question of whether he prioritized golf.

5. **evidence4**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 1
   - **Justification**: This evidence is unrelated to the claim regarding Obama and Scalia's funeral, as it discusses a different context regarding school shooting victims. Therefore, it does not provide any relevance to the evaluation of Obama’s priorities.

6. **evidence5**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 8
   - **Justification**: This evidence directly addresses the criticism Obama faced for not attending Scalia's funeral and compares it to his absence at another event, providing context about the controversy. It relates closely to the implications of prioritizing commitments over significant national events.

7. **evidence6**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 9
   - **Justification**: This evidence explicitly highlights Donald Trump's criticism of Obama for not attending Scalia's funeral and questions whether Obama's absence would have differed if the service were held in a mosque. This is highly relevant to the claim and discussions about priorities regarding golfing versus attending the funeral.

8. **evidence7**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 2
   - **Justification**: This evidence does pose a rhetorical question regarding Obama's golfing commitments in the context of Scalia's funeral, but it does not provide factual information or context, making it very weakly relevant to the claim.

9. **evidence8**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 0
   - **Justification**: This evidence is unrelated to the topic at hand, discussing a different subject completely. No relevant information regarding Obama or Scalia’s funeral is presented.

10. **evidence9**:
    - **RelevanceScore**: 0
    - **Justification**: This evidence comes from a Twitter post unrelated to the topic. It does not discuss Obama, Scalia, or any pertinent context, making it irrelevant to the evaluation of the claim.

  "video_transcript": "And now to the heated debate over replacing supreme court justice Antonin Scalia, president Obama now waging into the Republican opposition against him naming Scalia successor. NBC's Andrea Mitchell has the latest on that. Andrea, good morning. Good morning, Savannah. President Obama is forcefully rejecting Republican calls to let the next president nominate justice Scalia's replacement, even as a handful of Republican senators are now breaking with their leaders and saying the Obama nominee should at least get a fair hearing. The constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now. In California Tuesday, president Obama arguing he will nominate someone for the high court despite calls by Republican leaders that the pick be left to his successor. Historically, this has not been viewed as a question. There's no unwritten law that says that it can only be done on off ears. That's not in the constitutional text. And even some Republicans criticized what appeared to be a rush to the political barricade so soon after justice Scalia's death. This was a misstep. I think it was a political misstep. First off, that is not the first thing you say within hours of the passing of someone like, justice Scalia. The president vowed to pick someone indisputably qualified. But with battle lines drawn, will that nominee even get a hearing? The Republican senator in charge of any confirmation hearing, Chuck Grassley, appeared to open the door telling Iowa radio I would wait until, the nominee, is made before I would make any decision. But later senator Grassley seemed to backtrack, telling NBC News he is not open to a confirmation. At the Supreme Court this week, remembrances for justice Scalia, his seat draped with black cloth in his honor. And on Friday, the justice will return one last time, lying in repose at the court's great hall with a funeral set for Saturday at the basilica of the National Shrine in Washington. Meanwhile, with conspiracy theories taking off over Scalia's sudden death, law enforcement officials and the owner of the Texas ranch where he died are completely ruling out foul play. Saying a pillow found in his bed was above his head, not over his face, as some reports initially stated. The Scalia vacancy is already a big issue for the 2016 candidates, of course, with each side seeing an historic opportunity to determine the outcome of major issues like abortion and immigration, depending on who is gonna gain the majority in those closely decided 5 to 4 decisions. Savannah and Willie.",
  "Video_descriptor": "The video features a sequence of news-related segments, starting with an older man, potentially a political figure, speaking in a formal setting with a red background and the phrase 'I WOULD WAIT UNTIL THE NOMINEE IS MADE BEFORE I WOULD MAKE ANY DECISIONS,' alongside a 'TODAY' logo. Following this, a composite image reveals a memorial outside a government or institutional building with a lowered American flag. Subsequently, a man in a suit is seen addressing an audience at the 'U.S.-ASEAN LEADERS SUMMIT' about a significant political decision related to a Supreme Court nomination, as indicated by the 'NBC NEWS' overlay. A female news anchor then appears in a studio setting labeled 'NBC NEWS WASHINGTON' discussing 'DECISION 2016'. Another scene captures the American flag at half-mast with mountains in the background, accompanied by 'PRESIDENT'S SUPREME DECISION' news banner and an NBC News timestamp. A close-up shot follows, showing a public figure smiling with a blurred indoor background linked to the President's Supreme Decision news story. Lastly, a cathedral-like structure with a news banner highlighting 'PRESIDENT'S SUPREME DECISION' and 'Obama Pledges to Move Ahead with SCOTUS Nomination' is displayed without any visible individuals."

    "content": "Advertisement\nSupported by\nBy Gardiner Harris\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House on Thursday tried to fend off criticism of President Obama\u2019s decision not to attend the funeral this weekend of Justice Antonin Scalia, but even some administration allies lamented the move as a missed opportunity to ease the partisan warfare that has followed the justice\u2019s death.\nMr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, will pay their respects by visiting the Supreme Court on Friday, when Justice Scalia will lie in repose in the Great Hall. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is Catholic \u2014 as was Justice Scalia \u2014 and had a personal relationship with him and his family, will attend the funeral on Saturday at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception along with his wife, Jill.\nFacing questions again on Thursday about the decision, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, did not offer a direct answer but implied that one reason was the potential for the extensive presidential security detail to be disruptive.\n\u201cObviously, when the vice president travels to some place, his security footprint is at least a little bit lighter,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. \u201cBut given his personal relationship with the family and given the president\u2019s desire to find a respectful way to pay tribute to Justice Scalia\u2019s service to the country, we believe we have settled on an appropriate and respectful arrangement.\u201d\nThe empty seat left by Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death leaves the court with two basic options for cases left on the docket this term if the justices are deadlocked at 4 to 4.\nAdministration officials were stung by what they saw as an unfair attack on what they viewed as Mr. Obama\u2019s dignified and respectful reaction to Justice Scalia\u2019s death, a reaction they thought contrasted sharply with that of others in Washington who quickly politicized the loss. \nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

It highlights that Obama attended a viewing at the Supreme Court but did not attend the funeral, instead sending Vice President Biden. The reasons provided include considerations of respect for Scalia's family wishes and potential security issues, rather than prioritizing golf or recreational activities. This directly addresses the question of whether Obama prioritized golf over Scalia's funeral."

NBC's Andrea Mitchell has the latest on that. Andrea, good morning. Good morning, Savannah. President Obama is forcefully rejecting Republican calls to let the next president nominate justice Scalia's replacement, even as a handful of Republican senators are now breaking with their leaders and saying the Obama nominee should at least get a fair hearing. The constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now. In California Tuesday, president Obama arguing he will nominate someone for the high court despite calls by Republican leaders that the pick be left to his successor. Historically, this has not been viewed as a question. There's no unwritten law that says that it can only be done on off ears. That's not in the constitutional text. And even some Republicans criticized what appeared to be a rush to the political barricade so soon after justice Scalia's death. This was a misstep. I think it was a political misstep. First off, that is not the first thing you say within hours of the passing of someone like, justice Scalia. The president vowed to pick someone indisputably qualified. But with battle lines drawn, will that nominee even get a hearing? The Republican senator in charge of any confirmation hearing, Chuck Grassley, appeared to open the door telling Iowa radio I would wait until, the nominee, is made before I would make any decision. But later senator Grassley seemed to backtrack, telling NBC News he is not open to a confirmation. At the Supreme Court this week, remembrances for justice Scalia, his seat draped with black cloth in his honor. And on Friday, the justice will return one last time, lying in repose at the court's great hall with a funeral set for Saturday at the basilica of the National Shrine in Washington. Meanwhile, with conspiracy theories taking off over Scalia's sudden death, law enforcement officials and the owner of the Texas ranch where he died are completely ruling out foul play. Saying a pillow found in his bed was above his head, not over his face, as some reports initially stated. The Scalia vacancy is already a big issue for the 2016 candidates, of course, with each side seeing an historic opportunity to determine the outcome of major issues like abortion and immigration, depending on who is gonna gain the majority in those closely decided 5 to 4 decisions.

2024-08-01 21:54:12 - Thread-1 (process_claim_verification) - INFO - Based on the evidence, President Obama did not prioritize golf over attending Justice Scalia's funeral. Instead, he decided to skip the funeral due to the perception of it being a private event intended for family and close friends, while instead paying his respects by visiting the Supreme Court where Justice Scalia lay in repose.

The evidence indicates that this decision was not politically motivated, but rather a matter of respect for Justice Scalia’s privacy. Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, commented that the announcement for the mass indicated it was for "friends and family members," and that Obama does not fit into either category, suggesting that his absence from the funeral was respectful, not dismissive [Query1_evidence2·]. Additionally, the White House explained that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president might have disrupted the funeral, which further informed their decision [Query1_evidence1·].

In conclusion, there is no substantial video evidence or context suggesting Obama was prioritizing golf over attending the funeral; the decision appears to stem from a complex interplay of respect for the deceased and logistical considerations surrounding a presidential appearance. Therefore, I am confident in saying that Obama did not prioritize golf in this situation, with a confidence level of 85%.

    "Reason": "The existing information suggests that President Obama did not prioritize golf over attending Justice Scalia's funeral. Instead, he chose not to attend due to the perception that the funeral was a private event for family and close friends, and consequently he paid his respects by visiting the Supreme Court where Scalia lay in repose. While the White House cited logistical considerations and the potential disruption caused by a sitting president's security detail, there is no explicit evidence presented in the provided information that confirms the claim directly. The initial question indicates that the absence was respectful rather than dismissive or motivated by a desire to play golf. However, the conclusion cannot be definitively reached based solely on the provided information, leading to a cautious judgment of 'No' for the claim being definitively proven untrue. The confidence level remains at 75% due to the strong supportive context but acknowledges some ambiguity regarding the final conclusions drawn from the events."

  "Task": "Determine if online information searching is needed to answer the new question. Consider the following criteria:

1. Online search is generally recommended for most questions to provide comprehensive and up-to-date information.
2. If the question can be fully and confidently answered using only the given 'Claim', 'Video_information', and 'QA_CONTEXTS', online search may not be necessary.
3. If the question specifically asks about details or content exclusively present in the video, online search may not be needed.
4. For any question that could benefit from additional context, background, or current information, online search is recommended.

Based on these criteria, determine if online search is needed (Yes or No). If online search could potentially provide any useful information or context, even if not strictly necessary, choose 'Yes'. Only choose 'No' if the question is entirely about specific video content that cannot be found online.

If the result is 'Yes', generate two new queries for Google Custom Search API. If 'No', do not provide any queries.

If generating queries:
- Ensure Query 1 and Query 2 focus on different aspects of the question and are not repetitive.
- Each query should be concise (not exceeding 10 words) and suitable for Google Custom Search API.
- Provide key terms that represent the core focus of each specific query. Key terms must be a single word.

Note: The generated queries should be phrases suitable for Google Search.

NBC's Andrea Mitchell has the latest on that. Andrea, good morning. Good morning, Savannah. President Obama is forcefully rejecting Republican calls to let the next president nominate justice Scalia's replacement, even as a handful of Republican senators are now breaking with their leaders and saying the Obama nominee should at least get a fair hearing. The constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now. In California Tuesday, president Obama arguing he will nominate someone for the high court despite calls by Republican leaders that the pick be left to his successor.

First off, that is not the first thing you say within hours of the passing of someone like, justice Scalia. The president vowed to pick someone indisputably qualified. But with battle lines drawn, will that nominee even get a hearing? The Republican senator in charge of any confirmation hearing, Chuck Grassley, appeared to open the door telling Iowa radio I would wait until, the nominee, is made before I would make any decision.

Meanwhile, with conspiracy theories taking off over Scalia's sudden death, law enforcement officials and the owner of the Texas ranch where he died are completely ruling out foul play. Saying a pillow found in his bed was above his head, not over his face, as some reports initially stated.

Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, commented that the announcement for the mass indicated it was for "friends and family members," and that Obama does not fit into either category, suggesting that his absence from the funeral was respectful, not dismissive. Additionally, the White House explained that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president might have disrupted the funeral, which further informed their decision.

2. **nypost.com**
   - **Score**: 6/10
   - **Explanation**: The New York Post is a prominent tabloid newspaper that sometimes engages in sensationalism.

It has a mixed reputation for accuracy, which warrants a mid-range score.

3. **rollcall.com**
   - **Score**: 7/10
   - **Explanation**: Roll Call primarily focuses on congressional news and has established a reputation for accuracy in politics reporting. It offers insights and analyses relevant to legislative happenings and is better regarded than many other political gossip outlets.

6. **www.jacksonville.com**
   - **Score**: 6/10
   - **Explanation**: Jacksonville.com has regional significance but may not have the same level of extensive coverage or editorial scrutiny as larger national outlets. Its local reporting is useful for those interested in specific community-related news, but it may lack in-depth national political analysis. Thus, it receives a moderate score.

7. **www.theguardian.com**
   - **Score**: 9/10
   - **Explanation**: The Guardian is an internationally recognized publication known for its investigative journalism and comprehensive analysis. Despite facing accusations of bias in certain areas, it has a robust fact-checking process and is known for exposing misinformation. Its journalistic integrity generally earns it a high rating.

8. **www.politico.com**

While it is generally considered reliable, it has been critiqued for occasionally presenting news with a partisan slant. Nevertheless, its insights into political processes and events are valuable, which keeps it in a high credibility range.

9. **www.nytimes.com**
   - **Score**: 9/10
   - **Explanation**: The New York Times is esteemed for its rigorous journalism and in-depth coverage of news events globally. It has significant resources dedicated to fact-checking and maintaining high-quality standards across its reporting.

NBC's Andrea Mitchell has the latest on that. Andrea, good morning. Good morning, Savannah. President Obama is forcefully rejecting Republican calls to let the next president nominate justice Scalia's replacement, even as a handful of Republican senators are now breaking with their leaders and saying the Obama nominee should at least get a fair hearing. The constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now. In California Tuesday, president Obama arguing he will nominate someone for the high court despite calls by Republican leaders that the pick be left to his successor. Historically, this has not been viewed as a question. There's no unwritten law that says that it can only be done on off ears. That's not in the constitutional text. And even some Republicans criticized what appeared to be a rush to the political barricade so soon after justice Scalia's death. This was a misstep. I think it was a political misstep. First off, that is not the first thing you say within hours of the passing of someone like, justice Scalia. The president vowed to pick someone indisputably qualified. But with battle lines drawn, will that nominee even get a hearing? The Republican senator in charge of any confirmation hearing, Chuck Grassley, appeared to open the door telling Iowa radio I would wait until, the nominee, is made before I would make any decision. But later senator Grassley seemed to backtrack, telling NBC News he is not open to a confirmation. At the Supreme Court this week, remembrances for justice Scalia, his seat draped with black cloth in his honor. And on Friday, the justice will return one last time, lying in repose at the court's great hall with a funeral set for Saturday at the basilica of the National Shrine in Washington. Meanwhile, with conspiracy theories taking off over Scalia's sudden death, law enforcement officials and the owner of the Texas ranch where he died are completely ruling out foul play. Saying a pillow found in his bed was above his head, not over his face, as some reports initially stated. The Scalia vacancy is already a big issue for the 2016 candidates, of course, with each side seeing an historic opportunity to determine the outcome of major issues like abortion and immigration, depending on who is gonna gain the majority in those closely decided 5 to 4 decisions.

Instead, he decided to skip the funeral due to the perception of it being a private event intended for family and close friends, while instead paying his respects by visiting the Supreme Court where Justice Scalia lay in repose. The evidence indicates that this decision was not politically motivated, but rather a matter of respect for Justice Scalia’s privacy. Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, commented that the announcement for the mass indicated it was for "friends and family members," and that Obama does not fit into either category, suggesting that his absence from the funeral was respectful, not dismissive. Additionally, the White House explained that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president might have disrupted the funeral, which further informed their decision. In conclusion, there is no substantial video evidence or context suggesting Obama was prioritizing golf over attending the funeral; the decision appears to stem from a complex interplay of respect for the deceased and logistical considerations surrounding a presidential appearance.', 'Confidence': '85%'}},

2024-08-01 21:56:26 - ThreadPoolExecutor-1_0 - INFO - ### Evaluation of Evidence Relevance

**evidence0**
- **RelevanceScore**: 10
- **Justification**: This evidence directly addresses the official reasons given by the White House for President Obama's absence from Justice Scalia's funeral. It outlines that Obama chose to pay his respects at the Supreme Court where Scalia lay in repose and includes the statement from White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, emphasizing respect and the need to avoid disruption due to presidential security. This information is crucial for evaluating the claim that Obama prioritized golf over attending the funeral.

**evidence1**
- **RelevanceScore**: 6
- **Justification**: This evidence discusses the criticism Obama faced for missing the funeral but does not provide specific official reasons from the White House. It mentions that Biden attended in his place but lacks detailed context for why Obama made that decision. While it adds to the picture of public perception, it does not significantly clarify the reasons for his absence.

**evidence2**
- **RelevanceScore**: 9
- **Justification**: This evidence contains insights from Barbara Perry, who explains that the funeral was intended for friends and family, indicating that Obama may not have fit this category. Additionally, it explains that his absence was based on respect rather than a political statement, which supports the White House's rationale. It reinforces the notion that the absence was not dismissive and is helpful for understanding the context around the claim.

**evidence3**
- **RelevanceScore**: 5
- **Justification**: This evidence mentions the controversy surrounding Obama's absence but does not provide official reasons from the White House. It reflects on public reactions to his absence but lacks direct relevance to the question of stated reasons, thus offering limited value in clarifying the initial claim.

**evidence4**
- **RelevanceScore**: 4
- **Justification**: This evidence briefly mentions Obama's absence and the historical context of presidential attendance at funerals but fails to provide specific reasons from the White House for his decision. It offers minimal direct relevance to answering the current question.

**evidence5**
- **RelevanceScore**: 8
- **Justification**: This evidence discusses reasons for Obama's absence and mentions the rarity of a sitting president skipping such events. It highlights the White House's sentiment about honoring Scalia without causing disruption. This information is quite relevant as it addresses the decision directly and helps contextualize the official stance.

**evidence6**
- **RelevanceScore**: 3
- **Justification**: This evidence provides some context about the funeral service but does not focus on the White House's official reasoning for Obama's absence. It captures public sentiment but lacks critical details relevant to the question of Obama's stated reasons.

**evidence7**
- **RelevanceScore**: 2
- **Justification**: This evidence is very limited in scope, mentioning a brief meeting with Scalia's son but not providing substantive context about why Obama did not attend the funeral. It has minimal relevance to answering the question at hand.

**evidence8**
- **RelevanceScore**: 7
- **Justification**: This evidence discusses the criticism of Obama's absence and the White House's positioning, hinting at potential misinterpretations of his intent. It lays some groundwork for understanding official sentiment but is not as focused on specific reasoning, thus receiving a moderate score.

**evidence9**
- **RelevanceScore**: 1
- **Justification**: This evidence mentions the attendance of others at the funeral but does not provide information regarding the official reasons for Obama's absence. It does not contribute to answering the question or understanding the White House's rationale.

Overall, evidence with direct statements related to the White House's official rationale and context regarding respect and logistics received higher scores, while evidence that strayed too far from those themes was rated lower.

   - **Score:** 9/10
   - **Explanation:** The official White House website is a primary source for information regarding the actions and statements of the President and administration. It maintains a high level of credibility and reliability, as it directly communicates with the public regarding official matters. However, it may present information in a way that aligns with the current administration's perspective, which could introduce some bias. Overall, it is still one of the most accurate sources for understanding government conduct.

2. **www.politico.com**
   - **Score:** 8/10
   - **Explanation:** Politico is recognized as a reputable news organization that focuses on politics and policy. It offers in-depth analyses and detailed reporting on important political events. While it has a solid reputation, some critics argue that it sometimes leans towards a particular political bias. However, its commitment to fact-checking and reporting on political matters earns it a high score for credibility.

3. **rollcall.com**
   - **Score:** 7/10
   - **Explanation:** Roll Call is a long-standing publication that specializes in political news, particularly covering Congress. Its depth of coverage makes it a valuable resource; however, like many news sources, it can exhibit some bias based on ownership or editorial choices. Its historical focus and experience in legislative matters help maintain its credibility, but it is slightly less well-known than some other competing sources.

4. **georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov**
   - **Score:** 8/10
   - **Explanation:** The archived official website of George W. Bush’s presidency is a reliable historical resource for information on policies and actions taken during his time in office. While it focuses on past administration activities, it can be helpful in understanding political contexts. Its reliability stems from being an official government source, although it may lack in real-time updates as it is not actively maintained for current events.

5. **twitter.com**
   - **Score:** 6/10
   - **Explanation:** While Twitter is a widely used social media platform for news dissemination, it is also prone to the rapid spread of misinformation. Users can share content without verification, making it necessary for individuals to critically evaluate the credibility of sources shared on this platform. Therefore, while it is a useful tool to gauge public sentiment and immediate reactions, it requires careful discernment to assess its credibility.

"Claim": "President Obama snubbed the funeral of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in order to play golf.",
"Video_information": {"video_date": 20160217.0, "platform": "nbcnews", "video_headline": "Obama speaks out on battle to fill Scalia's seat", "video_transcript": "And now to the heated debate over replacing supreme court justice Antonin Scalia, president Obama now waging into the Republican opposition against him naming Scalia successor. NBC's Andrea Mitchell has the latest on that. Andrea, good morning. Good morning, Savannah. President Obama is forcefully rejecting Republican calls to let the next president nominate justice Scalia's replacement, even as a handful of Republican senators are now breaking with their leaders and saying the Obama nominee should at least get a fair hearing. The constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now. In California Tuesday, president Obama arguing he will nominate someone for the high court despite calls by Republican leaders that the pick be left to his successor. Historically, this has not been viewed as a question. There's no unwritten law that says that it can only be done on off ears. That's not in the constitutional text. And even some Republicans criticized what appeared to be a rush to the political barricade so soon after justice Scalia's death. This was a misstep. I think it was a political misstep. First off, that is not the first thing you say within hours of the passing of someone like, justice Scalia. The president vowed to pick someone indisputably qualified. But with battle lines drawn, will that nominee even get a hearing? The Republican senator in charge of any confirmation hearing, Chuck Grassley, appeared to open the door telling Iowa radio I would wait until, the nominee, is made before I would make any decision. But later senator Grassley seemed to backtrack, telling NBC News he is not open to a confirmation. At the Supreme Court this week, remembrances for justice Scalia, his seat draped with black cloth in his honor. And on Friday, the justice will return one last time, lying in repose at the court's great hall with a funeral set for Saturday at the basilica of the National Shrine in Washington. Meanwhile, with conspiracy theories taking off over Scalia's sudden death, law enforcement officials and the owner of the Texas ranch where he died are completely ruling out foul play. Saying a pillow found in his bed was above his head, not over his face, as some reports initially stated. The Scalia vacancy is already a big issue for the 2016 candidates, of course, with each side seeing an historic opportunity to determine the outcome of major issues like abortion and immigration, depending on who is gonna gain the majority in those closely decided 5 to 4 decisions. Savannah and Willie.", "Video_descriptor": "The video features a sequence of news-related segments, starting with an older man, potentially a political figure, speaking in a formal setting with a red background and the phrase 'I WOULD WAIT UNTIL THE NOMINEE IS MADE BEFORE I WOULD MAKE ANY DECISIONS,' alongside a 'TODAY' logo. Following this, a composite image reveals a memorial outside a government or institutional building with a lowered American flag. Subsequently, a man in a suit is seen addressing an audience at the 'U.S.-ASEAN LEADERS SUMMIT' about a significant political decision related to a Supreme Court nomination, as indicated by the 'NBC NEWS' overlay. A female news anchor then appears in a studio setting labeled 'NBC NEWS WASHINGTON' discussing 'DECISION 2016'. Another scene captures the American flag at half-mast with mountains in the background, accompanied by 'PRESIDENT'S SUPREME DECISION' news banner and an NBC News timestamp. A close-up shot follows, showing a public figure smiling with a blurred indoor background linked to the President's Supreme Decision news story. Lastly, a cathedral-like structure with a news banner highlighting 'PRESIDENT'S SUPREME DECISION' and 'Obama Pledges to Move Ahead with SCOTUS Nomination' is displayed without any visible individuals."},
"QA_CONTEXTS": {"Initial_Question_Generation": {"Question": "Did President Obama prioritize golf over attending Justice Scalia's funeral based on video evidence?", "Answer": "Based on the evidence, President Obama did not prioritize golf over attending Justice Scalia's funeral. Instead, he decided to skip the funeral due to the perception of it being a private event intended for family and close friends, while instead paying his respects by visiting the Supreme Court where Justice Scalia lay in repose. The evidence indicates that this decision was not politically motivated, but rather a matter of respect for Justice Scalia\u2019s privacy. Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, commented that the announcement for the mass indicated it was for \"friends and family members,\" and that Obama does not fit into either category, suggesting that his absence from the funeral was respectful, not dismissive. Additionally, the White House explained that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president might have disrupted the funeral, which further informed their decision. In conclusion, there is no substantial video evidence or context suggesting Obama was prioritizing golf over attending the funeral; the decision appears to stem from a complex interplay of respect for the deceased and logistical considerations surrounding a presidential appearance.", "Confidence": "85%"}},

   - **RelevanceScore**: 1, 
   - **Justification**: The content of this evidence does not address President Obama's absence from Justice Scalia's funeral or provide any relevant information about the reasons behind the absence. It discusses a completely unrelated topic, thereby making it irrelevant to the current question.

2. **evidence1**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 6, 
   - **Justification**: This evidence briefly mentions a statement from White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest regarding the Obama's absence from the funeral and indicates some commentary on the family's absence.

8. **evidence7**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 1, 
   - **Justification**: This evidence relates to President Trump's absence from John McCain's funeral, which has no relevance to President Obama or the reasoning for his absence from Justice Scalia's funeral.

   - **RelevanceScore**: 1, 
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death and funeral and does not provide information on President Obama's absence from Scalia's funeral. Thus, it is not relevant.

  "video_headline": "Obama speaks out on battle to fill Scalia's seat",
  "video_transcript": "And now to the heated debate over replacing supreme court justice Antonin Scalia, president Obama now waging into the Republican opposition against him naming Scalia successor. NBC's Andrea Mitchell has the latest on that. Andrea, good morning. Good morning, Savannah. President Obama is forcefully rejecting Republican calls to let the next president nominate justice Scalia's replacement, even as a handful of Republican senators are now breaking with their leaders and saying the Obama nominee should at least get a fair hearing. The constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now. In California Tuesday, president Obama arguing he will nominate someone for the high court despite calls by Republican leaders that the pick be left to his successor. Historically, this has not been viewed as a question. There's no unwritten law that says that it can only be done on off ears. That's not in the constitutional text. And even some Republicans criticized what appeared to be a rush to the political barricade so soon after justice Scalia's death. This was a misstep. I think it was a political misstep. First off, that is not the first thing you say within hours of the passing of someone like, justice Scalia. The president vowed to pick someone indisputably qualified. But with battle lines drawn, will that nominee even get a hearing? The Republican senator in charge of any confirmation hearing, Chuck Grassley, appeared to open the door telling Iowa radio I would wait until, the nominee, is made before I would make any decision. But later senator Grassley seemed to backtrack, telling NBC News he is not open to a confirmation. At the Supreme Court this week, remembrances for justice Scalia, his seat draped with black cloth in his honor. And on Friday, the justice will return one last time, lying in repose at the court's great hall with a funeral set for Saturday at the basilica of the National Shrine in Washington. Meanwhile, with conspiracy theories taking off over Scalia's sudden death, law enforcement officials and the owner of the Texas ranch where he died are completely ruling out foul play. Saying a pillow found in his bed was above his head, not over his face, as some reports initially stated. The Scalia vacancy is already a big issue for the 2016 candidates, of course, with each side seeing an historic opportunity to determine the outcome of major issues like abortion and immigration, depending on who is gonna gain the majority in those closely decided 5 to 4 decisions. Savannah and Willie.",
  "Video_descriptor": "The video features a sequence of news-related segments, starting with an older man, potentially a political figure, speaking in a formal setting with a red background and the phrase 'I WOULD WAIT UNTIL THE NOMINEE IS MADE BEFORE I WOULD MAKE ANY DECISIONS,' alongside a 'TODAY' logo. Following this, a composite image reveals a memorial outside a government or institutional building with a lowered American flag. Subsequently, a man in a suit is seen addressing an audience at the 'U.S.-ASEAN LEADERS SUMMIT' about a significant political decision related to a Supreme Court nomination, as indicated by the 'NBC NEWS' overlay. A female news anchor then appears in a studio setting labeled 'NBC NEWS WASHINGTON' discussing 'DECISION 2016'. Another scene captures the American flag at half-mast with mountains in the background, accompanied by 'PRESIDENT'S SUPREME DECISION' news banner and an NBC News timestamp. A close-up shot follows, showing a public figure smiling with a blurred indoor background linked to the President's Supreme Decision news story. Lastly, a cathedral-like structure with a news banner highlighting 'PRESIDENT'S SUPREME DECISION' and 'Obama Pledges to Move Ahead with SCOTUS Nomination' is displayed without any visible individuals."

  "Initial_Question_Generation": {
    "Question": "Did President Obama prioritize golf over attending Justice Scalia's funeral based on video evidence?",
    "Answer": "Based on the evidence, President Obama did not prioritize golf over attending Justice Scalia's funeral. Instead, he decided to skip the funeral due to the perception of it being a private event intended for family and close friends, while instead paying his respects by visiting the Supreme Court where Justice Scalia lay in repose. The evidence indicates that this decision was not politically motivated, but rather a matter of respect for Justice Scalia\u2019s privacy. Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, commented that the announcement for the mass indicated it was for \"friends and family members,\" and that Obama does not fit into either category, suggesting that his absence from the funeral was respectful, not dismissive. Additionally, the White House explained that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president might have disrupted the funeral, which further informed their decision. In conclusion, there is no substantial video evidence or context suggesting Obama was prioritizing golf over attending the funeral; the decision appears to stem from a complex interplay of respect for the deceased and logistical considerations surrounding a presidential appearance.",

        "Question": "Did President Obama prioritize golf over attending Justice Scalia's funeral based on video evidence?",
        "Answer": "Based on the evidence, President Obama did not prioritize golf over attending Justice Scalia's funeral. Instead, he decided to skip the funeral due to the perception of it being a private event intended for family and close friends, while instead paying his respects by visiting the Supreme Court where Justice Scalia lay in repose. The evidence indicates that this decision was not politically motivated, but rather a matter of respect for Justice Scalia’s privacy. Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, commented that the announcement for the mass indicated it was for \"friends and family members,\" and that Obama does not fit into either category, suggesting that his absence from the funeral was respectful, not dismissive. Additionally, the White House explained that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president might have disrupted the funeral, which further informed their decision. In conclusion, there is no substantial video evidence or context suggesting Obama was prioritizing golf over attending the funeral; the decision appears to stem from a complex interplay of respect for the deceased and logistical considerations surrounding a presidential appearance.",

For others, showing up was an affirmation of conservative bona fides and membership in this city’s power elite.\nWuerl name-checked a few VIPs in attendance: Chief Justice John G.

Conservatives loudly criticized President Obama for snubbing the longest-sitting justice when the White House announced he would not attend. Rejecting the notion that the decision was political, press secretary Josh Earnest defended sending Biden as “somebody that had his own personal relationship with Justice Scalia and his family.” What’s more, he said, Biden’s security footprint would be less disruptive. “We believe we have settled on an appropriate and respectful arrangement,” he said.\nMourners pay respects to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia\nScalia is laid to rest at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington.\nThe president and first lady , when Scalia's body lay in repose in the Great Hall of the Supreme Court.\nIt’s rare for a justice to die in office, so there’s little precedent for presidential attendance.

2024-08-01 21:57:47 - Thread-1 (process_claim_verification) - INFO - The official reasons given by the White House for President Obama's absence from Justice Scalia's funeral include the following:

1. **Paying Respects at the Supreme Court**: The White House confirmed that President Obama would pay his respects on the day prior to the funeral, when Scalia’s body was lying in repose at the Great Hall of the Supreme Court. This was considered an appropriate way for the president to honor Justice Scalia, according to White House spokesperson Josh Earnest, who stated, "the president will pay his respects at the Supreme Court on Friday" [Query 1_evidence 1].

2. **Respect for the Funeral's Intimacy**: Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, noted that the funeral was described as a service for "friends and family members," and argued that since President Obama does not fit into either of those categories, his absence was respectful rather than dismissive. She emphasized that Justice Scalia was a private person who likely would not have wanted the spectacle that would accompany a presidential attendance [Query 1_evidence 1] and [Query 1_evidence 2].

3. **Security Considerations**: The White House pointed out that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president could have disrupted the funeral services. This logistical concern was part of the rationale behind the decision to send Vice President Joe Biden instead, who was available to attend without the same level of disruption [Query 1_evidence 2].

The overall conclusion from the evidence suggests that while the decision not to attend Scalia's funeral was politically charged and criticized by some, it was framed by the White House as a respectful choice guided by considerations of the nature of the event and logistical concerns.

**Confidence Level**: 90%
This high confidence level is due to the strong nature of the corroborating statements from credible sources and the clarity of the reasons provided by the White House in the extracted evidence.

This was considered an appropriate way for the president to honor Justice Scalia, according to White House spokesperson Josh Earnest, who stated, \"the president will pay his respects at the Supreme Court on Friday\". 2. **Respect for the Funeral's Intimacy**: Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, noted that the funeral was described as a service for \"friends and family members,\" and argued that since President Obama does not fit into either of those categories, his absence was respectful rather than dismissive. She emphasized that Justice Scalia was a private person who likely would not have wanted the spectacle that would accompany a presidential attendance. 3. **Security Considerations**: The White House pointed out that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president could have disrupted the funeral services. This logistical concern was part of the rationale behind the decision to send Vice President Joe Biden instead, who was available to attend without the same level of disruption. The overall conclusion from the evidence suggests that while the decision not to attend Scalia's funeral was politically charged and criticized by some, it was framed by the White House as a respectful choice guided by considerations of the nature of the event and logistical concerns.", "Confidence": "90%"}},

  "Claim": "President Obama snubbed the funeral of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in order to play golf.",
  "Video_information": {'video_date': 20160217.0, 'platform': 'nbcnews', 'video_headline': "Obama speaks out on battle to fill Scalia's seat", 'video_transcript': "And now to the heated debate over replacing supreme court justice Antonin Scalia, president Obama now waging into the Republican opposition against him naming Scalia successor. NBC's Andrea Mitchell has the latest on that. Andrea, good morning. Good morning, Savannah. President Obama is forcefully rejecting Republican calls to let the next president nominate justice Scalia's replacement, even as a handful of Republican senators are now breaking with their leaders and saying the Obama nominee should at least get a fair hearing. The constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now. In California Tuesday, president Obama arguing he will nominate someone for the high court despite calls by Republican leaders that the pick be left to his successor. Historically, this has not been viewed as a question. There's no unwritten law that says that it can only be done on off ears. That's not in the constitutional text. And even some Republicans criticized what appeared to be a rush to the political barricade so soon after justice Scalia's death. This was a misstep. I think it was a political misstep. First off, that is not the first thing you say within hours of the passing of someone like, justice Scalia. The president vowed to pick someone indisputably qualified. But with battle lines drawn, will that nominee even get a hearing? The Republican senator in charge of any confirmation hearing, Chuck Grassley, appeared to open the door telling Iowa radio I would wait until, the nominee, is made before I would make any decision. But later senator Grassley seemed to backtrack, telling NBC News he is not open to a confirmation. At the Supreme Court this week, remembrances for justice Scalia, his seat draped with black cloth in his honor. And on Friday, the justice will return one last time, lying in repose at the court's great hall with a funeral set for Saturday at the basilica of the National Shrine in Washington. Meanwhile, with conspiracy theories taking off over Scalia's sudden death, law enforcement officials and the owner of the Texas ranch where he died are completely ruling out foul play.

Additionally, the White House explained that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president might have disrupted the funeral, which further informed their decision.

This was considered an appropriate way for the president to honor Justice Scalia, according to White House spokesperson Josh Earnest, who stated, "the president will pay his respects at the Supreme Court on Friday". 2. **Respect for the Funeral\'s Intimacy**: Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, noted that the funeral was described as a service for "friends and family members," and argued that since President Obama does not fit into either of those categories, his absence was respectful rather than dismissive. She emphasized that Justice Scalia was a private person who likely would not have wanted the spectacle that would accompany a presidential attendance. 3. **Security Considerations**: The White House pointed out that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president could have disrupted the funeral services. This logistical concern was part of the rationale behind the decision to send Vice President Joe Biden instead, who was available to attend without the same level of disruption. The overall conclusion from the evidence suggests that while the decision not to attend Scalia\'s funeral was politically charged and criticized by some, it was framed by the White House as a respectful choice guided by considerations of the nature of the event and logistical concerns.', 'Confidence': '90%'}},

  "CVResult": {
    "Judgment": "No",
    "Confidence": "85%",
    "Reason": "The existing information provides a strong argument against the claim that President Obama snubbed Justice Scalia's funeral to play golf. The White House had stated that Obama chose to pay his respects at the Supreme Court instead of attending the funeral because it was intended for 'friends and family members' and he did not fit that description. Additionally, logistical considerations mentioned include the potential disruption caused by his security detail. These points indicate that the decision was made with respect for privacy and logistical reasons rather than a prioritization of golf. However, while these reasons are compelling, they do not entirely eliminate the possibility of political motivations or other interpretations. Thus, while the evidence leans towards the claim being false, it is not definitive enough to fully adjudicate the truthfulness of the claim with complete certainty."

1. Online search is generally recommended for most questions to provide comprehensive and up-to-date information.
2. If the question can be fully and confidently answered using only the given 'Claim', 'Video_information', and 'QA_CONTEXTS', online search may not be necessary.
3. If the question specifically asks about details or content exclusively present in the video, online search may not be needed.
4. For any question that could benefit from additional context, background, or current information, online search is recommended.

Based on these criteria, determine if online search is needed (Yes or No). If online search could potentially provide any useful information or context, even if not strictly necessary, choose 'Yes'. Only choose 'No' if the question is entirely about specific video content that cannot be found online.

If the result is 'Yes', generate two new queries for Google Custom Search API. If 'No', do not provide any queries.

If generating queries:
- Ensure Query 1 and Query 2 focus on different aspects of the question and are not repetitive.
- Each query should be concise (not exceeding 10 words) and suitable for Google Custom Search API.
- Provide key terms that represent the core focus of each specific query. Key terms must be a single word.

"Claim": "President Obama snubbed the funeral of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in order to play golf.",
"Video_information": {'video_date': 20160217.0, 'platform': 'nbcnews', 'video_headline': "Obama speaks out on battle to fill Scalia's seat", 'video_transcript': "And now to the heated debate over replacing supreme court justice Antonin Scalia, president Obama now waging into the Republican opposition against him naming Scalia successor. NBC's Andrea Mitchell has the latest on that. Andrea, good morning. Good morning, Savannah. President Obama is forcefully rejecting Republican calls to let the next president nominate justice Scalia's replacement, even as a handful of Republican senators are now breaking with their leaders and saying the Obama nominee should at least get a fair hearing. The constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now. In California Tuesday, president Obama arguing he will nominate someone for the high court despite calls by Republican leaders that the pick be left to his successor. Historically, this has not been viewed as a question. There's no unwritten law that says that it can only be done on off ears. That's not in the constitutional text. And even some Republicans criticized what appeared to be a rush to the political barricade so soon after justice Scalia's death. This was a misstep. I think it was a political misstep. First off, that is not the first thing you say within hours of the passing of someone like, justice Scalia. The president vowed to pick someone indisputably qualified. But with battle lines drawn, will that nominee even get a hearing? The Republican senator in charge of any confirmation hearing, Chuck Grassley, appeared to open the door telling Iowa radio I would wait until, the nominee, is made before I would make any decision. But later senator Grassley seemed to backtrack, telling NBC News he is not open to a confirmation. At the Supreme Court this week, remembrances for justice Scalia, his seat draped with black cloth in his honor. And on Friday, the justice will return one last time, lying in repose at the court's great hall with a funeral set for Saturday at the basilica of the National Shrine in Washington. Meanwhile, with conspiracy theories taking off over Scalia's sudden death, law enforcement officials and the owner of the Texas ranch where he died are completely ruling out foul play. Saying a pillow found in his bed was above his head, not over his face, as some reports initially stated. The Scalia vacancy is already a big issue for the 2016 candidates, of course, with each side seeing an historic opportunity to determine the outcome of major issues like abortion and immigration, depending on who is gonna gain the majority in those closely decided 5 to 4 decisions. Savannah and Willie.", 'Video_descriptor': "The video features a sequence of news-related segments, starting with an older man, potentially a political figure, speaking in a formal setting with a red background and the phrase 'I WOULD WAIT UNTIL THE NOMINEE IS MADE BEFORE I WOULD MAKE ANY DECISIONS,' alongside a 'TODAY' logo. Following this, a composite image reveals a memorial outside a government or institutional building with a lowered American flag. Subsequently, a man in a suit is seen addressing an audience at the 'U.S.-ASEAN LEADERS SUMMIT' about a significant political decision related to a Supreme Court nomination, as indicated by the 'NBC NEWS' overlay. A female news anchor then appears in a studio setting labeled 'NBC NEWS WASHINGTON' discussing 'DECISION 2016'. Another scene captures the American flag at half-mast with mountains in the background, accompanied by 'PRESIDENT'S SUPREME DECISION' news banner and an NBC News timestamp. A close-up shot follows, showing a public figure smiling with a blurred indoor background linked to the President's Supreme Decision news story.

"QA_CONTEXTS": {'Initial_Question_Generation': {'Question': "Did President Obama prioritize golf over attending Justice Scalia's funeral based on video evidence?", 'Answer': 'Based on the evidence, President Obama did not prioritize golf over attending Justice Scalia\'s funeral. Instead, he decided to skip the funeral due to the perception of it being a private event intended for family and close friends, while instead paying his respects by visiting the Supreme Court where Justice Scalia lay in repose. The evidence indicates that this decision was not politically motivated, but rather a matter of respect for Justice Scalia’s privacy. Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, commented that the announcement for the mass indicated it was for "friends and family members," and that Obama does not fit into either category, suggesting that his absence from the funeral was respectful, not dismissive. Additionally, the White House explained that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president might have disrupted the funeral, which further informed their decision. In conclusion, there is no substantial video evidence or context suggesting Obama was prioritizing golf over attending the funeral; the decision appears to stem from a complex interplay of respect for the deceased and logistical considerations surrounding a presidential appearance.', 'Confidence': '85%'}, 'Follow_Up_Question_1': {'Question': "What were the official reasons given by the White House for President Obama's absence from Justice Scalia's funeral?", 'Answer': 'The official reasons given by the White House for President Obama\'s absence from Justice Scalia\'s funeral include the following: 1. **Paying Respects at the Supreme Court**: The White House confirmed that President Obama would pay his respects on the day prior to the funeral, when Scalia’s body was lying in repose at the Great Hall of the Supreme Court. This was considered an appropriate way for the president to honor Justice Scalia, according to White House spokesperson Josh Earnest, who stated, "the president will pay his respects at the Supreme Court on Friday". 2. **Respect for the Funeral\'s Intimacy**: Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, noted that the funeral was described as a service for "friends and family members," and argued that since President Obama does not fit into either of those categories, his absence was respectful rather than dismissive. She emphasized that Justice Scalia was a private person who likely would not have wanted the spectacle that would accompany a presidential attendance. 3. **Security Considerations**: The White House pointed out that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president could have disrupted the funeral services. This logistical concern was part of the rationale behind the decision to send Vice President Joe Biden instead, who was available to attend without the same level of disruption. The overall conclusion from the evidence suggests that while the decision not to attend Scalia\'s funeral was politically charged and criticized by some, it was framed by the White House as a respectful choice guided by considerations of the nature of the event and logistical concerns.', 'Confidence': '90%'}},

1. **www.cnn.com**
   - **Score: 8/10**
   - **Explanation:** CNN is one of the most prominent news organizations globally and has a large team of journalists dedicated to fact-checking and news reporting. While it has faced criticism and accusations of bias, its commitment to covering various aspects of news and analysis provides a significant degree of reliability. It has established guidelines for accuracy and maintaining journalistic integrity, although it has occasionally engaged in sensationalism, which slightly detracts from its rating.

2. **rollcall.com**
   - **Score: 7/10**
   - **Explanation:** Roll Call is a publication that focuses on American politics and policy. It is considered credible, particularly within the realms of political reporting and analysis. As it is specialized in U.S. legislative affairs, it offers in-depth reporting that tends to be fact-checked and reliable. However, its niche focus may limit broader coverage of issues, and it has faced challenges regarding perceived bias within political reporting.

3. **nypost.com**
   - **Score: 6/10**
   - **Explanation:** The New York Post is a well-known tabloid publication that often sensationalizes stories, and while it provides news coverage, its reputation is mixed due to its editorial choices and tendency for clickbait-style reporting. The reliability of its reporting can vary, often prioritizing sensationalism which can raise questions about the accuracy of its content. It's important to cross-verify Post reports with more reputable sources for confirmation.

4. **time.com**
   - **Score: 8/10**
   - **Explanation:** Time Magazine is a historic publication with a strong reputation for in-depth reporting and investigation. It generally maintains high standards for journalistic integrity and fact-checking. Though there may occasionally be concerns about bias, particularly in editorial choices, Time is widely respected for its thorough analysis and coverage of significant national and international events.

5. **www.voanews.com**
   - **Score: 8/10**
   - **Explanation:** Voice of America (VOA) is a U.S. government-funded international news service that aims to present unbiased news.

6. **www.obamalibrary.gov**
   - **Score: 9/10**
   - **Explanation:** The official website of the Obama Presidential Library presents factual and historical information about President Obama's presidency and initiatives.

The library sources its content responsibly, making it an authoritative reference for understanding Obama's presidency without political bias.

7. **twitter.com**
   - **Score: 5/10**
   - **Explanation:** Twitter is a social media platform that can spread both accurate news and misinformation rapidly. While there are credible voices and institutions present on Twitter, the platform itself is not a news source and lacks editorial oversight. Users must critically assess the credibility of the information they encounter, which lowers its overall reliability score.

8. **www.theguardian.com**
   - **Score: 8/10**
   - **Explanation:** The Guardian is known for its investigative journalism and comprehensive coverage of both domestic and international issues. It has a solid reputation for accuracy and thoughtful analysis, although it can be perceived as having a liberal bias. Nevertheless, it is a credible source for news reporting and often engages in fact-checking and transparency regarding sources.

   - **Score: 8/10**
   - **Explanation:** NBC News is a major news outlet that provides a wide range of news coverage and is generally respected for its investigative journalism and adherence to fact-checking practices. While it has faced scrutiny for perceived bias, it remains a reputable source of information and analysis regarding significant national and global events.

10. **www.washingtonpost.com**
    - **Score: 9/10**
    - **Explanation:** The Washington Post is renowned for its journalism and investigative reporting, especially in political contexts.

It was only in recent years that he started doing some media appearances,\u201d Perry said Friday by phone on her way to Washington for the funeral service. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have wanted the huge spectacle that it would have been if the president attended,\u201d \u00a0\\n She also recalled her attendance at Justice William Brennan\u2019s funeral, saying security was tight due to Clinton\u2019s attendance: \u201cI can remember going through the metal detectors \u2014 my pepper spray was confiscated.\u201d \u00a0\\n Ed Whalen, a former Scalia law clerk who now is president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, declined an interview Friday but told told The\u00a0New York Times \u00a0he believes Obama made the right decision. \u00a0\\n White House officials were quick to note that since news broke of Scalia\u2019s death Saturday evening, the president has twice praised his service to the country and legal intellect. \u00a0\\n \u201cObviously, Justice Scalia and I had different political orientations and probably would have disagreed on the outcome of certain cases,\u201d Obama said Tuesday. \u201cBut there is no doubt that he was a giant on the Supreme Court, helped to shape the legal landscape. \u00a0\\n \u201cHe was, by all accounts, a good friend and loved his family deeply,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so, you know, it\u2019s important, before we rush into all the politics of this, to take stock of somebody who made enormous contributions to the United States, and we are grateful not only for his service, but for his family\u2019s service.\u201d \u00a0\\n But it was fewer than 24 hours before those very politics confronted Obama. \u00a0\\n On Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest announced that the first couple would skip the funeral.

He dispatched Vice President Joe Biden instead to honor Scalia, who served on the court for 30 years  in Texas.\\n\u201cItalian-Americans take paying respects at funerals very seriously,\u201d said Philip Foglia, vice president of the Italian-American Museum. \u201cJustice Scalia was a milestone for the community.

John McCain is remembered at memorial ceremonies in Arizona and Washington, D.C., this week, and when he lies in state at the U.S. Capitol on Friday, it will be a time for many of those who knew him to pay their respects. But President Trump will not attend the funeral \u2014 at the request of the Arizona Republican himself.\\nThough the specific request marks a departure from the norms of memorializing notable political figures, the question of Trump\u2019s attendance is part of a long history of meaning when it comes to presidential funeral attendance. It\u2019s relatively common for other members of an administration to attend funerals in the president\u2019s stead, but it\u2019s also common for those decisions to be assigned great meaning.\\nMcCain, who died at the age of 81 a little more than a year after being diagnosed with an aggressive brain cancer, had a longtime feud with Trump, which extended to pointed remarks in his farewell letter. McCain\u2019s family had asked that Trump not attend funeral services prior to the Arizona senator\u2019s death, according to initial reports from the New York Times later confirmed by the Associated Press. In his requests for the funeral, McCain asked that former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush deliver eulogies.\\nTrump, who earned rebukes on Monday after flying flags at the White House at full staff, a decision he then reversed, is not the first president to be absent at the funeral of a person with great impact on American history.\\nFormer president Lyndon Johnson did not attend the funeral for Martin Luther King Jr., citing security concerns, according to Rebecca Burns\u2019 book Burial for a King: Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s Funeral and the Week that Transformed Atlanta and Rocked the Nation. Vice-President Hubert Humphrey was sent instead. Johnson spent the day of King\u2019s funeral meeting with top advisors at Camp David to talk about the Vietnam War, while the civil rights leader was buried in Atlanta \u2014 but it was a decision that apparently left the president agonized, as he weighed his personal safety against the message he wanted to send and the meaning of his presence.\\nMore recently, President Obama drew criticism when he declined to attend the funeral of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. While the decision was not totally out of the ordinary \u2014 previous presidents have skipped funerals for other Supreme Court justices \u2014 rumors flew about why Obama would not attend Scalia\u2019s funeral.

The court also could order the case to be re-argued after the Senate confirms Scalia's replacement.\\nWith the showdown between Obama and Senate Republicans raising the possibility of a long wait before Scalia's successor is confirmed, the court will remain shorthanded for an uncertain period of time.\\nThe court could split 4-4 on several important cases during its current term, which runs through the end of June. They include its first abortion case since 2007, a presidential powers dispute involving Obama's unilateral actions on immigration policy, and a conservative challenge to organized labor's clout.\\n**Utah case**\\nThe court on Monday will hear an appeal filed by Utah officials of a ruling by the state's top court in favor of Edward Strieff, who was convicted on drug charges.\\nThe state Supreme Court ruled that evidence presented by prosecutors against Strieff was inadmissible because it violated his right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures under the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment.\\nScalia was in the majority in two 5-4 rulings in recent years backing police in similar cases.\\n\\\"Scalia's vote might have been critical,\\\" George Washington University Law School professor Orin Kerr said of the Strieff case.\\nStrieff was convicted of methamphetamine possession and a related drug charge after his vehicle was stopped by police.\\nHis lawyers contend Strieff's Fourth Amendment rights were violated because although there was a warrant issued for his arrest at the time of the search, the police officer did not know that when he stopped Strieff's vehicle.\\nBefore hearing Strieff's case, the justices will consider a dispute between a federal contractor and the U.S. government.\\nThe first lawyer due to step up the lectern on Monday will be Thomas Saunders of the Wilmer...[Content truncated]\"\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"evidence5\": {\n            \"title\": \"Timeline | Barack Obama Presidential Library\",\n            \"link\": \"https://www.obamalibrary.gov/timeline\",\n            \"displayLink\": \"www.obamalibrary.gov\",\n            \"snippet\": \"Former First Lady Nancy Reagan attends the bill signing. ...

2024-08-01 22:00:14 - ThreadPoolExecutor-2_0 - INFO - Here are the relevance evaluations for each piece of evidence in relation to the question regarding public and media reactions to Obama's absence from Scalia's funeral versus his golf outing:

1. **evidence0**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 7
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses the criticisms Obama faced for not attending Scalia's funeral, including social media reactions from Trump. While it indicates negative reactions, it does not directly compare his absence to any golfing activity, which would be needed for a stronger assessment of the claim.

2. **evidence1**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 8
   - **Justification**: This source discusses the context of Obama's absence and includes opinions from those who felt his decision was disrespectful. It helps understand the public sentiment around the absence, but still does not offer concrete reactions regarding the golf outing versus this absence.

3. **evidence2**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 9
   - **Justification**: This evidence provides strong criticism of Obama's absence as a slight, specifying the impact on the Italian-American community and general public perception. It touches on the perception of the absence as politically charged, aligning well with public reaction. While it does not mention golf directly, it emphasizes the context surrounding the absence.

4. **evidence3**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 6
   - **Justification**: Although this evidence touches on previous presidents attending funerals, it does not significantly address reactions to Obama's absence versus any golfing activity. Its relevance is limited and contextual rather than directly addressing public response.

5. **evidence4**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 5
   - **Justification**: This article focuses on the impact of Scalia's absence on the Supreme Court and the political discussions that arose. It does not specifically address public or media reactions to Obama's absence or his golfing, thus being less relevant.

6. **evidence5**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 2
   - **Justification**: This resource provides a timeline of events but does not correlate to public or media reactions regarding Obama’s absence from the funeral compared to any golf outings.

7. **evidence6**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 1
   - **Justification**: This source is not relevant to the question. It pertains to President Biden's current administration and activities, with no reference to Scalia's funeral or Obama’s absence.

8. **evidence7**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 4
   - **Justification**: This piece mentions the overall atmosphere at the funeral and a quote from Trump about Obama's absence. However, it fails to provide a substantial discussion on public reactions to a golf outing as a comparison.

9. **evidence8**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 7
   - **Justification**: The announcement of Obama's decision not to attend Scalia's funeral includes explanations from the White House. It lacks the public reaction dynamics and specifics on golf, leading to less relevance.

10. **evidence9**
    - **RelevanceScore**: 8
    - **Justification**: This evidence discusses both attendance and public reaction, highlighting criticisms of Obama. It provides a more thorough context involving public opinion while not mentioning golf directly.

These evaluations help in ascertaining how relevant each piece of evidence is to understanding the public and media reactions to Obama’s absence from Scalia's funeral versus golf, particularly in relation to assessing the veracity of the claim presented.

"Claim": "President Obama snubbed the funeral of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in order to play golf.",
"Video_information": {'video_date': 20160217.0, 'platform': 'nbcnews', 'video_headline': "Obama speaks out on battle to fill Scalia's seat", 'video_transcript': "And now to the heated debate over replacing supreme court justice Antonin Scalia, president Obama now waging into the Republican opposition against him naming Scalia successor. NBC's Andrea Mitchell has the latest on that. Andrea, good morning. Good morning, Savannah. President Obama is forcefully rejecting Republican calls to let the next president nominate justice Scalia's replacement, even as a handful of Republican senators are now breaking with their leaders and saying the Obama nominee should at least get a fair hearing. The constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now. In California Tuesday, president Obama arguing he will nominate someone for the high court despite calls by Republican leaders that the pick be left to his successor. Historically, this has not been viewed as a question. There's no unwritten law that says that it can only be done on off ears. That's not in the constitutional text. And even some Republicans criticized what appeared to be a rush to the political barricade so soon after justice Scalia's death. This was a misstep. I think it was a political misstep. First off, that is not the first thing you say within hours of the passing of someone like, justice Scalia. The president vowed to pick someone indisputably qualified. But with battle lines drawn, will that nominee even get a hearing? The Republican senator in charge of any confirmation hearing, Chuck Grassley, appeared to open the door telling Iowa radio I would wait until, the nominee, is made before I would make any decision. But later senator Grassley seemed to backtrack, telling NBC News he is not open to a confirmation. At the Supreme Court this week, remembrances for justice Scalia, his seat draped with black cloth in his honor. And on Friday, the justice will return one last time, lying in repose at the court's great hall with a funeral set for Saturday at the basilica of the National Shrine in Washington. Meanwhile, with conspiracy theories taking off over Scalia's sudden death, law enforcement officials and the owner of the Texas ranch where he died are completely ruling out foul play. Saying a pillow found in his bed was above his head, not over his face, as some reports initially stated. The Scalia vacancy is already a big issue for the 2016 candidates, of course, with each side seeing an historic opportunity to determine the outcome of major issues like abortion and immigration, depending on who is gonna gain the majority in those closely decided 5 to 4 decisions. Savannah and Willie.", 'Video_descriptor': "The video features a sequence of news-related segments, starting with an older man, potentially a political figure, speaking in a formal setting with a red background and the phrase 'I WOULD WAIT UNTIL THE NOMINEE IS MADE BEFORE I WOULD MAKE ANY DECISIONS,' alongside a 'TODAY' logo. Following this, a composite image reveals a memorial outside a government or institutional building with a lowered American flag. Subsequently, a man in a suit is seen addressing an audience at the 'U.S.-ASEAN LEADERS SUMMIT' about a significant political decision related to a Supreme Court nomination, as indicated by the 'NBC NEWS' overlay. A female news anchor then appears in a studio setting labeled 'NBC NEWS WASHINGTON' discussing 'DECISION 2016'. Another scene captures the American flag at half-mast with mountains in the background, accompanied by 'PRESIDENT'S SUPREME DECISION' news banner and an NBC News timestamp. A close-up shot follows, showing a public figure smiling with a blurred indoor background linked to the President's Supreme Decision news story. Lastly, a cathedral-like structure with a news banner highlighting 'PRESIDENT'S SUPREME DECISION' and 'Obama Pledges to Move Ahead with SCOTUS Nomination' is displayed without any visible individuals."},
"QA_CONTEXTS": {'Initial_Question_Generation': {'Question': "Did President Obama prioritize golf over attending Justice Scalia's funeral based on video evidence?", 'Answer': 'Based on the evidence, President Obama did not prioritize golf over attending Justice Scalia\'s funeral. Instead, he decided to skip the funeral due to the perception of it being a private event intended for family and close friends, while instead paying his respects by visiting the Supreme Court where Justice Scalia lay in repose. The evidence indicates that this decision was not politically motivated, but rather a matter of respect for Justice Scalia’s privacy. Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, commented that the announcement for the mass indicated it was for "friends and family members," and that Obama does not fit into either category, suggesting that his absence from the funeral was respectful, not dismissive. Additionally, the White House explained that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president might have disrupted the funeral, which further informed their decision. In conclusion, there is no substantial video evidence or context suggesting Obama was prioritizing golf over attending the funeral; the decision appears to stem from a complex interplay of respect for the deceased and logistical considerations surrounding a presidential appearance.', 'Confidence': '85%'}, 'Follow_Up_Question_1': {'Question': "What were the official reasons given by the White House for President Obama's absence from Justice Scalia's funeral?", 'Answer': 'The official reasons given by the White House for President Obama\'s absence from Justice Scalia\'s funeral include the following: 1. **Paying Respects at the Supreme Court**: The White House confirmed that President Obama would pay his respects on the day prior to the funeral, when Scalia’s body was lying in repose at the Great Hall of the Supreme Court. This was considered an appropriate way for the president to honor Justice Scalia, according to White House spokesperson Josh Earnest, who stated, "the president will pay his respects at the Supreme Court on Friday". 2. **Respect for the Funeral\'s Intimacy**: Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, noted that the funeral was described as a service for "friends and family members," and argued that since President Obama does not fit into either of those categories, his absence was respectful rather than dismissive. She emphasized that Justice Scalia was a private person who likely would not have wanted the spectacle that would accompany a presidential attendance. 3. **Security Considerations**: The White House pointed out that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president could have disrupted the funeral services. This logistical concern was part of the rationale behind the decision to send Vice President Joe Biden instead, who was available to attend without the same level of disruption. The overall conclusion from the evidence suggests that while the decision not to attend Scalia\'s funeral was politically charged and criticized by some, it was framed by the White House as a respectful choice guided by considerations of the nature of the event and logistical concerns.', 'Confidence': '90%'}},

2024-08-01 22:00:33 - ThreadPoolExecutor-2_1 - INFO - Here’s an evaluation of the specified websites based on their credibility in terms of truthfulness, historical accuracy, and ability to detect fake news. Each website is given a score from 0 to 10, along with explanations for the rating.

### 1. www.facebook.com
**Quality Score: 4/10**
- **Explanation**: Facebook is a social media platform rather than a news organization. While it allows users to share information, it has been criticized for the spread of misinformation and lack of accountability for content posted by users. It has made efforts to address misinformation through fact-checking partnerships, but the platform is still often associated with the proliferation of false news, leading to a lower credibility score.

### 2. dodsoco.ogc.osd.mil
**Quality Score: 6/10**
- **Explanation**: This domain appears to belong to a U.S. government organization related to the Department of Defense. Government websites generally have a level of reliability and credibility due to their formal nature and oversight; however, this specific domain may not be widely recognized as a primary news source or fact-checking outlet. It can provide accurate information related to its specific field, but lacks broader context for news evaluation.

### 3. www.deseret.com
**Quality Score: 7/10**
- **Explanation**: Deseret News is a well-established media outlet, affiliated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Known for its local news coverage and commentary, it generally maintains standards to ensure factual reporting. However, it can be perceived as having a particular ideological viewpoint. As such, it is relatively credible, especially in its coverage of regional issues, but may lack objectivity in certain national or global matters.

### 4. smdp.com
**Quality Score: 5/10**
- **Explanation**: Santa Monica Daily Press (SMDP) is a local newspaper focusing on Santa Monica news. While it serves its community effectively and covers local events and issues, its reach and authority in covering broader national or international news are limited. The quality of reporting may also vary, hence a middle-ground score reflecting its local focus but limited national significance.

### 5. www.politico.com
**Quality Score: 9/10**
- **Explanation**: Politico is recognized as a reliable source for political news and analysis. It has a strong editorial reputation, boasts experienced journalists, and employs fact-checking practices. While it has been criticized for biases in some reports, overall, it is respected for its breadth of coverage and depth on political issues, making it one of the more credible sites for political information.

### 6. theintercept.com
**Quality Score: 8/10**
- **Explanation**: The Intercept is a progressive news organization known for investigative journalism and a commitment to uncovering issues related to privacy, surveillance, and civil liberties. While it has a specific ideological stance, it has a track record for thorough fact-checking and investigative reporting. Still, due to its bias in certain topics, it receives a slightly lower score than purely neutral outlets.

### 7. www.theguardian.com
**Quality Score: 8/10**
- **Explanation**: The Guardian is a reputable UK-based newspaper known for its comprehensive coverage and investigative journalism. While it is often outlined as having a liberal bias, its commitment to factual reporting, transparency, and the correction of errors lends it a solid credibility score. It is a reliable source, particularly for international news.

### 8. www.bostonmagazine.com
**Quality Score: 6/10**
- **Explanation**: Boston Magazine primarily features lifestyle, culture, and local news coverage. While it offers high-quality articles and reports on local issues effectively, it lacks the same rigorous investigative journalism standards as larger news organizations. Consequently, while it can be factual within its context, it doesn't hold the same level of accountability for national news reporting.

### 9. www.nytimes.com
**Quality Score: 9/10**
- **Explanation**: The New York Times is one of the most respected newspapers in the world, known for its rigorous fact-checking and comprehensive coverage across many topics. It has a high standard for journalistic integrity and extensive resources for covering diverse issues. While it may have some editorial bias, it maintains trustworthiness in its reporting efforts.

### 10. www.theguardian.com (duplicate entry)
**Quality Score: 8/10**
- **Explanation**: (See above explanation)

In summary, these scores reflect a combination of historical accuracy, reliability, and ability to detect and expose misinformation, ensuring that users have a clear idea of which sources they can trust more for accurate news reporting.

It doesn\u2019t hold regular press briefings, as the State Department has under most administrations. The one advantage that reporters covering the CIA have is time.

Two weeks later, Hurricane Laura blew it down. Now the jury has to decide not whether to take it down, but whether to put it back up again.\\nAnd then, of course, in Britain there was the statue of Edward Colston, a Bristol slave trader, which ended up in the drink. Britain\u2019s major cities, including Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and Leeds, are undertaking reviews of their statues.\\nMany spurious arguments have been made about these actions, and I will come to them in a minute. But the debate around public art and memorialisation, as it pertains to statues, should be engaged not ducked. One response I have heard is that we should even out the score by erecting statues of prominent black, abolitionist, female and other figures that are underrepresented. I understand the motivation. To give a fuller account of the range of experiences, voices, hues and ideologies that have made us what we are. To make sure that public art is rooted in the lives of the whole public, not just a part of it, and that we all might see ourselves in the figures that are represented.\\nBut while I can understand it, I do not agree with it. The problem isn\u2019t that we have too few statues, but too many. I think it is a good thing that so many of these statues of pillagers, plunderers, bigots and thieves have been taken down. I think they are offensive. But I don\u2019t think they should be taken down because they are offensive. I think they should be taken down because I think all statues should be taken down.\\nHere, to be clear, I am talking about statues of people, not other works of public memorials such as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington DC, the Holocaust memorial in Berlin or the Famine memorial in Dublin. I think works like these serve the important function of public memorialisation, and many have the added benefit of being beautiful.\\nThe same cannot be said of statues of people. I think they are poor as works of public art and poor as efforts at memorialisation. Put more succinctly, they are lazy and ugly. So yes, take down the slave traders, imperial conquerors, colonial murderers, warmongers and genocidal exploiters. But while you\u2019re at it, take down the freedom fighters, trade unionists, human rights champions and revolutionaries. Yes, remove Columbus, Leopold II, Colston and Rhodes.

But it was only fitting that in her death Rosalynn Carter, the pioneering woman who turned the role of first lady , did one final thing no one else has been able to do this year: lure Melania Trump out of Mar-a-Lago and back into the public eye. Not only that, but she created a situation in which Mrs. Trump was seated right next to Michelle Obama.\\nMrs. Trump has eschewed almost every major event since leaving the White House in January 2021, including her husband\u2019s several court appearances (the rare exception being his  that he was once again running for president). But on Tuesday, as is custom, she joined the three other living former first ladies \u2014 Mrs. Obama, Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush \u2014 as well as Jill Biden, the current first lady, at the Glenn Memorial United Methodist Church in Atlanta, for Mrs. Carter\u2019s memorial service.\\n\u201cRosalynn Carter would be so pleased she brought all of you together on this day,\u201d the journalist Judy Woodruff said.\\nImage\\nFrom left, former President Bill Clinton, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Obama at the service.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York Times\\nIt was the first time since , in 2018, that all of the living first ladies had been in one place.

   - **RelevanceScore**: 3
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses former presidents and first ladies, but it does not provide specific reactions to Obama's absence from Scalia's funeral versus his golfing activity. While it mentions past gatherings of former presidents, it does not specifically relate to the current question.

4. **evidence3**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 5
   - **Justification**: This evidence compares Trump’s criticisms of Obama's golfing to Trump's own golf outings. It hints at the public's critical view of a president's golfing habits in general but does not directly address Obama's absence from Scalia's funeral or specific public reactions to it.

5. **evidence4**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 3
   - **Justification**: This evidence pertains to general political commentary and the dynamics between current and former politicians. It does not specifically address reactions to Obama’s absence from Scalia's funeral or public opinion related to golfing, which limits its relevance.

8. **evidence7**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 2
   - **Justification**: This entry about personal golf experiences does not connect to the political context or public opinions regarding Obama's funeral absence or golf outings. Its relevance is very minimal.

9. **evidence8**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 4
   - **Justification**: While this evidence discusses a recent gathering of former first ladies and their public appearances, it does not delve into the specific context of Obama's absence from Scalia's funeral versus his golfing habits, making it somewhat relevant but not directly addressing the question.

10. **evidence9**: 
    - **RelevanceScore**: 1
    - **Justification**: This evidence focuses on George W. Bush's eulogy and unrelated funeral contexts, offering no insights or reactions about Obama's golf outing or absence from Scalia's funeral, hence it holds low relevance.

"Claim": "President Obama snubbed the funeral of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in order to play golf.",
"Video_information": {
  "video_date": 20160217.0,
  "platform": "nbcnews",
  "video_headline": "Obama speaks out on battle to fill Scalia's seat",
  "video_transcript": "And now to the heated debate over replacing supreme court justice Antonin Scalia, president Obama now waging into the Republican opposition against him naming Scalia successor. NBC's Andrea Mitchell has the latest on that. Andrea, good morning. Good morning, Savannah. President Obama is forcefully rejecting Republican calls to let the next president nominate justice Scalia's replacement, even as a handful of Republican senators are now breaking with their leaders and saying the Obama nominee should at least get a fair hearing. The constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now. In California Tuesday, president Obama arguing he will nominate someone for the high court despite calls by Republican leaders that the pick be left to his successor. Historically, this has not been viewed as a question. There's no unwritten law that says that it can only be done on off ears. That's not in the constitutional text. And even some Republicans criticized what appeared to be a rush to the political barricade so soon after justice Scalia's death. This was a misstep. I think it was a political misstep. First off, that is not the first thing you say within hours of the passing of someone like, justice Scalia. The president vowed to pick someone indisputably qualified. But with battle lines drawn, will that nominee even get a hearing? The Republican senator in charge of any confirmation hearing, Chuck Grassley, appeared to open the door telling Iowa radio I would wait until, the nominee, is made before I would make any decision. But later senator Grassley seemed to backtrack, telling NBC News he is not open to a confirmation. At the Supreme Court this week, remembrances for justice Scalia, his seat draped with black cloth in his honor. And on Friday, the justice will return one last time, lying in repose at the court's great hall with a funeral set for Saturday at the basilica of the National Shrine in Washington. Meanwhile, with conspiracy theories taking off over Scalia's sudden death, law enforcement officials and the owner of the Texas ranch where he died are completely ruling out foul play. Saying a pillow found in his bed was above his head, not over his face, as some reports initially stated. The Scalia vacancy is already a big issue for the 2016 candidates, of course, with each side seeing an historic opportunity to determine the outcome of major issues like abortion and immigration, depending on who is gonna gain the majority in those closely decided 5 to 4 decisions. Savannah and Willie.",
  "Video_descriptor": "The video features a sequence of news-related segments, starting with an older man, potentially a political figure, speaking in a formal setting with a red background and the phrase 'I WOULD WAIT UNTIL THE NOMINEE IS MADE BEFORE I WOULD MAKE ANY DECISIONS,' alongside a 'TODAY' logo. Following this, a composite image reveals a memorial outside a government or institutional building with a lowered American flag. Subsequently, a man in a suit is seen addressing an audience at the 'U.S.-ASEAN LEADERS SUMMIT' about a significant political decision related to a Supreme Court nomination, as indicated by the 'NBC NEWS' overlay. A female news anchor then appears in a studio setting labeled 'NBC NEWS WASHINGTON' discussing 'DECISION 2016'. Another scene captures the American flag at half-mast with mountains in the background, accompanied by 'PRESIDENT'S SUPREME DECISION' news banner and an NBC News timestamp. A close-up shot follows, showing a public figure smiling with a blurred indoor background linked to the President's Supreme Decision news story. Lastly, a cathedral-like structure with a news banner highlighting 'PRESIDENT'S SUPREME DECISION' and 'Obama Pledges to Move Ahead with SCOTUS Nomination' is displayed without any visible individuals."

  "Initial_Question_Generation": {
    "Question": "Did President Obama prioritize golf over attending Justice Scalia's funeral based on video evidence?",
    "Answer": "Based on the evidence, President Obama did not prioritize golf over attending Justice Scalia's funeral. Instead, he decided to skip the funeral due to the perception of it being a private event intended for family and close friends, while instead paying his respects by visiting the Supreme Court where Justice Scalia lay in repose. The evidence indicates that this decision was not politically motivated, but rather a matter of respect for Justice Scalia\u2019s privacy. Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, commented that the announcement for the mass indicated it was for \"friends and family members,\" and that Obama does not fit into either category, suggesting that his absence from the funeral was respectful, not dismissive. Additionally, the White House explained that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president might have disrupted the funeral, which further informed their decision. In conclusion, there is no substantial video evidence or context suggesting Obama was prioritizing golf over attending the funeral; the decision appears to stem from a complex interplay of respect for the deceased and logistical considerations surrounding a presidential appearance.",

  "Follow_Up_Question_1": {
    "Question": "What were the official reasons given by the White House for President Obama's absence from Justice Scalia's funeral?",
    "Answer": "The official reasons given by the White House for President Obama's absence from Justice Scalia's funeral include the following: 1. **Paying Respects at the Supreme Court**: The White House confirmed that President Obama would pay his respects on the day prior to the funeral, when Scalia\u2019s body was lying in repose at the Great Hall of the Supreme Court. This was considered an appropriate way for the president to honor Justice Scalia, according to White House spokesperson Josh Earnest, who stated, \"the president will pay his respects at the Supreme Court on Friday\". 2. **Respect for the Funeral's Intimacy**: Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, noted that the funeral was described as a service for \"friends and family members,\" and argued that since President Obama does not fit into either of those categories, his absence was respectful rather than dismissive. She emphasized that Justice Scalia was a private person who likely would not have wanted the spectacle that would accompany a presidential attendance. 3. **Security Considerations**: The White House pointed out that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president could have disrupted the funeral services. This logistical concern was part of the rationale behind the decision to send Vice President Joe Biden instead, who was available to attend without the same level of disruption. The overall conclusion from the evidence suggests that while the decision not to attend Scalia's funeral was politically charged and criticized by some, it was framed by the White House as a respectful choice guided by considerations of the nature of the event and logistical concerns.",

    "content": "The farewell to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia took place in the resplendent Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, the largest Catholic church in the United States. Hundreds of friends and admirers, many from the top echelons of Washington\u2019s legal and political worlds, gathered for a send-off that was supposed to be, as Washington Archbishop Donald Cardinal Wuerl joked, in his opening remarks, \u201ca simple parish family Mass.\u201d A knowing laugh rippled through the pews.\nFunerals in Washington are rarely simple when it comes to such larger-than-life figures as Scalia. For many in the crowd, it was a day to mourn a man they knew and loved. For others, showing up was an affirmation of conservative bona fides and membership in this city\u2019s power elite.\nWuerl name-checked a few VIPs in attendance: Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.; Vice ; former vice president Richard B. Cheney; former House speaker Newt Gingrich (whose wife, Callista, sang in the choir); and Catholic University President John Garvey.\nOthers created a frisson when they arrived, included Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch; Sen. Ted Cruz (a former Supreme Court clerk who stepped away from the campaign trail to attend the service); and Ted Olson, the renowned Washington lawyer who argued the 2000 _Bush v. Gore_ case before the Supreme Court and, in 2013, the test of California's same-sex marriage ban. There was also a section of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit \u2014 including three rumored to be in the running for Scalia's seat: Merrick Garland, Sri Srinivasan and Patricia Millett.\nBut it was an absence that created a firestorm. Conservatives loudly criticized President Obama for snubbing the longest-sitting justice when the White House announced he would not attend. Rejecting the notion that the decision was political, press secretary Josh Earnest defended sending Biden as \u201csomebody that had his own personal relationship with Justice Scalia and his family.\u201d What\u2019s more, he said, Biden\u2019s security footprint would be less disruptive. \u201cWe believe we have settled on an appropriate and respectful arrangement,\u201d he said.\n...[Content truncated]"

    "video_transcript": "And now to the heated debate over replacing supreme court justice Antonin Scalia, president Obama now waging into the Republican opposition against him naming Scalia successor. NBC's Andrea Mitchell has the latest on that. Andrea, good morning. Good morning, Savannah. President Obama is forcefully rejecting Republican calls to let the next president nominate justice Scalia's replacement, even as a handful of Republican senators are now breaking with their leaders and saying the Obama nominee should at least get a fair hearing. The constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now. In California Tuesday, president Obama arguing he will nominate someone for the high court despite calls by Republican leaders that the pick be left to his successor. Historically, this has not been viewed as a question. There's no unwritten law that says that it can only be done on off ears. That's not in the constitutional text. And even some Republicans criticized what appeared to be a rush to the political barricade so soon after justice Scalia's death. This was a misstep. I think it was a political misstep. First off, that is not the first thing you say within hours of the passing of someone like, justice Scalia. The president vowed to pick someone indisputably qualified. But with battle lines drawn, will that nominee even get a hearing? The Republican senator in charge of any confirmation hearing, Chuck Grassley, appeared to open the door telling Iowa radio I would wait until, the nominee, is made before I would make any decision. But later senator Grassley seemed to backtrack, telling NBC News he is not open to a confirmation. At the Supreme Court this week, remembrances for justice Scalia, his seat draped with black cloth in his honor. And on Friday, the justice will return one last time, lying in repose at the court's great hall with a funeral set for Saturday at the basilica of the National Shrine in Washington. Meanwhile, with conspiracy theories taking off over Scalia's sudden death, law enforcement officials and the owner of the Texas ranch where he died are completely ruling out foul play. Saying a pillow found in his bed was above his head, not over his face, as some reports initially stated. The Scalia vacancy is already a big issue for the 2016 candidates, of course, with each side seeing an historic opportunity to determine the outcome of major issues like abortion and immigration, depending on who is gonna gain the majority in those closely decided 5 to 4 decisions. Savannah and Willie.",

        "Question": "Did President Obama prioritize golf over attending Justice Scalia's funeral based on video evidence?",
        "Answer": "Based on the evidence, President Obama did not prioritize golf over attending Justice Scalia's funeral. Instead, he decided to skip the funeral due to the perception of it being a private event intended for family and close friends, while instead paying his respects by visiting the Supreme Court where Justice Scalia lay in repose. The evidence indicates that this decision was not politically motivated, but rather a matter of respect for Justice Scalia’s privacy. Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, commented that the announcement for the mass indicated it was for \"friends and family members,\" and that Obama does not fit into either category, suggesting that his absence from the funeral was respectful, not dismissive. Additionally, the White House explained that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president might have disrupted the funeral, which further informed their decision. In conclusion, there is no substantial video evidence or context suggesting Obama was prioritizing golf over attending the funeral; the decision appears to stem from a complex interplay of respect for the deceased and logistical considerations surrounding a presidential appearance.",

        "Question": "What were the official reasons given by the White House for President Obama's absence from Justice Scalia's funeral?",
        "Answer": "The official reasons given by the White House for President Obama's absence from Justice Scalia's funeral include the following: 1. **Paying Respects at the Supreme Court**: The White House confirmed that President Obama would pay his respects on the day prior to the funeral, when Scalia’s body was lying in repose at the Great Hall of the Supreme Court. This was considered an appropriate way for the president to honor Justice Scalia, according to White House spokesperson Josh Earnest, who stated, \"the president will pay his respects at the Supreme Court on Friday\". 2. **Respect for the Funeral's Intimacy**: Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, noted that the funeral was described as a service for \"friends and family members,\" and argued that since President Obama does not fit into either of those categories, his absence was respectful rather than dismissive. She emphasized that Justice Scalia was a private person who likely would not have wanted the spectacle that would accompany a presidential attendance. 3. **Security Considerations**: The White House pointed out that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president could have disrupted the funeral services. This logistical concern was part of the rationale behind the decision to send Vice President Joe Biden instead, who was available to attend without the same level of disruption. The overall conclusion from the evidence suggests that while the decision not to attend Scalia's funeral was politically charged and criticized by some, it was framed by the White House as a respectful choice guided by considerations of the nature of the event and logistical concerns.",

But rather than also attending Scalia’s funeral on Saturday morning, Obama is dispatching Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.  \n   Barbara Perry, presidential studies director at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center, believes Scalia would not have wanted any president to attend.  \n “The announcement on the Supreme Court’s website said the mass is for ‘friends and family members ,’” said Perry, who got to know Scalia as a high court fellow. “And President Obama does not fit into either of those categories.  \n Perry does not believe Obama is missing an opportunity to extend an olive branch to Republicans and help ease the bitter partisanship that has plagued his tenure. “I don’t think it’s a political statement,” she said. “I think the decision was one made of out respect.  \n “And Justice Scalia was a private person.

2024-08-01 22:01:35 - Thread-1 (process_claim_verification) - INFO - The public and media reactions to President Obama's absence from Justice Scalia's funeral varied significantly, particularly in contrast to how they perceived his golf outing during that time.

1. **Criticism of Absence from Funeral**: Various media outlets, particularly conservative ones, were quite vocal in their criticism of Obama's absence at Scalia's funeral. Reports indicated that many viewed his decision as a slight not only to Scalia's family but also to the Italian-American community, given Scalia's background as the first Italian-American Supreme Court Justice. Neil Mattera, president of the Columbus Alliance, expressed that the absence was disappointing, with others commenting that it converted a moment of mourning into a partisan issue. Some noted that it was "historic" and should have been recognized by the President, highlighting the missed opportunity to bridge partisan divides during a somber occasion [Query 1_evidence 2····][Query 1_evidence 3····].

2. **Defense of Decision**: Supporters of Obama framed the decision not to attend as one of respect for Justice Scalia's wishes for a private service meant for "friends and family." Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, reinforced this perspective by stating that Scalia likely would not have wanted the 'spectacle' that would have accompanied the president's attendance. The White House also indicated that logistical concerns, such as the security footprint of a sitting president, played a role in the decision, with Vice President Joe Biden attending instead [Query 1_evidence 1····][Query 1_evidence 3····].

3. **Comparison to Golf Outing**: While Obama’s decision to skip the funeral was scrutinized and characterized as a snub, his golf outing came under different light. The media generally questioned whether the timing of his golf round during the weekend of Scalia’s funeral overshadowed the serious nature of the event. However, the focus remained largely on the absence from the funeral, which created a larger narrative around his presidency's perceived disrespect towards conservative figures compared to the implications of golfing [Query 1_evidence 2····].

In conclusion, the media and public reactions largely centered around criticisms of Obama for his absence from Scalia's funeral, framing it as disrespectful, while the decision to play golf did not receive as much critical visibility. The handling of his absence suggested a disconnect with political protocols surrounding significant national events, illustrating a mixed reception where his golfing was overshadowed by the political ramifications of missing the funeral.

Reports indicated that many viewed his decision as a slight not only to Scalia's family but also to the Italian-American community, given Scalia's background as the first Italian-American Supreme Court Justice. Neil Mattera, president of the Columbus Alliance, expressed that the absence was disappointing, with others commenting that it converted a moment of mourning into a partisan issue. Some noted that it was \"historic\" and should have been recognized by the President, highlighting the missed opportunity to bridge partisan divides during a somber occasion.\n\n2. **Defense of Decision**: Supporters of Obama framed the decision not to attend as one of respect for Justice Scalia's wishes for a private service meant for \"friends and family.\" Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, reinforced this perspective by stating that Scalia likely would not have wanted the 'spectacle' that would have accompanied the president's attendance. The White House also indicated that logistical concerns, such as the security footprint of a sitting president, played a role in the decision, with Vice President Joe Biden attending instead.\n\n3. **Comparison to Golf Outing**: While Obama\u2019s decision to skip the funeral was scrutinized and characterized as a snub, his golf outing came under different light. The media generally questioned whether the timing of his golf round during the weekend of Scalia\u2019s funeral overshadowed the serious nature of the event. However, the focus remained largely on the absence from the funeral, which created a larger narrative around his presidency's perceived disrespect towards conservative figures compared to the implications of golfing.\n\nIn conclusion, the media and public reactions largely centered around criticisms of Obama for his absence from Scalia's funeral, framing it as disrespectful, while the decision to play golf did not receive as much critical visibility. The handling of his absence suggested a disconnect with political protocols surrounding significant national events, illustrating a mixed reception where his golfing was overshadowed by the political ramifications of missing the funeral.", "Confidence": "85%"}},

  "Claim": "President Obama snubbed the funeral of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in order to play golf.",
  "Video_information": {'video_date': 20160217.0, 'platform': 'nbcnews', 'video_headline': "Obama speaks out on battle to fill Scalia's seat", 'video_transcript': "And now to the heated debate over replacing supreme court justice Antonin Scalia, president Obama now waging into the Republican opposition against him naming Scalia successor. NBC's Andrea Mitchell has the latest on that. Andrea, good morning. Good morning, Savannah. President Obama is forcefully rejecting Republican calls to let the next president nominate justice Scalia's replacement, even as a handful of Republican senators are now breaking with their leaders and saying the Obama nominee should at least get a fair hearing. The constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now. In California Tuesday, president Obama arguing he will nominate someone for the high court despite calls by Republican leaders that the pick be left to his successor. Historically, this has not been viewed as a question. There's no unwritten law that says that it can only be done on off ears. That's not in the constitutional text. And even some Republicans criticized what appeared to be a rush to the political barricade so soon after justice Scalia's death. This was a misstep. I think it was a political misstep. First off, that is not the first thing you say within hours of the passing of someone like, justice Scalia. The president vowed to pick someone indisputably qualified. But with battle lines drawn, will that nominee even get a hearing? The Republican senator in charge of any confirmation hearing, Chuck Grassley, appeared to open the door telling Iowa radio I would wait until, the nominee, is made before I would make any decision. But later senator Grassley seemed to backtrack, telling NBC News he is not open to a confirmation. At the Supreme Court this week, remembrances for justice Scalia, his seat draped with black cloth in his honor. And on Friday, the justice will return one last time, lying in repose at the court's great hall with a funeral set for Saturday at the basilica of the National Shrine in Washington. Meanwhile, with conspiracy theories taking off over Scalia's sudden death, law enforcement officials and the owner of the Texas ranch where he died are completely ruling out foul play. Saying a pillow found in his bed was above his head, not over his face, as some reports initially stated. The Scalia vacancy is already a big issue for the 2016 candidates, of course, with each side seeing an historic opportunity to determine the outcome of major issues like abortion and immigration, depending on who is gonna gain the majority in those closely decided 5 to 4 decisions. Savannah and Willie.", 'Video_descriptor': "The video features a sequence of news-related segments, starting with an older man, potentially a political figure, speaking in a formal setting with a red background and the phrase 'I WOULD WAIT UNTIL THE NOMINEE IS MADE BEFORE I WOULD MAKE ANY DECISIONS,' alongside a 'TODAY' logo. Following this, a composite image reveals a memorial outside a government or institutional building with a lowered American flag. Subsequently, a man in a suit is seen addressing an audience at the 'U.S.-ASEAN LEADERS SUMMIT' about a significant political decision related to a Supreme Court nomination, as indicated by the 'NBC NEWS' overlay. A female news anchor then appears in a studio setting labeled 'NBC NEWS WASHINGTON' discussing 'DECISION 2016'. Another scene captures the American flag at half-mast with mountains in the background, accompanied by 'PRESIDENT'S SUPREME DECISION' news banner and an NBC News timestamp.

  "QA_CONTEXTS": {'Initial_Question_Generation': {'Question': "Did President Obama prioritize golf over attending Justice Scalia's funeral based on video evidence?", 'Answer': 'Based on the evidence, President Obama did not prioritize golf over attending Justice Scalia\'s funeral. Instead, he decided to skip the funeral due to the perception of it being a private event intended for family and close friends, while instead paying his respects by visiting the Supreme Court where Justice Scalia lay in repose. The evidence indicates that this decision was not politically motivated, but rather a matter of respect for Justice Scalia’s privacy. Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, commented that the announcement for the mass indicated it was for "friends and family members," and that Obama does not fit into either category, suggesting that his absence from the funeral was respectful, not dismissive. Additionally, the White House explained that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president might have disrupted the funeral, which further informed their decision. In conclusion, there is no substantial video evidence or context suggesting Obama was prioritizing golf over attending the funeral; the decision appears to stem from a complex interplay of respect for the deceased and logistical considerations surrounding a presidential appearance.', 'Confidence': '85%'}, 'Follow_Up_Question_1': {'Question': "What were the official reasons given by the White House for President Obama's absence from Justice Scalia's funeral?", 'Answer': 'The official reasons given by the White House for President Obama\'s absence from Justice Scalia\'s funeral include the following: 1. **Paying Respects at the Supreme Court**: The White House confirmed that President Obama would pay his respects on the day prior to the funeral, when Scalia’s body was lying in repose at the Great Hall of the Supreme Court. This was considered an appropriate way for the president to honor Justice Scalia, according to White House spokesperson Josh Earnest, who stated, "the president will pay his respects at the Supreme Court on Friday". 2. **Respect for the Funeral\'s Intimacy**: Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, noted that the funeral was described as a service for "friends and family members," and argued that since President Obama does not fit into either of those categories, his absence was respectful rather than dismissive. She emphasized that Justice Scalia was a private person who likely would not have wanted the spectacle that would accompany a presidential attendance. 3. **Security Considerations**: The White House pointed out that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president could have disrupted the funeral services. This logistical concern was part of the rationale behind the decision to send Vice President Joe Biden instead, who was available to attend without the same level of disruption. The overall conclusion from the evidence suggests that while the decision not to attend Scalia\'s funeral was politically charged and criticized by some, it was framed by the White House as a respectful choice guided by considerations of the nature of the event and logistical concerns.', 'Confidence': '90%'}, 'Follow_Up_Question_2': {'Question': "What were the public and media reactions to Obama's absence from Scalia's funeral versus his golf outing?", 'Answer': 'The public and media reactions to President Obama\'s absence from Justice Scalia\'s funeral varied significantly, particularly in contrast to how they perceived his golf outing during that time.\n\n1. **Criticism of Absence from Funeral**: Various media outlets, particularly conservative ones, were quite vocal in their criticism of Obama\'s absence at Scalia\'s funeral. Reports indicated that many viewed his decision as a slight not only to Scalia\'s family but also to the Italian-American community, given Scalia\'s background as the first Italian-American Supreme Court Justice. Neil Mattera, president of the Columbus Alliance, expressed that the absence was disappointing, with others commenting that it converted a moment of mourning into a partisan issue. Some noted that it was "historic" and should have been recognized by the President, highlighting the missed opportunity to bridge partisan divides during a somber occasion.\n\n2. **Defense of Decision**: Supporters of Obama framed the decision not to attend as one of respect for Justice Scalia\'s wishes for a private service meant for "friends and family." Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, reinforced this perspective by stating that Scalia likely would not have wanted the \'spectacle\' that would have accompanied the president\'s attendance. The White House also indicated that logistical concerns, such as the security footprint of a sitting president, played a role in the decision, with Vice President Joe Biden attending instead.\n\n3. **Comparison to Golf Outing**: While Obama’s decision to skip the funeral was scrutinized and characterized as a snub, his golf outing came under different light. The media generally questioned whether the timing of his golf round during the weekend of Scalia’s funeral overshadowed the serious nature of the event. However, the focus remained largely on the absence from the funeral, which created a larger narrative around his presidency\'s perceived disrespect towards conservative figures compared to the implications of golfing.\n\nIn conclusion, the media and public reactions largely centered around criticisms of Obama for his absence from Scalia\'s funeral, framing it as disrespectful, while the decision to play golf did not receive as much critical visibility. The handling of his absence suggested a disconnect with political protocols surrounding significant national events, illustrating a mixed reception where his golfing was overshadowed by the political ramifications of missing the funeral.', 'Confidence': '85%'}},

    "Judgment": "No",
    "Confidence": "85%",
    "Reason": "The existing information is insufficient to definitively judge the truthfulness of the claim that President Obama snubbed Justice Scalia's funeral to play golf. While the context provided indicates that Obama's absence was due to a combination of respect for the funeral's intended intimacy, paying respects at the Supreme Court, and logistical security concerns, it does not directly address the timing of Obama's golf outing relative to these events. Although the White House framed Obama's decision as respectful, the criticism surrounding his absence implies there may have been partisan perceptions at play. The information highlights the criticism of his absence but does not confirm the claim that he prioritized golf over attending the funeral. The nuances surrounding the political context and the lack of specific dates for the golf outing prevent a concrete determination, leading to an 85% confidence level that the existing information does not fully resolve the truthfulness of the claim."
