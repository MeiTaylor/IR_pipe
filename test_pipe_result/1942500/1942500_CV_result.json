        "video_transcript": "And now to the heated debate over replacing supreme court justice Antonin Scalia, president Obama now waging into the Republican opposition against him naming Scalia successor. NBC's Andrea Mitchell has the latest on that. Andrea, good morning. Good morning, Savannah. President Obama is forcefully rejecting Republican calls to let the next president nominate justice Scalia's replacement, even as a handful of Republican senators are now breaking with their leaders and saying the Obama nominee should at least get a fair hearing. The constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now. In California Tuesday, president Obama arguing he will nominate someone for the high court despite calls by Republican leaders that the pick be left to his successor. Historically, this has not been viewed as a question. There's no unwritten law that says that it can only be done on off ears. That's not in the constitutional text. And even some Republicans criticized what appeared to be a rush to the political barricade so soon after justice Scalia's death. This was a misstep. I think it was a political misstep. First off, that is not the first thing you say within hours of the passing of someone like, justice Scalia. The president vowed to pick someone indisputably qualified. But with battle lines drawn, will that nominee even get a hearing? The Republican senator in charge of any confirmation hearing, Chuck Grassley, appeared to open the door telling Iowa radio I would wait until, the nominee, is made before I would make any decision. But later senator Grassley seemed to backtrack, telling NBC News he is not open to a confirmation. At the Supreme Court this week, remembrances for justice Scalia, his seat draped with black cloth in his honor. And on Friday, the justice will return one last time, lying in repose at the court's great hall with a funeral set for Saturday at the basilica of the National Shrine in Washington. Meanwhile, with conspiracy theories taking off over Scalia's sudden death, law enforcement officials and the owner of the Texas ranch where he died are completely ruling out foul play. Saying a pillow found in his bed was above his head, not over his face, as some reports initially stated. The Scalia vacancy is already a big issue for the 2016 candidates, of course, with each side seeing an historic opportunity to determine the outcome of major issues like abortion and immigration, depending on who is gonna gain the majority in those closely decided 5 to 4 decisions. Savannah and Willie.",
        "Video_descriptor": "The video features a sequence of news-related segments, starting with an older man, potentially a political figure, speaking in a formal setting with a red background and the phrase 'I WOULD WAIT UNTIL THE NOMINEE IS MADE BEFORE I WOULD MAKE ANY DECISIONS,' alongside a 'TODAY' logo. Following this, a composite image reveals a memorial outside a government or institutional building with a lowered American flag. Subsequently, a man in a suit is seen addressing an audience at the 'U.S.-ASEAN LEADERS SUMMIT' about a significant political decision related to a Supreme Court nomination, as indicated by the 'NBC NEWS' overlay. A female news anchor then appears in a studio setting labeled 'NBC NEWS WASHINGTON' discussing 'DECISION 2016'. Another scene captures the American flag at half-mast with mountains in the background, accompanied by 'PRESIDENT'S SUPREME DECISION' news banner and an NBC News timestamp. A close-up shot follows, showing a public figure smiling with a blurred indoor background linked to the President's Supreme Decision news story. Lastly, a cathedral-like structure with a news banner highlighting 'PRESIDENT'S SUPREME DECISION' and 'Obama Pledges to Move Ahead with SCOTUS Nomination' is displayed without any visible individuals."

    "Initial_Question_Generation": {
        "Question": "Did President Obama prioritize golf over attending Justice Scalia's funeral based on video evidence?",
        "Answer": "Based on the evidence, President Obama did not prioritize golf over attending Justice Scalia's funeral. Instead, he decided to skip the funeral due to the perception of it being a private event intended for family and close friends, while instead paying his respects by visiting the Supreme Court where Justice Scalia lay in repose. The evidence indicates that this decision was not politically motivated, but rather a matter of respect for Justice Scalia’s privacy. Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, commented that the announcement for the mass indicated it was for \"friends and family members,\" and that Obama does not fit into either category, suggesting that his absence from the funeral was respectful, not dismissive. Additionally, the White House explained that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president might have disrupted the funeral, which further informed their decision. In conclusion, there is no substantial video evidence or context suggesting Obama was prioritizing golf over attending the funeral; the decision appears to stem from a complex interplay of respect for the deceased and logistical considerations surrounding a presidential appearance.",

    "Follow_Up_Question_1": {
        "Question": "What were the official reasons given by the White House for President Obama's absence from Justice Scalia's funeral?",
        "Answer": "The official reasons given by the White House for President Obama's absence from Justice Scalia's funeral include the following: 1. **Paying Respects at the Supreme Court**: The White House confirmed that President Obama would pay his respects on the day prior to the funeral, when Scalia’s body was lying in repose at the Great Hall of the Supreme Court. This was considered an appropriate way for the president to honor Justice Scalia, according to White House spokesperson Josh Earnest, who stated, \"the president will pay his respects at the Supreme Court on Friday\". 2. **Respect for the Funeral's Intimacy**: Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, noted that the funeral was described as a service for \"friends and family members,\" and argued that since President Obama does not fit into either of those categories, his absence was respectful rather than dismissive. She emphasized that Justice Scalia was a private person who likely would not have wanted the spectacle that would accompany a presidential attendance. 3. **Security Considerations**: The White House pointed out that the extensive security detail required for a sitting president could have disrupted the funeral services. This logistical concern was part of the rationale behind the decision to send Vice President Joe Biden instead, who was available to attend without the same level of disruption. The overall conclusion from the evidence suggests that while the decision not to attend Scalia's funeral was politically charged and criticized by some, it was framed by the White House as a respectful choice guided by considerations of the nature of the event and logistical concerns.",

    "Follow_Up_Question_2": {
        "Question": "What were the public and media reactions to Obama's absence from Scalia's funeral versus his golf outing?",
        "Answer": "The public and media reactions to President Obama's absence from Justice Scalia's funeral varied significantly, particularly in contrast to how they perceived his golf outing during that time.\n\n1. **Criticism of Absence from Funeral**: Various media outlets, particularly conservative ones, were quite vocal in their criticism of Obama's absence at Scalia's funeral. Reports indicated that many viewed his decision as a slight not only to Scalia's family but also to the Italian-American community, given Scalia's background as the first Italian-American Supreme Court Justice. Neil Mattera, president of the Columbus Alliance, expressed that the absence was disappointing, with others commenting that it converted a moment of mourning into a partisan issue. Some noted that it was \"historic\" and should have been recognized by the President, highlighting the missed opportunity to bridge partisan divides during a somber occasion.\n\n2. **Defense of Decision**: Supporters of Obama framed the decision not to attend as one of respect for Justice Scalia's wishes for a private service meant for \"friends and family.\" Barbara Perry, a presidential studies director, reinforced this perspective by stating that Scalia likely would not have wanted the 'spectacle' that would have accompanied the president's attendance. The White House also indicated that logistical concerns, such as the security footprint of a sitting president, played a role in the decision, with Vice President Joe Biden attending instead.\n\n3. **Comparison to Golf Outing**: While Obama’s decision to skip the funeral was scrutinized and characterized as a snub, his golf outing came under different light. The media generally questioned whether the timing of his golf round during the weekend of Scalia’s funeral overshadowed the serious nature of the event. However, the focus remained largely on the absence from the funeral, which created a larger narrative around his presidency's perceived disrespect towards conservative figures compared to the implications of golfing.\n\nIn conclusion, the media and public reactions largely centered around criticisms of Obama for his absence from Scalia's funeral, framing it as disrespectful, while the decision to play golf did not receive as much critical visibility. The handling of his absence suggested a disconnect with political protocols surrounding significant national events, illustrating a mixed reception where his golfing was overshadowed by the political ramifications of missing the funeral.",

    "CVResult": {
        "Judgment": "No",
        "Confidence": "85%",
        "Reason": "The existing information is insufficient to definitively judge the truthfulness of the claim that President Obama snubbed Justice Scalia's funeral to play golf. While the context provided indicates that Obama's absence was due to a combination of respect for the funeral's intended intimacy, paying respects at the Supreme Court, and logistical security concerns, it does not directly address the timing of Obama's golf outing relative to these events. Although the White House framed Obama's decision as respectful, the criticism surrounding his absence implies there may have been partisan perceptions at play. The information highlights the criticism of his absence but does not confirm the claim that he prioritized golf over attending the funeral. The nuances surrounding the political context and the lack of specific dates for the golf outing prevent a concrete determination, leading to an 85% confidence level that the existing information does not fully resolve the truthfulness of the claim."

    "Final_Judgement": {
        "Answer": "False",
        "Reasons": "The claim that President Obama snubbed Justice Scalia's funeral to play golf is false. The White House explained that Obama chose to pay his respects at the Supreme Court when Scalia lay in repose, which was deemed more appropriate given that the funeral was meant for friends and family, and thus his absence was a matter of respect rather than neglect. Obama attended a private ceremony rather than the funeral itself due to privacy concerns and logistics involving presidential security [Initial_Question_Generation_Query 1_evidence1, Follow_Up_Question_1_Query 1_evidence1]. Furthermore, there is no substantial evidence indicating he prioritized golf over attending the funeral; the decision to play golf was not criticized as heavily compared to the absence from the funeral [Follow_Up_Question_2_Query 1_evidence2].",
        "Therefore, the Claim authenticity is": "False",
