She was facing a  of as much as three years in prison.\nWhen it comes to the food industry, it's not always easy being cheesy. That's the takeaway from  detailing the use of cellulose (aka wood pulp) in shredded cheese products in the U.S. The use of fillers like cellulose is hotly contested, but perhaps not for the reason you might think.\nAn FDA investigation found that a Pennsylvania company, Castle Cheese Inc., had doctored its so-called \"Parmesan\" with a mix of cheap cheddar cheese and cellulose (also known as wood pulp). The President of the company is currently facing a hefty fine and prison time for  the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\nIt's really a kind of consumer fraud.\nWhile much of the media's focus has been on the wood pulp, cellulose is in fact a very common food additive. The legality has more to do with the fact that the cheese is improperly labeled: The FDA's  regarding Parmesan requires that each ingredient be listed on the label (with the exception of animal, plant or microbial enzymes, which can simply be declared \"enzymes\").\nNora Weiser, executive director of the American Cheese Society, says cellulose isn't found in wheels of cheese, but in shredded varieties, where it's used as an anti-caking agent. \"It is a legal, food-grade additive,\" she says. \"It keeps the grated cheese products from clumping.\"\nAccording to Jaydee Hanson, Policy Director at the Center for Food Safety, the FDA allows cheese products to contain up to four percent cellulose. Any more than that might skirt the law, but Hanson says it's likely not all that harmful. \"You'd have to eat an awful...[Content truncated]",

Just ask Seinfeld's George Costanza!\nBut an FDA investigation raising the question: what's in the cheese you're eating?\nThe agency targeted Castle Cheese, saying what the company labeled as \"100 percent\" Parmesan cheese was actually a blend of cheaper cheeses and \"cellulose\" - an organic filler which can be derived from wood pulp.\nBlasting the company in a letter, the FDA wrote, \"Your Parmesan cheese products do not contain any Parmesan cheese.\"\nThe company took corrective action but ended up filing for bankruptcy and could not be reached for comment.\nThe FDA allows up to four percent filler products like cellulose in cheese. But watchdogs warn that what's in the other 96 percent may not always be what we think.\nExperts say some companies go too far.\n\"A key is, with food fraud, is that the criminals are looking to make money. They're looking to cheat somehow. They're trying to deceive us, they're trying to do things that we don't notice, but to cut corners so that they make money,\" said Dr. John Spink, PHD,  Director and Assistant Professor, Food Fraud Initiative, Michigan State University.\nThe Food Fraud Initiative tracks cases of mislabeling, citing some involving certain brands of cheese, extra virgin olive oil, and seafood.\nTop chefs like MSNBC contributor Tom Collicchio say most people don't have the palate to tell the difference.\n\"We're finding it in olive oil. We're finding it in fish. There was a report the other day that most, something like 40 percent of the lobster that is in lobster dishes isn't lobster, it's other fish.

CBS News decided to investigate.\nYou would think when FDA investigators found Castle Cheese marketing a product as 100 percent Parmesan cheese that is actually zero percent Parmesan, the company has a problem.\n\"The product that they were marketing and which was on the label was not what they were selling,\" said U.S. attorney David Hickton.\nHickton brought the case against Castle Cheese outside of Pittsburgh after an FDA inspection in 2012 found the company's Parmesan was actually a mixture of cheaper cheeses like Swiss and Cheddar, and in one case, an \"unknown ingredient.\"\n\"Advertising it as Parmesan and Romano and putting in something else so the supplier could make more money, that's just clearly fraud on the consumer,\" Hickton said.\nBut CBS News found fraud might not be the worst of it. FDA records show finished cheese was stored in an un-refrigerated room, which could cause bacteria to thrive.\nWhat's more: the company found Listeria, a potentially deadly pathogen, in its production area ten times.  But Castle continued to produce and sell its cheese to stores like Target and Walmart without testing it. \nThat might be troubling enough, but records from the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture -- which inspected Castle around the same time as the FDA -- tell a very different story.  \nIn June 2012, state inspector David Trotter wrote: \"the plant continues to be in excellent condition. I appreciate the plant management and the quality work they do.\"  \nTrotter's glowing reviews from the state continued until August of  2013, when he left the Department of Agriculture for a new job -- as the Director of Quality Control at Castle Cheese.\nCBS News asked Trotter to explain his reviews of Castle, but he declined.\nCastle Cheese is no longer on the market.

            "content": "In the 1950s, the Food and Drug Administration established an official definition for parmesan cheese. , it cannot contain more than 32 precent moisture, while it must have a \"granular texture,\" come with a \"hard and brittle rind,\" grate \"readily,\" and be made from cow's milk, among others things.\nNowhere in the definition is there the suggestion that \"wood pulp\" would be an appropriate ingredient. Nor does it say it's acceptable to substitute in less expensive cheeses, such as cheddar, swiss, and mozzarella. That's not surprising: It should go without saying parmesan cheese should be parmesan cheese.\nAnd yet, somehow, parmesan cheese advertised as 100 percent parmesan appears to be including wood pulp and other cheese, unbeknownst to us.\nThe unusual tactic was first flagged by the FDA in 2012, when it found evidence that Castle Cheese Inc, which sold a variety of shaved parmesan and romano cheeses, was introducing unexpected substances into its parmesan cheese products. The government agency wrote the company , which was filled with unambiguous language like \"your product labels declare that the products are parmesan cheese or romano cheese, but they are in fact a mixture of trimmings of various cheeses and other ingredients\" and \"your parmesan cheese products do not contain any parmesan cheese.\"\nWhat distinguishes one cheese from another is a consequence of both its ingredients and the process in which its made.

            "content": "> **UPDATE, January 23:** Last week,  Universal Cheese & Drying and International Packing, the company behind the Castle Cheese brand, with a $500,000 fine for their roles in the mislabeling. , former Cheese Castle executive Michelle Myrter received a sentence of three years probation and a $5,000 fine after pleading guilty to food adulteration. She was facing a  of as much as three years in prison.\nWhen it comes to the food industry, it's not always easy being cheesy. That's the takeaway from  detailing the use of cellulose (aka wood pulp) in shredded cheese products in the U.S. The use of fillers like cellulose is hotly contested, but perhaps not for the reason you might think.\nAn FDA investigation found that a Pennsylvania company, Castle Cheese Inc., had doctored its so-called \"Parmesan\" with a mix of cheap cheddar cheese and cellulose (also known as wood pulp). The President of the company is currently facing a hefty fine and prison time for  the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\nIt's really a kind of consumer fraud.\nWhile much of the media's focus has been on the wood pulp, cellulose is in fact a very common food additive. The legality has more to do with the fact that the cheese is improperly labeled: The FDA's  regarding Parmesan requires that each ingredient be listed on the label (with the exception of animal, plant or microbial enzymes, which can simply be declared \"enzymes\").\nNora Weiser, executive director of the American Cheese Society, says cellulose isn't found in wheels of cheese, but in shredded varieties, where it's used as an anti-caking agent. \"It is a legal, food-grade additive,\" she says. \"It keeps the grated cheese products from clumping.\"\nAccording to Jaydee Hanson, Policy Director at the Center for Food Safety, the FDA allows cheese products to contain up to four percent cellulose. Any more than that might skirt the law, but Hanson says it's likely not all that harmful. \"You'd have to eat an awful...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "Does the video provide evidence that Castle Cheese mixes wood pulp with their parmesan cheese?",
        "Answer": "The video does not independently provide evidence that Castle Cheese mixes wood pulp with their parmesan cheese; however, it references claims of such practices. Evidence from several authoritative sources confirms that Castle Cheese was involved in producing parmesan cheese containing wood pulp.\n\nSpecifically, the FDA has found that many cheeses labeled as “100 percent Parmesan” often contain fillers like wood pulp, and Castle Cheese is explicitly mentioned as a company that produced parmesan cheese without actual parmesan for nearly 30 years [Query1_evidence_1]. Furthermore, an FDA investigation highlighted that Castle Cheese labeled its products as parmesan while they included a mixture of various cheeses and ingredients not conforming to the legal definition of parmesan [Query1_evidence_2]. Additional sources corroborate that Castle Cheese has faced legal penalties related to mislabeling and the inclusion of cellulose (wood pulp) in their cheese products [Query1_evidence_3].\n\nTherefore, while the video implies Castle Cheese's involvement with wood pulp in parmesan, the definitive evidence comes from external sources rather than the video itself.",
