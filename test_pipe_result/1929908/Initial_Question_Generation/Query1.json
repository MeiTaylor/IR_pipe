The president of the company, which supplied megastores like Target, is scheduled to plead guilty this month to charges that carry a sentence of up to a year in prison and a $100,o00 fine, according to Bloomberg.\nNeil Schuman—who runs Arthur Shcuman Inc. the largest seller of hard Italian cheese in the U.S.—estimates a whopping 20 percent of such cheese are mislabeled.\nBloomberg ran experiments on store-bought grated cheese to test for wood pulp content in a lab and found that many cheeses have cellulose, which is made from wood pulp. Essential Everyday 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese, from Jewel-Osco, contained 8.8 percent cellulose. Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s Great Value 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese had 7.8 percent cellulose. Whole Foods 365 brand didn’t list cellulose as an ingredient, and tested at 0.3 percent. Kraft had 3.8 percent cellulose.\nRepresentatives at these stores said they were “investigating” these findings.\nWrite to Eliana Dockterman at eliana.dockterman@time.com",

She was facing a  of as much as three years in prison.\nWhen it comes to the food industry, it's not always easy being cheesy. That's the takeaway from  detailing the use of cellulose (aka wood pulp) in shredded cheese products in the U.S. The use of fillers like cellulose is hotly contested, but perhaps not for the reason you might think.\nAn FDA investigation found that a Pennsylvania company, Castle Cheese Inc., had doctored its so-called \"Parmesan\" with a mix of cheap cheddar cheese and cellulose (also known as wood pulp). The President of the company is currently facing a hefty fine and prison time for  the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\nIt's really a kind of consumer fraud.\nWhile much of the media's focus has been on the wood pulp, cellulose is in fact a very common food additive. The legality has more to do with the fact that the cheese is improperly labeled: The FDA's  regarding Parmesan requires that each ingredient be listed on the label (with the exception of animal, plant or microbial enzymes, which can simply be declared \"enzymes\").\nNora Weiser, executive director of the American Cheese Society, says cellulose isn't found in wheels of cheese, but in shredded varieties, where it's used as an anti-caking agent. \"It is a legal, food-grade additive,\" she says. \"It keeps the grated cheese products from clumping.\"\nAccording to Jaydee Hanson, Policy Director at the Center for Food Safety, the FDA allows cheese products to contain up to four percent cellulose. Any more than that might skirt the law, but Hanson says it's likely not all that harmful. \"You'd have to eat an awful...[Content truncated]",

To dupe the public into purchasing a product that they’re led to believe is 100 percent of anything – when it’s not – is not only inaccurate or misleading, it’s a crime. Perhaps the worst crime of all: dishonesty.\nThe substitute that grated Parmesan suppliers have been using in their grated cheese products is called “,” which is an anti-clumping agent derived from wood pulp.\nThe FDA’s investigation into cellulose usage in the cheese industry has struck a nerve and sparked more widespread skepticism across this particular market in the U.S. Not only were a handful of companies adding wood pulp into their products, many were advertising their cheeses as 100 percent grated Romano or grated Parmesan, but, in reality, were adding cheddar, Swiss, Mozzarella, and Havarti into these products – by all accounts cheaper cheeses.\nMichelle Myrter, President of Castle Cheese, Inc., has been facing a 3-year legal battle – and her company, shortly after the FDA’s findings came to public attention in 2013, filed for bankruptcy. It is expected that Myrter will plead guilty to charges of misbranding food. .\nWith Which Grated Cheeses Should Americans Exercise Caution?\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAn  test conducted by _Bloomberg_ found the following cheeses contained cellulose, the wood-pulp based cheese-filler (this list not exhaustive, and many cheeses have not yet been tested):\n*   Walmart’s Great Value 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese® contained 7.8% cellulose\n*   Jewel-Osco’s Essential Everyday 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese® contained 8.8% cellulose\n*   Kraft®’s 100% Real Parmesan Grated Cheese No Fillers contained 3.4% cellulose\n*   Whole Food’s 365 Brand Grated Parmesan® contained less than 1% cellulose\nIt should be disconcerting to many American consumers that the 2 adjectives – “100%” and “real” – often appear in the product labels of these cheeses; almost as if the companies marketing these cheeses are desperately trying to convince buyers that their cheese is the real deal. Labels exist for a reason: to help consumers make more well-informed decisions. When it came to Castle’s fraudulent cheese, it wasn’t merely that their product contained a high amount ofcellulose, it was that their cheese was also a mixture of cheaper cheeses,...[Content truncated]",

So, cellulose is not necessarily wood pulp. Nor is it inherently “unsafe,” as another media outlet, “Women’s Health,” reports in a story with a another alarming headline: “.” The story reports that “according to the Center for Dairy Research (CDR) in Madison, WI, cellulose is an inherently safe additive. But the problem is, it’s gotten out of control. According to the CDR, two to four percent is a generally accepted safe level of the additive, but many brands are far exceeding that measure.” **Is it really out of control? Not if you ask the FDA** Cellulose is a common ingredient, and it’s not “unsafe.”  In fact, the FDA officially classifies it as “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) and  that “consumption of large amounts appear to have no effect other than providing dietary bulk.” This official position — from the federal agency charged with regulating food safety — is a far cry from summaries of reports from lobby groups like the Center for Dairy Research. In short, the evidence is that Parmesan is not going to leave you swallowing splinters. And when we do have unsafe food, it’s up to the FDA — not lobby groups, the media, or the courts — to address those issues. Take Castle Cheese Inc., which faced prosecution by the FDA over its “100% grated Parmesan Cheese.”  The FDA discovered Castle’s Parmesan cheese failed to comply with the regulatory definition and barred further sale. The FDA, under its exclusive authority to enforce its regulations, filed criminal charges. But it wasn’t a class action that led to FDA enforcement, and that’s the right result, because these violations are the responsibility of the FDA and not consumer lawyers trolling the news for a quick payout. As the federal agency charged with protecting the food supply, the FDA has the science, resources, and knowledge to understand the often-complicated interplay between food safety, cost, and public health.  But remember that the FDA responds to facts and science, not fads and tacky headlines. _**Jacob M. Harper** has handled myriad consumer class actions and is an expert in food mislabeling claims — and especially early dismissals — for clients, some of the country’s largest grocers, retailers, and distributors...[Content truncated]",

That's not surprising: It should go without saying parmesan cheese should be parmesan cheese.\nAnd yet, somehow, parmesan cheese advertised as 100 percent parmesan appears to be including wood pulp and other cheese, unbeknownst to us.\nThe unusual tactic was first flagged by the FDA in 2012, when it found evidence that Castle Cheese Inc, which sold a variety of shaved parmesan and romano cheeses, was introducing unexpected substances into its parmesan cheese products. The government agency wrote the company , which was filled with unambiguous language like \"your product labels declare that the products are parmesan cheese or romano cheese, but they are in fact a mixture of trimmings of various cheeses and other ingredients\" and \"your parmesan cheese products do not contain any parmesan cheese.\"\nWhat distinguishes one cheese from another is a consequence of both its ingredients and the process in which its made.

It’s a derivative of wood pulp or plant fibers used to stop clumping and help cheese fall freely through the lid’s holes. They also include , a preservative that stops mold and extends the shelf life of dried fruits, cakes, and wines.\nBoth are , and they’re safe to eat. Nevertheless, the two ingredients, and particularly wood pulp, are at the center of a continuing legal battle that will pick up later this month. It’s about product labeling and what constitutes “pure” Parmesan—the American version of the beloved Parmigiano-Reggiano hard cheese.\n> Cellulose is a fiber derived from plant walls, which means it can be taken from wood and apple pulp or corn cobs.\nOn December 7, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reopened class-action lawsuits that accuse the chees...[Content truncated]",

The FDA investigation found that Castle Cheese, Inc. used wood pulp or cellulose, along with a mix of cheap cheddar, in its 100% Parmesan cheese. As a result, the President of Castle Cheese is facing hefty fines and even prison time because of directly violating the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\nThe History of Wood Filler in Food\nIn the 1970s, companies began adding cellulose to their products as a way to bulk up their products, provide better texture and a creamy 'mouth feel' in reduced fat foods. Companies quickly realized that they could also increase their profits by adding bulk and cellulose fiber to their foods in the form of this wood sawdust.\nToday wood pulp, or cellulose, is actually a very common filler used in a variety of products. It is not against FDA rules and regulations to use this in food products. Cheese companies add cellulose to shredded cheese varieties to keep the grated product from clumping.\nWhat's the Real Problem with Wood Filler \nBut what is the REAL problem with having wood pulp filler in our cheese?
