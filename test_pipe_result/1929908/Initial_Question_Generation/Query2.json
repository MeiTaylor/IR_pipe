CBS News decided to investigate.\nYou would think when FDA investigators found Castle Cheese marketing a product as 100 percent Parmesan cheese that is actually zero percent Parmesan, the company has a problem.\n\"The product that they were marketing and which was on the label was not what they were selling,\" said U.S. attorney David Hickton.\nHickton brought the case against Castle Cheese outside of Pittsburgh after an FDA inspection in 2012 found the company's Parmesan was actually a mixture of cheaper cheeses like Swiss and Cheddar, and in one case, an \"unknown ingredient.\"\n\"Advertising it as Parmesan and Romano and putting in something else so the supplier could make more money, that's just clearly fraud on the consumer,\" Hickton said.\nBut CBS News found fraud might not be the worst of it. FDA records show finished cheese was stored in an un-refrigerated room, which could cause bacteria to thrive.\nWhat's more: the company found Listeria, a potentially deadly pathogen, in its production area ten times.  But Castle continued to produce and sell its cheese to stores like Target and Walmart without testing it. \nThat might be troubling enough, but records from the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture -- which inspected Castle around the same time as the FDA -- tell a very different story.  \nIn June 2012, state inspector David Trotter wrote: \"the plant continues to be in excellent condition. I appreciate the plant management and the quality work they do.\"  \nTrotter's glowing reviews from the state continued until August of  2013, when he left the Department of Agriculture for a new job -- as the Director of Quality Control at Castle Cheese.\nCBS News asked Trotter to explain his reviews of Castle, but he declined.\nCastle Cheese is no longer on the market. The company went bankrupt in 2014.

Hickton announced today.\nUnited States District Judge Mark R. Hornak imposed the sentence on Michelle Myrter, 44, of Harmony, Pennsylvania.\nAccording to information presented to the court, Myrter was a responsible corporate officer of International Packing, LLC and Universal Cheese & Drying, Inc. While she was the responsible corporate officer for both companies, Myrter aided and abetted the companies’ introduction of adulterated and misbranded cheese products into interstate commerce, in violation of provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Universal Cheese & Drying, Inc. and International Packing, LLC each pled guilty to one count of conspiring to introduce misbranded and adulterated cheese products into interstate commerce and to commit money laundering. Sentencing hearings for the two companies will be scheduled by further order of the Court.\nPrior to imposing sentence on Michelle Myrter, Judge Hornak stated that the sentence was sufficient but not greater than necessary to fulfill the purposes of sentencing.\nAssistant United States Attorney Tonya Sulia Goodman prosecuted this case on behalf of the government.\nU.S. Attorney Hickton commended the Food and Drug Administration's Office of Criminal Investigations, and the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation Division for the investigation leading to the successful prosecution of Myrter.\nUpdated October 11, 2016\n* * *\nComponent\nRelated Content\n---------------\nPress Release\nJuly 30, 2024\nPress Release\nJuly 9, 2024\nPress Release\nJune 26, 2024\n*   !\n    700 Grant Street, Suite 4000  \n    Pittsburgh, PA 15219\n    17 South Park Row, Room A330  \n    Erie, PA 16501\n    319 Washington Street, Suite 200  \n    Johnstown, PA 15901\n*   !\n    Pittsburgh: 412-644-3500  \n    Fax: 412-644-4549\n    Erie: 814-452-...[Content truncated]",

But it did contain cellulose, which is made from wood pulp!\n! !\n9911199\\_G\nAuthor: CNN\nPublished: 11:48 AM EST February 18, 2016\nUpdated: 6:46 PM EDT April 14, 2016\n]\nFor many of us,  pasta or pizza wouldn't be the same without it: a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.\nBut when the FDA investigated, it found one company's supposedly 100-percent Parmesan cheese, actually contained substitutes, including a filler that can be derived from wood pulp.\nSo how do you know what you're really buying and eating?\nIt's no secret that Americans love their cheese. Just ask Seinfeld's George Costanza!\nBut an FDA investigation raising the question: what's in the cheese you're eating?\nThe agency targeted Castle Cheese, saying what the company labeled as \"100 percent\" Parmesan cheese was actually a blend of cheaper cheeses and \"cellulose\" - an organic filler which can be derived from wood pulp.\nBlasting the company in a letter, the FDA wrote, \"Your Parmesan cheese products do not contain any Parmesan cheese.\"\nThe company took corrective action but ended up filing for bankruptcy and could not be reached for comment.\nThe FDA allows up to four percent filler products like cellulose in cheese. But watchdogs warn that what's in the other 96 percent may not always be what we think.\nExperts say some companies go too far.\n\"A key is, with food fraud, is that the criminals are looking to make money. They're looking to cheat somehow. They're trying to deceive us, they're trying to do things that we don't notice, but to cut corners so that they make money,\" said Dr. John Spink, PHD,  Director and Assistant Professor, Food Fraud Initiative, Michigan State University.\nThe Food Fraud Initiative tracks cases of mislabeling, citing some involving certain brands of cheese, extra virgin olive oil, and seafood.\nTop chefs like MSNBC contributor Tom Collicchio say most people don't have the palate to tell the difference.\n\"We're finding it in olive oil. We're finding it in fish. There was a report the other day that most, something like 40 percent of the lobster that is in lobster dishes isn't lobster, it's other fish. And so we're seeing it all over. This is I think a big problem. Even in terms...[Content truncated]",

What you need to know\n===================================================\n### Share this:\n*   \n*   \n!\nMICHAEL KUBEL FILE PHOTO / THE MORNING CALL\nAny cheese sold as Parmesan cheese in the United States must meet certain requirements in regard to enzymes, milk fat and moisture content. Only cheese made in the Parma region of Italy can be labeled Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.\n!\nBy  | Staff Report\nUPDATED: March 30, 2019 at 5:18 a.m.\nIn 2012, the Food and Drug Administration investigated Slippery Rock, Pa.,-based Castle Cheese Inc. for selling a product labeled “100 percent grated Parmesan cheese” that was found to be mostly other cheeses and a food filler called cellulose.

Probably not\nWed 17 Feb 2016 12.18 ESTLast modified on Sat 18 Aug 2018 10.00 EDT\nThe grocery store parmesan cheese in the green-topped plastic container you shake over pasta dishes contains non-dairy filler ingredients like wood pulp, according to a  from Bloomberg.\nIn 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration investigated the Pennsylvania cheese factory Castle  Inc and found the company was doctoring its “100% real parmesan” with filler ingredients like wood pulp, or cheaper cheeses like cheddar, swiss and mozzarella.\nFollowing the FDA’s findings, Bloomberg investigated other store-bought grated parmesan and discovered high percentages of cellulose – essentially powdered wood pulp and the main ingredient in paper – in four different brands.\nBloomberg found that “Essential Everyday 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese, from Jewel-Osco, was 8.8% cellulose, while Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s Great Value 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese registered 7.8%, according to test results.

She was facing a  of as much as three years in prison.\nWhen it comes to the food industry, it's not always easy being cheesy. That's the takeaway from  detailing the use of cellulose (aka wood pulp) in shredded cheese products in the U.S. The use of fillers like cellulose is hotly contested, but perhaps not for the reason you might think.\nAn FDA investigation found that a Pennsylvania company, Castle Cheese Inc., had doctored its so-called \"Parmesan\" with a mix of cheap cheddar cheese and cellulose (also known as wood pulp).
