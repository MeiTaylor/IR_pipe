CBS News decided to investigate.\nYou would think when FDA investigators found Castle Cheese marketing a product as 100 percent Parmesan cheese that is actually zero percent Parmesan, the company has a problem.\n\"The product that they were marketing and which was on the label was not what they were selling,\" said U.S. attorney David Hickton.\nHickton brought the case against Castle Cheese outside of Pittsburgh after an FDA inspection in 2012 found the company's Parmesan was actually a mixture of cheaper cheeses like Swiss and Cheddar, and in one case, an \"unknown ingredient.\"\n\"Advertising it as Parmesan and Romano and putting in something else so the supplier could make more money, that's just clearly fraud on the consumer,\" Hickton said.\nBut CBS News found fraud might not be the worst of it. FDA records show finished cheese was stored in an un-refrigerated room, which could cause bacteria to thrive.\nWhat's more: the company found Listeria, a potentially deadly pathogen, in its production area ten times.  But Castle continued to produce and sell its cheese to stores like Target and Walmart without testing it. \nThat might be troubling enough, but records from the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture -- which inspected Castle around the same time as the FDA -- tell a very different story.  \nIn June 2012, state inspector David Trotter wrote: \"the plant continues to be in excellent condition. I appreciate the plant management and the quality work they do.\"  \nTrotter's glowing reviews from the state continued until August of  2013, when he left the Department of Agriculture for a new job -- as the Director of Quality Control at Castle Cheese.\nCBS News asked Trotter to explain his reviews of Castle, but he declined.\nCastle Cheese is no longer on the market. The company went bankrupt in 2014.

Hornak imposed the sentence on Michelle Myrter, 44, of Harmony, Pennsylvania.\nAccording to information presented to the court, Myrter was a responsible corporate officer of International Packing, LLC and Universal Cheese & Drying, Inc. While she was the responsible corporate officer for both companies, Myrter aided and abetted the companies\u2019 introduction of adulterated and misbranded cheese products into interstate commerce, in violation of provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

Just ask Seinfeld's George Costanza!\nBut an FDA investigation raising the question: what's in the cheese you're eating?\nThe agency targeted Castle Cheese, saying what the company labeled as \"100 percent\" Parmesan cheese was actually a blend of cheaper cheeses and \"cellulose\" - an organic filler which can be derived from wood pulp.\nBlasting the company in a letter, the FDA wrote, \"Your Parmesan cheese products do not contain any Parmesan cheese.\"\nThe company took corrective action but ended up filing for bankruptcy and could not be reached for comment.\nThe FDA allows up to four percent filler products like cellulose in cheese. But watchdogs warn that what's in the other 96 percent may not always be what we think.\nExperts say some companies go too far.\n\"A key is, with food fraud, is that the criminals are looking to make money. They're looking to cheat somehow. They're trying to deceive us, they're trying to do things that we don't notice, but to cut corners so that they make money,\" said Dr. John Spink, PHD, \u00a0Director and Assistant Professor, Food Fraud Initiative, Michigan State University.\nThe Food Fraud Initiative tracks cases of mislabeling, citing some involving certain brands of cheese, extra virgin olive oil, and seafood.\nTop chefs like MSNBC contributor Tom Collicchio say most people don't have the palate to tell the difference.\n\"We're finding it in olive oil. We're finding it in fish. There was a report the other day that most, something like 40 percent of the lobster that is in lobster dishes isn't lobster, it's other fish. And so we're seeing it all over. This is I think a big problem. Even in terms...[Content truncated]",

The President of the company is currently facing a hefty fine and prison time for  the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\nIt's really a kind of consumer fraud.\nWhile much of the media's focus has been on the wood pulp, cellulose is in fact a very common food additive. The legality has more to do with the fact that the cheese is improperly labeled: The FDA's  regarding Parmesan requires that each ingredient be listed on the label (with the exception of animal, plant or microbial enzymes, which can simply be declared \"enzymes\").\nNora Weiser, executive director of the American Cheese Society, says cellulose isn't found in wheels of cheese, but in shredded varieties, where it's used as an anti-caking agent. \"It is a legal, food-grade additive,\" she says. \"It keeps the grated cheese products from...[Content truncated]",
