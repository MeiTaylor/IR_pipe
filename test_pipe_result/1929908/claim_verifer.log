  "Claim": "Several widely-available cheeses are partially made from wood.",
  "Video_information": {'video_date': 20160218.0, 'platform': 'twitter', 'video_headline': 'This cheese company has been putting wood in their parmesan for 30 years', 'video_transcript': '', 'Video_descriptor': "The video showcases a man in a chef's attire starting in a kitchen, where he skillfully chops a block of cheese into small pieces. He then proceeds to mix the cheese with various ingredients in a pan, preparing a delectable dish. Throughout the video, scenes of pasta being cooked with green herbs and grated cheese are highlighted, adding to the culinary narrative. The key frames reveal snapshots of the cooking process, including the intricate details of pasta being sprinkled with grated cheese, suggesting a visually appealing dish in the making. Text overlays in the key frames add a playful or informative touch, with statements like 'THAT DOESN'T SOUND TOO GRATE' and 'CASTLE CHEESE IS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR MIXING WOOD PULP WITH THEIR PARMESAN CHEESE' contributing to the engaging content. References to popular culture, such as an image from the animated movie 'Ratatouille,' enhance the thematic elements around the art of cooking and the use of cheese as a central ingredient. The imagery of shredded cheese being tossed or sprinkled adds a dynamic element to the culinary narrative, with textual details providing historical context and intriguing insights such as 'CASTLE CHEESE HAS BEEN SUPPLYING IMITATION CHEESE FOR ALMOST 30 YEARS.' Scenes of individuals gratefully adding cheese to pasta dishes further emphasize the central role of cheese in the culinary creations depicted.

This statement highlights the practice of using wood pulp in cheese production, which aligns with the claim made. Thus, the video's content provides a strong basis for the truthfulness of the claim, although further verification from additional sources could increase confidence."

  "Task": "Determine if online information searching is needed to answer the new question. Consider the following criteria:

1. Online search is generally recommended for most questions to provide comprehensive and up-to-date information.
2. If the question can be fully and confidently answered using only the given 'Claim', 'Video_information', and 'QA_CONTEXTS', online search may not be necessary.
3. If the question specifically asks about details or content exclusively present in the video, online search may not be needed.
4. For any question that could benefit from additional context, background, or current information, online search is recommended.

Based on these criteria, determine if online search is needed (Yes or No). If online search could potentially provide any useful information or context, even if not strictly necessary, choose 'Yes'. Only choose 'No' if the question is entirely about specific video content that cannot be found online.

If the result is 'Yes', generate two new queries for Google Custom Search API. If 'No', do not provide any queries.

If generating queries:
- Ensure Query 1 and Query 2 focus on different aspects of the question and are not repetitive.
- Each query should be concise (not exceeding 10 words) and suitable for Google Custom Search API.
- Provide key terms that represent the core focus of each specific query. Key terms must be a single word.

Note: The generated queries should be phrases suitable for Google Search.

2024-08-01 20:30:19 - ThreadPoolExecutor-4_0 - INFO - Here are the evaluations for each of the listed websites based on their overall reliability, historical accuracy, and capability to detect and expose fake news, particularly in relation to the claim concerning the use of wood in parmesan cheese.

1. **time.com**
   - **Website Quality (website_quality): 9/10**
   - **Explanation:** Time is a reputable news magazine with a long history of journalism. It is known for its rigorous fact-checking and investigative reporting. Time regularly covers food industry issues and consumer health, making it a credible source for information regarding food safety and authenticity. It also has a history of addressing relevant controversies with accuracy.

2. **medium.com**
   - **Website Quality (website_quality): 6/10**
   - **Explanation:** Medium is a platform that allows anyone to publish articles, leading to a mix of high-quality and low-quality content. While there are credible voices on Medium, it's less controlled than traditional news outlets, and misinformation can spread. Articles often lack rigorous editorial oversight. Thus, its credibility can vary significantly based on the author and topic.

3. **www.eater.com**
   - **Website Quality (website_quality): 8/10**
   - **Explanation:** Eater is a well-regarded food and dining website that provides reliable information about the food industry, trends, and dining culture. It often covers controversies about food authenticity and safety. The site's focus on food-related journalism indicates it can provide credible insights into claims regarding food contents, including cheese.

4. **www.sokolovelaw.com**
   - **Website Quality (website_quality): 5/10**
   - **Explanation:** Sokolove Law is a law firm website that is not known primarily for journalistic integrity. While it may provide some useful information about food safety laws, it does not specialize in news reporting or fact-checking and could present a biased view in favor of legal advocacy rather than an objective analysis of food safety claims.

5. **www.reddit.com**
   - **Website Quality (website_quality): 4/10**
   - **Explanation:** Reddit is a user-generated content platform, and its credibility depends on the specific subreddit and the moderation in place. While it can be a source of breaking news and personal experiences, it lacks authoritative oversight and can spread misinformation. Its findings should be corroborated with more reliable sources.

6. **www.foodsafetynews.com**
   - **Website Quality (website_quality): 8/10**
   - **Explanation:** Food Safety News is a solid resource focusing specifically on food safety issues. It often reports on food recalls, investigations, and safety regulations, making it a credible partner when discussing food authenticity and safety, such as claims related to food containing wood products.

7. **www.washingtonpost.com**
   - **Website Quality (website_quality): 9/10**
   - **Explanation:** The Washington Post is a highly respected American news organization with a strong reputation for factual reporting and investigative journalism. It covers a wide range of issues, including those related to food and health. Its editorial standards and rigorous fact-checking support its credibility in reporting food-related claims.

8. **thecounter.org**
   - **Website Quality (website_quality): 7/10**
   - **Explanation:** The Counter is a food journalism site that focuses on the intersection of food, policy, and culture. It has done investigative work that reveals issues in the food industry, but it is smaller and less recognized than larger outlets. Still, its commitment to uncovering food-related truths lends credibility to its content.

9. **www.golomblegal.com**
   - **Website Quality (website_quality): 5/10**
   - **Explanation:** Similar to Sokolove Law, Golomb Legal is primarily a law firm website with a focus on legal issues rather than journalism. It may provide some relevant legal perspectives on food safety but lacks the journalistic rigor and reputation as an objective news source.

10. **www.quora.com**
    - **Website Quality (website_quality): 3/10**
    - **Explanation:** Quora is a question-and-answer platform where anyone can post answers. While it can contain valuable insights, the quality and accuracy of information can vary greatly. It does not offer the verification processes typical of journalism, making it unreliable for verifying claims in serious matters like food safety.

In summary, websites like Time, The Washington Post, and Eater are more credible for investigating claims about food authenticity, while platforms like Medium and Reddit present opportunities for misinformation or variable credibility.

1. **www.cbsnews.com**
   - **Score: 8/10**
   - **Explanation:** CBS News is a well-established news outlet known for its investigative journalism and adherence to journalistic standards. It has a history of producing reliable news content and is recognized for fact-checking and reporting on food safety issues. However, like many mainstream media outlets, it may sometimes prioritize sensationalism for engagement, which affects its overall score slightly.

2. **www.fda.gov**
   - **Score: 9/10**
   - **Explanation:** The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) is a federal agency with a primary focus on public health, particularly in regulating food safety and labeling. The information provided by the FDA is based on scientific research and is highly credible, making it an essential source for topics related to food ingredients. Its role in enforcing regulations enhances its reliability.

3. **www.wnep.com**
   - **Score: 6/10**
   - **Explanation:** WNEP is a local news station that covers a variety of topics, including food safety. While it offers timely news updates, local stations can sometimes lack the depth of analysis or investigative rigor compared to national outlets. Therefore, it's a decent source, though it may not always provide comprehensive investigations.

4. **www.chicagotribune.com**
   - **Score: 7/10**
   - **Explanation:** The Chicago Tribune is a long-standing newspaper known for its comprehensive news coverage and investigative journalism. Although it generally maintains quality reporting, local newspapers can have varying degrees of journalistic integrity, and it may not always match the rigor of larger national outlets.

5. **www.justice.gov**
   - **Score: 8/10**
   - **Explanation:** The U.S. Department of Justice provides information about enforcement actions and legal matters, including food safety regulations. Its credibility is high due to its governmental status, and it aims to inform the public about significant issues, including fraud in food production. Its responses are backed by legal frameworks, enhancing accuracy.

6. **www.wthr.com**
   - **Score: 6/10**
   - **Explanation:** WTHR is an Indiana-based local television news station. Like WNEP, it covers a wide range of news topics but may lack the depth needed for thorough investigations. The coverage provided may vary in quality and thoroughness based on the story.

7. **www.cdc.gov**
   - **Score: 9/10**
   - **Explanation:** The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides scientific data and information about health, including food safety. Its reliability is high due to its commitment to accurate and research-based data. The CDC often presents information on public health threats, which makes it a highly credible source.

8. **www.mcall.com**
   - **Score: 6/10**
   - **Explanation:** The Morning Call is a local news outlet that covers various topics, including food safety and local news. Similar to other local newspapers, it may not have the same resources as national outlets for in-depth investigative journalism. Its reporting may be accurate but is less rigorous compared to others on this list.

9. **www.theguardian.com**
   - **Score: 8/10**
   - **Explanation:** The Guardian is an internationally recognized news organization known for its investigative journalism and commitment to accuracy. It provides in-depth reporting on a range of topics, including food safety and public health. Its reputation for quality journalism lends itself to an overall high score.

10. **www.eater.com**
    - **Score: 7/10**
    - **Explanation:** Eater focuses primarily on food news, reviews, and culinary trends. It provides interesting insights into food culture but is often aimed at entertainment rather than hard news. While it can offer valuable information about food safety topics, its emphasis is less on investigation and more on lifestyle.

In summary, the evaluation indicated that official government sources like the FDA and CDC rank the highest for credibility and accuracy, with mainstream news organizations providing substantial validity but with varying degrees of reliability. Local news stations scored lower due to possible limitations in depth and resources for investigative journalism.

So, cellulose is not necessarily wood pulp. Nor is it inherently \u201cunsafe,\u201d as another media outlet, \u201cWomen\u2019s Health,\u201d reports in a story with a another alarming headline: \u201c.\u201d The story reports that \u201caccording to the Center for Dairy Research (CDR) in Madison, WI, cellulose is an inherently safe additive. But the problem is, it\u2019s gotten out of control. According to the CDR, two\u00a0to four\u00a0percent is a generally accepted safe level of the additive, but many brands are far exceeding that measure.\u201d **Is it really out of control? Not if you ask the FDA** Cellulose is a common ingredient, and it\u2019s not \u201cunsafe.\u201d\u00a0 In fact, the FDA officially classifies it as \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (GRAS) and  that \u201cconsumption of large amounts appear to have no effect other than providing dietary bulk.\u201d This official position \u2014 from the federal agency charged with regulating food safety \u2014 is a far cry from summaries of reports from lobby groups like the Center for Dairy Research. In short, the evidence is that Parmesan is not going to leave you swallowing splinters. And when we do have unsafe food, it\u2019s up to the FDA \u2014 not lobby groups, the media, or the courts \u2014 to address those issues. Take Castle Cheese Inc.,\u00a0which faced prosecution by the FDA over its \u201c100% grated Parmesan Cheese.\u201d \u00a0The FDA discovered Castle\u2019s Parmesan cheese failed to comply with the regulatory definition and barred further sale. The FDA, under its exclusive authority to enforce its regulations, filed criminal charges. But it wasn\u2019t a class action that led to FDA enforcement, and that\u2019s the right result, because these violations are the responsibility of the FDA and not consumer lawyers trolling the news for a quick payout. As the federal agency charged with protecting the food supply, the FDA has the science, resources, and knowledge to understand the often-complicated interplay between food safety, cost, and public health.\u00a0 But remember that the FDA responds to facts and science, not fads and tacky headlines. _**Jacob M.

FDA records show finished cheese was stored in an un-refrigerated room, which could cause bacteria to thrive.\\nWhat's more: the company found Listeria, a potentially deadly pathogen, in its production area ten times.  But Castle continued to produce and sell its cheese to stores like Target and Walmart without testing it. \\nThat might be troubling enough, but records from the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture -- which inspected Castle around the same time as the FDA -- tell a very different story.  \\nIn June 2012, state inspector David Trotter wrote: \\\"the plant continues to be in excellent condition.

2024-08-01 20:30:48 - ThreadPoolExecutor-4_0 - INFO - 1. **evidence0**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 10
   - **Justification**: This evidence directly states that Castle Cheese has been supplying parmesan cheese that contains no actual parmesan for almost 30 years and explicitly mentions the use of wood pulp in their products. This strongly supports the claim that Castle Cheese mixes wood pulp with their parmesan cheese.

2. **evidence1**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 8
   - **Justification**: While this evidence discusses wood pulp and lawsuits related to the labeling of parmesan cheese, it doesn’t specifically mention Castle Cheese mixing wood pulp into their parmesan. It hints at issues related to misleading labeling, which is relevant but less direct compared to evidence0.

3. **evidence2**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 9
   - **Justification**: This evidence states that Castle Cheese Inc. was found to have doctored parmesan cheese with cellulose (wood pulp) and has faced legal consequences for these actions. This supports the claim about the mixing of wood pulp in their products and is very relevant.

4. **evidence3**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 9
   - **Justification**: This evidence highlights that Castle Cheese added wood pulp to its parmesan products and faced legal action for fraud. This aligns directly with the claim, confirming that wood pulp was indeed used.

5. **evidence4**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 8
   - **Justification**: While this evidence discusses a fine related to the labeling practices of Castle Cheese, it is somewhat less specific than others regarding the direct mixing of wood pulp with parmesan. However, it confirms the issue of mislabeling, which is relevant.

6. **evidence5**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 7
   - **Justification**: This evidence touches on the use of cellulose in parmesan cheese but focuses more generally on legal issues without specifically tying it directly back to Castle Cheese's practices regarding mixing wood pulp. 

7. **evidence6**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 9
   - **Justification**: This evidence explains that Castle Cheese was cited for having products that did not contain real parmesan and were mixed with wood pulp. It is highly relevant as it directly confirms the claim.

8. **evidence7**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 7
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses the prevalence of wood pulp in cheese and ongoing legal battles but does not specifically focus on Castle Cheese or provide direct details about their practices. Thus, it is slightly less relevant.

9. **evidence8**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 10
   - **Justification**: This evidence clearly states that Castle Cheese was found to use wood pulp fillers and cheaper substitutes in its parmesan products. This information strongly corroborates the claim made in the video.

10. **evidence9**
    - **RelevanceScore**: 5
    - **Justification**: This evidence mentions concerns about wood pulp in processed parmesan but does not provide specific details about Castle Cheese or support the claim effectively, making it less relevant overall.

2024-08-01 20:30:50 - ThreadPoolExecutor-4_1 - INFO - Based on the analysis of each piece of evidence provided in relation to the question, here are the relevance scores:

1. **evidence0**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 8
   - **Justification**: This evidence reports on an FDA investigation uncovering that Castle Cheese was mixing other ingredients, including cellulose (wood pulp), in their cheese products. This directly supports the claim about Castle Cheese mixing wood pulp with their parmesan cheese.

2. **evidence1**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 4
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses an outbreak investigation but does not specifically mention Castle Cheese or its connection to wood pulp in parmesan. While it mentions cheese-related issues, it lacks direct relevance to the claim about wood pulp.

3. **evidence2**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 9
   - **Justification**: This evidence states that the FDA found Castle Cheese using cellulose, derived from wood pulp, in products labeled as “100 percent grated Parmesan cheese.” This is highly relevant and confirms the claim.

4. **evidence3**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 6
   - **Justification**: This evidence talks about mislabeling in grated Parmesan suppliers, though it does not specifically cite Castle Cheese as directly. It provides context but is less specific than other evidence.

5. **evidence4**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 5
   - **Justification**: The evidence reports on the sentencing of a Castle Cheese executive for marketing adulterated products but does not delve into specifics about wood pulp. Some value, but less directly relevant to the claim.

6. **evidence5**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 10
   - **Justification**: This piece provides a clear confirmation that Castle Cheese labeled its products as “100 percent Parmesan cheese” while they contained cellulose, which is derived from wood pulp. This is highly relevant and solidly backs the claim.

7. **evidence6**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 2
   - **Justification**: This evidence relates only tangentially to Parm cheese products and focuses on a different product type (Queso Fresco). It is not relevant to the current question.

8. **evidence7**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 7
   - **Justification**: This evidence describes Castle Cheese being found to sell products with cellulose and mislabeling them. While it doesn't focus exclusively on wood pulp, it offers insight into the cheeses involved and reinforces the fraudulent practices connected to Castle Cheese.

9. **evidence8**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 9
   - **Justification**: This article references the use of cellulose in Parmesan cheese made by Castle Cheese. It aligns well with the claim and provides context about the source of cellulose.

2024-08-01 20:31:12 - MainThread - INFO - ################## Question Answer Output (Attempt 1) ##################
2024-08-01 20:31:12 - MainThread - INFO - The video does not independently provide evidence that Castle Cheese mixes wood pulp with their parmesan cheese; however, it references claims of such practices. Evidence from several authoritative sources confirms that Castle Cheese was involved in producing parmesan cheese containing wood pulp. 

Specifically, the FDA has found that many cheeses labeled as “100 percent Parmesan” often contain fillers like wood pulp, and Castle Cheese is explicitly mentioned as a company that produced parmesan cheese without actual parmesan for nearly 30 years [Query1_evidence_1]. Furthermore, an FDA investigation highlighted that Castle Cheese labeled its products as parmesan while they included a mixture of various cheeses and ingredients not conforming to the legal definition of parmesan [Query1_evidence_2]. Additional sources corroborate that Castle Cheese has faced legal penalties related to mislabeling and the inclusion of cellulose (wood pulp) in their cheese products [Query1_evidence_3].

Therefore, while the video implies Castle Cheese's involvement with wood pulp in parmesan, the definitive evidence comes from external sources rather than the video itself. 

Confidence in this answer is approximately 90%, based on the reliability of the sourced evidence underlining the claims regarding Castle Cheese.

Just ask Seinfeld's George Costanza!\nBut an FDA investigation raising the question: what's in the cheese you're eating?\nThe agency targeted Castle Cheese, saying what the company labeled as \"100 percent\" Parmesan cheese was actually a blend of cheaper cheeses and \"cellulose\" - an organic filler which can be derived from wood pulp.\nBlasting the company in a letter, the FDA wrote, \"Your Parmesan cheese products do not contain any Parmesan cheese.\"\nThe company took corrective action but ended up filing for bankruptcy and could not be reached for comment.\nThe FDA allows up to four percent filler products like cellulose in cheese. But watchdogs warn that what's in the other 96 percent may not always be what we think.\nExperts say some companies go too far.\n\"A key is, with food fraud, is that the criminals are looking to make money.

FDA records show finished cheese was stored in an un-refrigerated room, which could cause bacteria to thrive.\nWhat's more: the company found Listeria, a potentially deadly pathogen, in its production area ten times.  But Castle continued to produce and sell its cheese to stores like Target and Walmart without testing it. \nThat might be troubling enough, but records from the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture -- which inspected Castle around the same time as the FDA -- tell a very different story.  \nIn June 2012, state inspector David Trotter wrote: \"the plant continues to be in excellent condition.

The imagery of shredded cheese being tossed or sprinkled adds a dynamic element to the culinary narrative, with textual details providing historical context and intriguing insights such as 'CASTLE CHEESE HAS BEEN SUPPLYING IMITATION CHEESE FOR ALMOST 30 YEARS.' Scenes of individuals gratefully adding cheese to pasta dishes further emphasize the central role of cheese in the culinary creations depicted. The varied settings, from traditional kitchen environments to blurred backgrounds, add depth and visual interest to the overall video, culminating in the man serving the finished dish on a plate, completing the engaging and informative culinary journey depicted."},
  "QA_CONTEXTS": {'Initial_Question_Generation': {'Question': 'Does the video provide evidence that Castle Cheese mixes wood pulp with their parmesan cheese?', 'Answer': "The video does not independently provide evidence that Castle Cheese mixes wood pulp with their parmesan cheese; however, it references claims of such practices. Evidence from several authoritative sources confirms that Castle Cheese was involved in producing parmesan cheese containing wood pulp.\n\nSpecifically, the FDA has found that many cheeses labeled as “100 percent Parmesan” often contain fillers like wood pulp, and Castle Cheese is explicitly mentioned as a company that produced parmesan cheese without actual parmesan for nearly 30 years [Query1_evidence_1]. Furthermore, an FDA investigation highlighted that Castle Cheese labeled its products as parmesan while they included a mixture of various cheeses and ingredients not conforming to the legal definition of parmesan [Query1_evidence_2]. Additional sources corroborate that Castle Cheese has faced legal penalties related to mislabeling and the inclusion of cellulose (wood pulp) in their cheese products [Query1_evidence_3].\n\nTherefore, while the video implies Castle Cheese's involvement with wood pulp in parmesan, the definitive evidence comes from external sources rather than the video itself.", 'Confidence': '90%'}},
