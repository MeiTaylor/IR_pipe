    "Initial_Question_Generation": {
        "Question": "Does the video provide evidence that Castle Cheese mixes wood pulp with their parmesan cheese?",
        "Answer": "The video does not independently provide evidence that Castle Cheese mixes wood pulp with their parmesan cheese; however, it references claims of such practices. Evidence from several authoritative sources confirms that Castle Cheese was involved in producing parmesan cheese containing wood pulp.\n\nSpecifically, the FDA has found that many cheeses labeled as “100 percent Parmesan” often contain fillers like wood pulp, and Castle Cheese is explicitly mentioned as a company that produced parmesan cheese without actual parmesan for nearly 30 years [Query1_evidence_1]. Furthermore, an FDA investigation highlighted that Castle Cheese labeled its products as parmesan while they included a mixture of various cheeses and ingredients not conforming to the legal definition of parmesan [Query1_evidence_2]. Additional sources corroborate that Castle Cheese has faced legal penalties related to mislabeling and the inclusion of cellulose (wood pulp) in their cheese products [Query1_evidence_3].\n\nTherefore, while the video implies Castle Cheese's involvement with wood pulp in parmesan, the definitive evidence comes from external sources rather than the video itself.",

    "CVResult": {
        "Judgment": "Yes",
        "Confidence": "90%",
        "Reason": "The existing information is sufficient to judge the truthfulness of the claim that several widely-available cheeses are partially made from wood. The video does not independently verify this claim but references an investigation into Castle Cheese's practices. External authoritative sources confirm that Castle Cheese has been involved in producing parmesan cheese containing fillers like wood pulp for nearly 30 years. Specifically, investigations by the FDA have implicated Castle Cheese in mislabeling products as parmesan while including non-parmesan fillers, including wood pulp. This combined evidence strongly supports the claim that wood pulp is used in the production of certain cheeses marketed as parmesan, leading to a high reliability probability of 90%."
