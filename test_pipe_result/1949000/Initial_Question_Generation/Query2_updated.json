The hands that dig into black Delta dirt belong to people like Willena Scott-White, African Americans who bear faces and names passed down from men and women who were owned here, who were kept here, and who chose to stay here, tending the same fields their forebears tended.\nBut some things have changed. Back in the day, snow-white bolls of King Cotton reigned. Now much of the land is green with soybeans. The farms and plantations are much larger\u2014industrial operations with bioengineered plants, laser-guided tractors, and crop-dusting drones. Fewer and fewer farms are still owned by actual farmers. Investors in boardrooms throughout the country have bought hundreds of thousands of acres of premium Delta land. If you\u2019re one of the millions of people who have a retirement account with the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, for instance, you might even own a little bit yourself.\nTIAA is one of the largest pension firms in the United States. Together with its subsidiaries and associated funds, it has a portfolio of more than 80,000 acres in Mississippi alone, most of them in the Delta. If the fertile crescent of Arkansas is included, TIAA holds more than 130,000 acres in a strip of counties along the Mississippi River. And TIAA is not the only big corporate landlord in the region. Hancock Agricultural Investment Group manages more than 65,000 acres in what it calls the \u201cDelta states.\u201d The real-estate trust Farmland Partners has 30,000 acres in and around the Delta. AgriVest, a subsidiary of the Swiss bank UBS, owned 22,000 acres as of 2011. (AgriVest did not respond to a request for more recent information.)\nUnlike their counterparts even two or three generations ago, black people living and working in the Delta today have been almost completely uprooted from the soil\u2014as property owners, if not as laborers. In Washington County, Mississippi, where last February TIAA reportedly bought 50,000 acres for more than $200 million, black people make up 72 percent of the population but own only 11 percent of the farmland, in part or in full. In Tunica County, where TIAA has acquired plantations from some of the oldest farm-owning white families in the state, black people make up 77 percent of the population but own only 6 percent of the farmland.

The idea being whenever something crazy happens to Fran, I\u2019ll (Harris Mayersohn) interview her (Fran Hoepfner) about it (Crazy Thing).\n**Hi Fran. I\u2019d love to start by asking the question on everyone\u2019s mind: What the hell is going on with your Crazy Life right now?**\nWell, on Monday, July 1st, I was diagnosed with mononucleosis, or as it\u2019s most commonly known, mono.\n]\nlife rocks, etc.\n**That\u2019s Fran\u2019s Crazy Life! Mono \u2014 some say that\u2019s the kissing disease, right? Passed through saliva?**\nYes.\n**Has me wondering, did you get mono from Hawk Tuah girl?**\nNo \u2014 given my limited access to the internet while in the Adirondacks, I resent that I know enough of who this is and her claim to spitting that I can refute this.\n**There\u2019s a \u201cDamn, Daniel\u201d-esque quality to \u201cHawk Tuah\u201d girl that I\u2019m legitimately enjoying. Plus, it\u2019s funny she hung out with Shaq a day after going viral. Which brings me back to the topic at hand: How long do you think this mono will be staying around?**\nMost people I know who have had it say it lasts between one and three months, which is to say if you thought you\u2019d be seeing me in July, well, that\u2019s probably not going to happen. I\u2019d like to think that given my commitment to \u201cchilling\u201d and \u201cnot doing a ton of recreational drinking,\u201d I\u2019ll be able to beat it sooner than later, but everything I\u2019ve read warns against trying to fight through it. You gotta just relinquish your life to the mono. At the time of our conversation, I\u2019ve had it for maybe almost three weeks?\n**This diagnosis was kind of a best - or maybe \u201cbetter\u201d - case scenario, right? We talked (off-record) in the run up to your medical discovery and there was a lot of uncertainty about what was going on.**\nNot to, like, violate my own HIPAA or whatever, but this all started because one of the lymph nodes in my neck just got huge out of...[Content truncated]",

Cooper, also known as Dan Cooper, was an unidentified man who hijacked Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 305, a Boeing 727 aircraft, in United States airspace on November 24, 1971. During the flight from Portland, Oregon, to Seattle, Washington, the hijacker told a flight attendant he had a bomb, demanded $200,000 in ransom (equivalent to approximately $1,500,000 in 2024[1][2]), and requested four parachutes upon landing in Seattle. After releasing the passengers in Seattle, the hijacker instructed the flight crew to refuel the aircraft and begin a second flight to Mexico City, with a refueling stop in Reno, Nevada. About 30 minutes after taking off from Seattle, the hijacker opened the aircraft's aft door, deployed the staircase, and parachuted into the night over southwestern Washington. The hijacker has never been found or identified conclusively.\n\nThe hijacker had identified himself as Dan Cooper to buy his one-way ticket in Portland, Oregon, but a reporter confused his name with another suspect and the hijacker became known subsequently as \"D. B. Cooper\".[3]\n\nIn 1980, a small portion of the ransom money was found along the banks of the Columbia River near Vancouver, Washington. The discovery of the money renewed public interest in the mystery but yielded no additional information about the hijacker's identity or...[Content truncated]",
