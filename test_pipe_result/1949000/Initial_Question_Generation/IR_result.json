(KABC) -- The teenager who filmed the viral \"Damn Daniel\" video and posted the clip on Twitter was the victim of a bogus emergency call that prompted police to swarm his family's Riverside home.\nPolice responded around 1 a.m. Tuesday after they received reports that someone at a residence on Hamilton Drive had shot their mother with an AK-47.\n\"A person called Riverside Police Department dispatch center and used some kind of a voice modification device and reported that he had shot his mother,\" Riverside police Lt. Kevin Townsend said.\nThe family cooperated with authorities, at which point police searched the home, cleared the scene and determined it was a false report.\n\"Swatting\" refers to a prank in which someone convinces authorities to dispatch an emergency response for a fake incident. Many celebrities have been victims of swatting, including Lil Wayne, Justin Timberlake and Miley Cyrus.\nTownsend said they've responded to a few swatting incidents that are usually spurred by revenge.\n\"They tend to be, for us, revenge in some way. Once we're able to track down who made the call, it's someone trying to get back at someone, whether it be an ex or something like that but that's what it seems like -- exes or teenagers,\" Townsend said.\nThe \"Damn Daniel\" video, which features a teenager following his friend around saying, \"Damn, Daniel,\" has been retweeted...[Content truncated]",

The hands that dig into black Delta dirt belong to people like Willena Scott-White, African Americans who bear faces and names passed down from men and women who were owned here, who were kept here, and who chose to stay here, tending the same fields their forebears tended.\nBut some things have changed. Back in the day, snow-white bolls of King Cotton reigned. Now much of the land is green with soybeans. The farms and plantations are much larger—industrial operations with bioengineered plants, laser-guided tractors, and crop-dusting drones. Fewer and fewer farms are still owned by actual farmers. Investors in boardrooms throughout the country have bought hundreds of thousands of acres of premium Delta land. If you’re one of the millions of people who have a retirement account with the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, for instance, you might even own a little bit yourself.\nTIAA is one of the largest pension firms in the United States. Together with its subsidiaries and associated funds, it has a portfolio of more than 80,000 acres in Mississippi alone, most of them in the Delta. If the fertile crescent of Arkansas is included, TIAA holds more than 130,000 acres in a strip of counties along the Mississippi River. And TIAA is not the only big corporate landlord in the region. Hancock Agricultural Investment Group manages more than 65,000 acres in what it calls the “Delta states.” The real-estate trust Farmland Partners has 30,000 acres in and around the Delta. AgriVest, a subsidiary of the Swiss bank UBS, owned 22,000 acres as of 2011. (AgriVest did not respond to a request for more recent information.)\nUnlike their counterparts even two or three generations ago, black people living and working in the Delta today have been almost completely uprooted from the soil—as property owners, if not as laborers. In Washington County, Mississippi, where last February TIAA reportedly bought 50,000 acres for more than $200 million, black people make up 72 percent of the population but own only 11 percent of the farmland, in part or in full. In Tunica County, where TIAA has acquired plantations from some of the oldest farm-owning white families in the state, black people make up 77 percent of the population but own only 6 percent of the farmland.

(KABC) -- The teenager who filmed the viral \"Damn Daniel\" video and posted the clip on Twitter was the victim of a bogus emergency call that prompted police to swarm his family's Riverside home.\nPolice responded around 1 a.m. Tuesday after they received reports that someone at a residence on Hamilton Drive had shot their mother with an AK-47.\n\"A person called Riverside Police Department dispatch center and used some kind of a voice modification device and reported that he had shot his mother,\" Riverside police Lt. Kevin Townsend said.\nThe family cooperated with authorities, at which point police searched the home, cleared the scene and determined it was a false report.\n\"Swatting\" refers to a prank in which someone convinces authorities to dispatch an emergency response for a fake incident. Many celebrities have been victims of swatting, including Lil Wayne, Justin Timberlake and Miley Cyrus.\nTownsend said they've responded to a few swatting incidents that are usually spurred by revenge.\n\"They tend to be, for us, revenge in some way. Once we're able to track down who made the call, it's someone trying to get back at someone, whether it be an ex or something like that but that's what it seems like -- exes or teenagers,\" Townsend said.\nThe \"Damn Daniel\" video, which features a teenager following his friend around saying, \"Damn, Daniel,\" has been retweeted...[Content truncated]"

    "QA": {
        "Question": "Does the video evidence support or contradict the claim that 'Damn Daniel' was mugged and robbed of his shoes?",
        "Answer": "The video evidence does not support the claim that 'Damn Daniel' was mugged and robbed of his shoes. Instead, the available evidence indicates that such reports are likely hoaxes and viral misinformation. According to a report from Business Insider, the claim that Daniel Lara was robbed for his sneakers was not true. It specifically mentions that the reports of him being hospitalized after being beaten and robbed were propagated by a satire website and were not factual. Additionally, the Washington Post highlights that there were claims circulating on social media about the 'Damn Daniel' meme, suggesting that he had been mugged. However, these claims appear to be part of a larger discussion around misinformation and have not been substantiated by credible sources. ABC7 provides context about the type of prank known as \"swatting,\" which the creator of 'Damn Daniel' became a victim of—but does not mention any incident involving mugging or robbery of shoes. This supports the idea that misinformation was spreading rather than actual events occurring regarding theft. In summary, the evidence clearly indicates that the claim of Daniel being mugged and robbed of his shoes is unfounded and likely a product of misinformation.",
