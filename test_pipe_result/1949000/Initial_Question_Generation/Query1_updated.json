One shooting incident resulted in the homicide of Jesus Duran-Maldonado in Commerce City on February 26, 2022. Another shooting incident resulted in the homicide of Christian Chirinos-Salazar in Denver on May 28, 2022. The defendants are also charged with numerous other counts including attempted homicide, aggravated motor vehicle theft, assault, menacing and robbery.\n\u201cWe believe these individuals shared a common goal of committing violence primarily against their rival gang members to gain notoriety, credibility, and perceived dominance over both their neighborhood,\u201d said Denver DA Beth McCann. \u201cThis is a very important development in our continuing efforts to keep the community safe from violent organized criminal activities and took a tremendous amount of work by members of my office as well as our law enforcement partners.

I cannot imagine Tracy\u2019s family forgiving me and would not ask that of them. But I owe them the chance to tell me just how badly I have ruined their lives; I am ready to do so, and want to.\nStill, I know that my saying, \u201cI am deeply sorry,\u201d will be insufficient. Perhaps the knowledge that I am doing all I can to help others escape our fate may reduce the pain just a little. Or maybe not.\nI struggle with guilt and shame. Guilt is the acknowledgment of having committed an act that is wrong or hurtful, while shame is a deep inner sense of personal unworthiness. Guilt is easier to deal with than shame; both are painful, but one is about the act and the other is about the person.\nI must accept guilt but reject shame.\nI am more than my worst act, yes. What I still need, though, is to somehow atone for what I have done. There is no perfect atonement, except for that which Christ paid on the cross. But I dream of somehow using my experience, my own story to reach other men who are in danger of doing what I have done\u2014before their own rage turns fatal. If I could save one man from doing what I did and save his loved one from Tracy\u2019s fate, then I will have found a calling for my final years.\nSome communities engage \u201cpeer advocates,\u201d or men who have committed domestic violence but have reformed, to intercept other men before they commit worse acts. (Just as it is often recovering addicts who make the best drug counselors.) This is what I\u2019d like to do.\nI may eventually get out, or I may die in here. I do not know where I will end up. I have limited choices. But among the choices I can make is this: to lend my voice to one of the most important conversations of our time, about empowering women. A voice from the side you rarely look to\u2014the abuser, who has done the awful deed, but who has the credibility to speak with candor and wisdom to other men in danger of destroying many, many lives.\nI think of King David, who himself committed murder, and his pleas of repentance in Psalm 51, which have been a refuge for millions of sinners: \u201cMy sacrifice is a broken and contrite heart,\u201d he said, \u201ca contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.\u201d\n_Daniel Adams, 58, is serving a life sentence at Deep...[Content truncated]",

(KABC) -- The teenager who filmed the viral \"Damn Daniel\" video and posted the clip on Twitter was the victim of a bogus emergency call that prompted police to swarm his family's Riverside home.\nPolice responded around 1 a.m. Tuesday after they received reports that someone at a residence on Hamilton Drive had shot their mother with an AK-47.\n\"A person called Riverside Police Department dispatch center and used some kind of a voice modification device and reported that he had shot his mother,\" Riverside police Lt. Kevin Townsend said.\nThe family cooperated with authorities, at which point police searched the home, cleared the scene and determined it was a false report.\n\"Swatting\" refers to a prank in which someone convinces authorities to dispatch an emergency response for a fake incident. Many celebrities have been victims of swatting, including Lil Wayne, Justin Timberlake and Miley Cyrus.\nTownsend said they've responded to a few swatting incidents that are usually spurred by revenge.\n\"They tend to be, for us, revenge in some way. Once we're able to track down who made the call, it's someone trying to get back at someone, whether it be an ex or something like that but that's what it seems like -- exes or teenagers,\" Townsend said.\nThe \"Damn Daniel\" video, which features a teenager following his friend around saying, \"Damn, Daniel,\" has been retweeted...[Content truncated]",
