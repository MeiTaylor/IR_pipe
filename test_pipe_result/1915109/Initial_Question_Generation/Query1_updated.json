One can only hope that he continues telling tales for many years to come.\n!\nGeorge Orwell\u2019s _Animal Farm_ is famous for the quote \u201cSome animals are more equal than others.\u201d Someone should write an update called _American Farm_ that includes the line _\u201cSome hate crimes are more equal than others\u201d_ after the Washington, D.C., attack of war hero Christopher Marquez.\nMost media outlets have not covered the Feb. 12 attack of Marquez, who served eight years on active duty between 2003 and 2011. In short, the Bronze Star recipient sat down to eat in a McDonald\u2019s in the nation\u2019s capital and was accosted by a group of teens demanding to know if he thought \u201cblack lives matter.\u201d\nLike most sane people, he tried to ignore them and just eat his burger. _He was promptly ambushed and robbed upon exiting the restaurant._\n\u201cI believe this was a hate crime and I was targeted because of my skin color,\u201d Marquez told the  Feb. 15. \u201cToo many of these types of attacks have been happening against white people by members of the black community and the majority of the mainstream media refuses to report on it.\u201d\n!\nSuspects arrested in connection with Christopher Marquez\u2019s assault and robbery will not be charged with a hate crime, despite harassing him with racial questions prior to their attack.

Cops finally arrested and charge two individuals in connection with the incident, but _they  \u2014 even though they were explicitly harassing him about race and calling him \u201cracist\u201d before the attack._\n2.  President Obama, who always seems eager to weigh in on race-related crimes, _somehow can\u2019t find his voice when it comes to Black Lives Matter supporters who beat a Marine veteran unconscious and stole $400, a VA medical card, and three credit cards from his back pocket just miles from the White House._ What did his assailants spend the stolen cash on, you ask? Answer: liquor, a Five Guys burgers, and products from Walmart.\nRegular readers of this blog may remember the case of , who was attacked by a similar group of kids on the DC Metro Green Line in 2011.
