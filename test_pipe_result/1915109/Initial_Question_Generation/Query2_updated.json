Bradley Kasal out of Fallujah\u2019s infamous \"Hell House.\"\n\"Coming back here and being attacked by the people that we're supposed to protect \u2013 it's kind of ironic, I guess,\" Christopher Marquez told Marine Corps Times.\n\"It's very ironic: being attacked by the people you're there to serve,\" Christopher Marquez told Marine Corps Times.\nChristopher Marquez, who served in the Marine Corps from 2003 to 2011, told police he was assaulted on Friday around 10:30 p.m.\u00a0eb. 12 while eating at a McDonald's, according to a Metropolitan Police Department report of the incident. The suspects took Marquez\u2019 wallet, identification, credit cards, debit card and about $400 in cash, the report says.\n\"When we\u2019re in the military, we\u2019re there for our country,\" Marquez told Marine Corps Times. \"...It\u2019s very ironic: being attacked by the people you're\u00a0\\ there to serve.\"\nMarquez said told Marine Corps Times that he believes the attack was racially motivated. He remembers being accosted at the McDonald's in Washington's Chinatown neighborhood by five people between 16 and 21 years old. Most were men or boys. One may have been female.\n\"The kids were asking me if I think that black lives mattered,\" Marquez...[Content truncated]",

Please use your discretion._\nWASHINGTON (WUSA9/USA TODAY) -- Surveillance video has been released in the assault and robbery of a veteran Marine sergeant at a McDonald's in D.C.\nPolice are looking for at least four people in connection with the assault and robbery of Christopher Marquez. Marquez is a Bronze Star recipient, who was one of two Marines who helped carry then-1st Sgt. Bradley Kasal out of Fallujah\u2019s infamous \u201cHell House\u201d, according to USA Today.\nMarquez, who served in the Marine Corps from 2003 to 2011, told police he was assaulted on Friday around 10:30 p.m. while eating at a McDonald's, according to a Metropolitan Police Department report.\nMarquez said he believes the attack was racially motivated. USA Today says he remembers being accosted at the McDonald's in Washington's Chinatown neighborhood by five people between 16 and 21-years-old. Most were men or boys. One may have been female.\n\u201cThe kids were asking me if I think that black lives mattered,\u201d Marquez told USA Today on Monday. \u201cI was ignoring them, just because I felt intimidated. I felt how they approached me, it was very hostile. I felt they were really trying to intimidate me and just trying to start a confrontation with me.\u201d\nThe suspects took Marquez\u2019 wallet, identification, credit cards, debit card and about $400 in cash, the police report said.\n_If you can't see the below video, click ._\nAnyone who has information regarding this case should call police at 202-727-9099.

Tritten\nTravis J. Tritten\nStars and Stripes \u2022 February 23, 2016\n* * *\n! \nSgt. Chris Marquez, left, and Cpl. Dane Shaffer, two of the three Marines the \"Hell House\" statue is based on, help unveil the new monument at the Warrior Hope and Care Center at Camp Lejeune, March 8, 2013. (U.S. Marines)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Police made two arrests Monday following the assault earlier this month of a decorated Marine outside a fast-food restaurant in Washington, D.C.\nA 17-year-old male was charged with aggravated assault and a 17-year-old female was charged with robbery. Both are from Washington and were not named by police due to their age.\nA third person was suspected in the Feb. 12 attack, which victim Christopher Marquez said was racially motivated. Police said the investigation is continuing.\n\u201cThe kids were asking me if I think that black lives mattered,\u201d Marquez told USA Today this month. \u201cI was ignoring them, just because I felt intimidated. I felt how they approached me, it was very hostile. I felt they were really trying to intimidate me and just trying to start a confrontation with me.\u201d\nA surveillance video released by police last week shows a black male assailant in a white tank top punch Marquez in the head from behind as Marquez walked out of a McDonald\u2019s on E Street across from FBI headquarters, according to police.\nMarquez, 30, is a Bronze Star with \u201cV\u201d device recipient who fought in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2004 and served until 2011.\nAfter being punched, Marquez fell to the ground where he was robbed by the female suspect and then kicked in the head, police said.\nMarquez was one of three Marines in an iconic photo taken during the second battle of Fallujah. He was photographed carrying a fellow Marine whose uniform is blood-soaked from a wound during the so-called Hell House battle during which one Marine was killed and 10 were wounded.\n _Twitter: _\nstripes Administrator\nstripes Administrator\n### Subscribe to Stars and Stripes\nJust 99c a week! \n* * *\nstars and stripes videos\n------------------------\n* * *\naround the web\n--------------\n* * *\nstripes top news\n----------------\n]\n### \n]\n...[Content truncated]",

                    "Relevance Justification": "The report notes that two arrests were made in relation to the assault, confirming some level of corroboration for the incident. It discusses Marquez's feelings about the racial aspect, which aligns with the claim, although it does not detail witness accounts, keeping it from a perfect score."
