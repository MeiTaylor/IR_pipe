    "Judgment": "Yes",
    "Confidence": "95%",
    "Reason": "The existing information provides a clear direct quote from Donald Trump where he states, 'April Fools America. I'm not really running for president. It was a joke.' This statement explicitly confirms that Trump characterized his campaign announcement as an April Fool's joke. Given that the video is dated April 1, 2016, which aligns with the April Fool's Day theme, the context suggests that he intended to convey this joke during his public address. Although it is crucial to note that it was an actual campaign, in the context of the speech, he refers to it humorously as not being a serious endeavor. This evidence strongly supports the claim that Trump announced that his 2016 Presidential campaign was an April Fool's Day joke."
