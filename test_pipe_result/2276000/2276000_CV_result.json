It was made just a couple of hours ago that could make you question everything you know about the state of American politics. 9 months ago, I announced my candidacy for president. The journey has been an unbelievably interesting one and fascinating, but it's also been a real wake up call. Our country is totally divided. There's so much hatred. So that's what I made my campaign about. I said the craziest things I could think of. He referred to my hands. If they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee you. Things you never heard at candidates say. I love the poorly educated. But I will tell you this, and I can say it with certainty. I had no idea it would go this far. No matter how insane I got, millions of you showed up to support me. Me, the guy who hosted The Apprentice and sold steaks, but enough is enough. It has to be stopped. It has to be stopped now. April Fools America. I'm not really running for president. It was a joke. You're so stupid. It's mind boggling. It really is. Now go vote for my friend, Hillary Clinton, and make America great again.

    "CVResult": {
        "Judgment": "Yes",
        "Confidence": "95%",
        "Reason": "The existing information provides a clear direct quote from Donald Trump where he states, 'April Fools America. I'm not really running for president. It was a joke.' This statement explicitly confirms that Trump characterized his campaign announcement as an April Fool's joke. Given that the video is dated April 1, 2016, which aligns with the April Fool's Day theme, the context suggests that he intended to convey this joke during his public address. Although it is crucial to note that it was an actual campaign, in the context of the speech, he refers to it humorously as not being a serious endeavor. This evidence strongly supports the claim that Trump announced that his 2016 Presidential campaign was an April Fool's Day joke."

    "Final_Judgement": {
        "Answer": "False",
        "Reasons": "In the provided video transcript, Donald Trump clearly states, 'April Fools America. I'm not really running for president. It was a joke.' This indicates that the claim is a misinterpretation of the context. The video shows Trump announcing his campaign but also reveals it was an April Fool's joke, which contradicts the claim that it was just a joke rather than an official announcement which later led to his candidacy for president. Furthermore, the portrayal surrounding the event indicates a serious political campaign, making it clear that while he joked about it, he was indeed running for president that year. Therefore, the claim that he announced the candidacy as a joke is false because it overlooks the reality of the campaign that followed [Follow_Up_Question_1_Query 1_evidence_1].",
