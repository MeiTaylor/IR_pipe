But today’s the day!\nIn today’s video, we’re going to look at all three movements – yes, there are three movements, beyond the iconic slow first movement – and talk a little history and analysis.\nThe purpose of this video is to give you a deeper insight into this lovely sonata, whether or not you’re a music nerd or everyday general music fan. We’ll play clips from the piece so you can get a sense of what it sounds like, and talk a bit of history, theory and style.\nLet’s get to it!\nMoonlight Sonata by Beethoven: General info\n-------------------------------------------\nThe actual title for Moonlight Sonata by Beethoven is “Piano Sonata no. 14 in C# minor, op. 27 no. 2”. It was written in 1801, and aside from being popular over 200 years later, it was pretty well-loved in Beethoven’s day as well.\nIt wasn’t always called “Moonlight Sonata” – on the first edition, Beethoven gave the piece an Italian subtitle, “_Sonata quasi una fantasia”,_ which translates to something like “Sonata almost like a fantasy” (A fantasy is another music genre, and much more improvisational).\n]\nShortly after Beethoven’s death, a well-known music critic named Ludwig Rellstab made the comment that the first movement sounded like moonlight shining upon Lake Lucerne. That comment caught fire, and within a decade it was already being published as “Moonlight Sonata”.\nInspiration for Moonlight Sonata by Beethoven\n---------------------------------------------\nFrederic Chopin was said to have been inspired to write his Fantaisie-Impromtu because of this piece, as a tribute to Beethoven. I love this quote by Enst Oster, who writes,\n> “… With the aid of the Fantaisie-Impromptu we can at least recognize what particular features of the C♯ minor Sonata struck fire in Chopin. We can actually regard Chopin as our teacher as he points to the coda and says, ‘Look here, this is great. Take heed of this example!’ … The Fantaisie-Impromptu is perhaps the only instance where one genius discloses to us — if only by means of a composition of his own — what he actually hears in the work of another genius.”\nThe title “Moonlight” sonata makes it sound like this is a rather romantic sonata, and people have speculated that it was meant as a sort of love song to Giulietta Guicciardi, Be...[Content truncated]",

Paul, the son of a musician, could play guitar, drums, piano and bass. He started on trumpet. Ringo was, in my opinion, one of the greatest rock drummers in the world. George, my favorite Beatle growing up, was the band's instrumentalist and played the most beautiful structured phrases on the guitar. And John once confided in an interview that he thought that he was an even better guitar player than George.\nBy the way, I don't think any of the Fab Four were great readers of music. _Not that it mattered.._.  \nBut could it be possible that the best musician of the entire clan was actually Yoko Ono? She certainly had the most classical training.  \n]\nI put the Gary McFarland (1933-1971)  of the Beatles' tune _Because_ up on the blog last week.

Yoko was playing some classical bit, and I said, 'Play that backwards.' Yoko and I stimulate each other like crazy.\"  Lennon gave more details to the event in a radio interview from September of that year, saying, \"I said give me them chords backwards and I wrote 'Because' on top of it. I don't know whether it was Beethoven or something.\" Then, in the background, Yoko voice is heard saying \"Moonlight Sonata.\"  The piece that Yoko was playing actually turns out to be the Adagio sostenuto of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 14, Op. 27 No. 2 (Moonlight) in C sharp minor.

You're the one playing it and you should play it your way. During that period of time and in that room, you own the piece and it's yours to play how you want to play it.\n    – \n    Commented Mar 10, 2016 at 11:50\n*   @Todd Wilcox, thanks. Yes, audience will never notice differences between non-legato and legato melody with pedal, because there are no differences in sound. But I'm interested why teachers and good pianist give such advices to play melody legato. For example, Robert Estrin on youtube also say play Moonlight Sonata (1st mov.) legato with fingers when practice, pedal is **the last thing to add**. And I don't understand which profit I will get? Why I can't just relax and use pedal from beginning of practice?..\n    – user15155\n    Commented Mar 10, 2016 at 12:28\n*   @Corvus- I suspect the \"profit you will get\" is meant to be not how the Moonlight Sonata will sound as...[Content truncated]",
