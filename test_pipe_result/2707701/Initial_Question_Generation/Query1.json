Beethoven was born in the _classical music era_, where music was **balanced, clean and elegant**. He transformed it into the _romantic era_, where music is full of **energy and passion**. Beetles, similarly took the simple and bare rock-n-roll music of the ‘50s and transformed it into the so-called _popular music_. They **influenced the songwriters** to be more creative, more sophisticated and have more freedom.\n|Related: \nIt was Beatles producer  who time-to-time **influenced their music with some classical touch**. He was the man behind _Yesterday_’s string quartets arrangement or the heavy presence of brass, strings and woodwinds in _Abbey Road_.  **_Because_ was different**, it came from an inspiring moment and **completely from Yoko Ono and Lennon**.\nYoko Ono was trained in classical music and piano play. **One day she played on her piano Beethoven’s ** with John Lennon listening in the background. At the end of the play Lennon asked **if she could play it backwards**. Not meaning each note – of course! Rather talking about the arpeggios instead of going up, go down or the other way around. Inserted some base notes and played along. He also **follows the key and key changes** Beethoven did in the Moonlight.\nNow, all he needed is some lyrics. Most probably he was **inspired by the roundness of the music**, how it goes and turns **in circles**. From this, probably he remembered the Earth and how it turns and it lead to _Because the world is round, it turns me on…_\n* * *\n### Related articles\n1.  ]\n2.  ]\n3.  ]\n4.  ]\nTags , \nEditor's pick\n-------------\n]\n]\nNewsletter\n----------\n]\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe!\nExplore\n-------\n*   ]\n    ### \n*   ]\n    ### \n*   ]\n    ### \n*   ]\n    ### \n*   ]\n    ### \n*   ]\n    ### \n*   ]\n    ### \n*   ]\n    ### \n*   ]\n    ### \n*   ]\n    ### \n*   ]\n    ### \n*   ]\n    ### \n!\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe!\n© 2024 Popular Beethoven • Built with ",

Suddenly, I said, 'Can you play those chords backward?' She did, and I wrote 'Because' around them. The song sounds like 'Moonlight Sonata,' too. The lyrics are clear, no bullshit, no imagery, no obscure references.\"]#cite_note-FOOTNOTES...[Content truncated]",

It seems there is usually some song in my head at nearly any time.  When I hear certain songs, I’ll sometimes think or say **“Ooh! That’s one of my all-time favorites!”** The range of my favorites is broad and diverse. These songs might be popular or obscure, from Broadway or the back roads, simple or complex, ballads or rockers.\nI hope that you will enjoy my blogging exploration of contenders for my all-time-favorite songs and that **you’ll** be moved to consider and share your own favorites that have held a timeless presence in the soundtrack of your life, or rather, your own personal **_Songbook_**.\n\\--- _**Enjoy!**_ ---\nThe choice for the next entry in “My All-time Greatest Songs” is the _**Beatles’**_ **“Because.”** So much has been researched, written, and said about the Beatles’ music that their creative output can seem like a blur. Still, **“Because”** stands out to me.\nThe Beatles’ first recording as their established four-member group was in August, 1962. Their last recording was in August, 1969. So, all the Beatles’ incredible body of work as a group took place in only seven years. In that brief time they became the best-selling band in history, with estimated worldwide sales of over 800 million albums. So much musical genius so fast! Of course, the individual Beatles (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr) went on to produce a tremendous amount of amazing music, but their collective impact is unmatched.\n“Because” is a beautiful composition, but It’s the arrangement, harmonies, and recording techniques that make it a masterpiece. John Lennon wrote the music and lyrics for “Because” in July, 1969, while enjoying some time alone with Yoko Ono. As the story goes, Yoko, an accomplished pianist, was playing Beethoven’s 1803 “Moonlight Sonata No. 14” piece, known variously as Piano Sonata in C-sharp minor (Opus 27,...[Content truncated]",

To this day, she tells me, she hasn't met a baby who isn't captivated by music.\nI am the oldest of five, and music is in my family's bones. Classical music was as woven through the fabric of my childhood as rock, folk, blues, and many other genres. There were different kinds of music in our house for different kinds of moods. My mother played classical radio when she wanted a moment of calm or when we dressed up and had tea parties; the Beatles and the Beach Boys crooned when she was feeling playful, and she tended to turn to Frank Sinatra and traditional Celtic tunes when she felt nostalgic.\nWhenever my mother had an opportunity to sit down at a piano, she played the opening lines of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata in the most beautiful, melancholy way. It made me feel in awe of her, that she could play something so beautifully and entirely captivating. I yearned with my whole body and imagination to be able to create something like that.\nThe first song I learned to sing was \"Baa Baa Black Sheep\" — the old French melody \"Ah! Vous Dirai-Je, Maman,\" on which many composers have written variations (perhaps most famously, Mozart). I was about 2 years old when I first sang it in its entirety, and if my mother's story is to be trusted, my rendition went something like this:\n\"Baa baa deet, habool, yetoo, yetoo, reek, rack, roll!\"\nAs I grew up, I had the fascinating experience of watching my little siblings develop and grow into their own musical identities over the years. The first time I saw my little sister sing her first song all the way through, I understood the magic of that moment. I understood why my mother had told me that story of \"Baa Baa Deet\" so many times over the years.\nI practiced classical music pieces for the litany of music lessons I took over my growing up years. I learned Gershwin, Vivaldi, Handel, and so many other composers as I sang and practiced their lines over and over through years of choir and band rehearsals, violin, guitar, oboe, and voice lessons. By the time I was in early high school I had taught myself a few songs on the piano — including Beethoven's \"Fur Elise...[Content truncated]",
