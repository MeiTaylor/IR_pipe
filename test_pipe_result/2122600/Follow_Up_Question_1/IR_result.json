With the growing availability of genomic tools and advancements in genomic analyses, it is becoming increasingly clear that gene flow between divergent taxa can generate new phenotypic diversity, allow for adaptation to novel environments, and contribute to speciation. Hybridization can have immediate phenotypic consequences through the expression of hybrid vigor. On longer evolutionary time scales, hybridization can lead to local adaption through the introgression of novel alleles and transgressive segregation and, in some cases, result in the formation of new hybrid species. Studying both the abundance and the evolutionary consequences of hybridization has deep historical roots in plant biology. Many of the hypotheses concerning how and why hybridization contributes to biological diversity currently being investigated were first proposed tens and even hundreds of years ago. In this Update, we discuss how new advancements in genomic and genetic tools are revolutionizing our ability to document the occurrence of and investigate the outcomes of hybridization in plants.\nIn natural populations, hybridization can act in opposition to divergence, introduce adaptive variation into a population, drive the evolution of stronger reproductive barriers, or generate new lineages. Hybridization is purposefully employed in the breeding of domesticated plants to take advantage of transient hybrid vigor, move desirable variation among lineages, and generate novel phenotypes.

HHS will likely increase in frequency as ecological and geographical barriers between species are continuing to be disrupted by human activities. HHS requires the establishment of reproductive isolation between a hybrid and its parents, but the underlying genes and genetic mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we reveal by integrated approaches that reproductive isolation originates in one homoploid hybrid plant species through the inheritance of alternate alleles at genes that determine parental premating isolation. The parent species of this hybrid species are reproductively isolated by differences in flowering time and survivorship on soils containing high concentrations of iron. We found that the hybrid species inherits alleles of parental isolating major genes related to flowering time from one parent and alleles of major genes related to iron tolerance from the other parent. In this way, it became reproductively isolated from one parent by the difference in flowering time and from the other by habitat adaptation (iron tolerance). These findings and further modeling results suggest that HHS may occur relatively easily via the inheritance of alternate parental premating isolating genes and barriers.\n    \n\n\n          Keywords:\n        \n      \n      alternate alleles; genetic mechanism; hybrid speciation; parental species; reproductive isolation.\n    \n\n    Copyright © 2021 The Author.

This review provides an overview of recent advances in understanding why plant polyploid species are so ubiquitous and diverse. We consider how the modern framework for understanding genetic mechanisms of speciation could be used to study allopolyploid speciation that occurs through hybrid genome doubling, that is, whole genome doubling of interspecific F1 hybrids by the union of male and female unreduced gametes. We outline genetic and ecological mechanisms that may have positive or negative impacts on the process of allopolyploid speciation through hybrid genome doubling. We also discuss the current status of studies on the underlying genetic mechanisms focusing on the wheat (Triticum and Aegilops) hybrid-specific reproductive phenomena that are well known but deserve renewed attention from an evolutionary viewpoint.\n**Keywords:** Allopolyploidization; Gametocidal genes; Hybrid dysgenesis; Kr genes; Polyploid genome alteration; Reproductive barriers; Uniparental chromosome elimination; Unreduced gamete production.\n© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

                "content": "!\nProvided\nThe recent decoding of the kiwifruit genome has discovered that the fruit has many genetic similarities to other plant species, including potatoes and tomatoes, among other surprises.\nA new study that decoded the DNA sequence of the kiwifruit has concluded that the fruit has many genetic similarities between its 39,040 genes and other plant species, including potatoes and tomatoes. The study also has unveiled two major evolutionary events that occurred millions of years ago in the kiwifruit genome.\n“The kiwifruit is an economically and nutritionally important fruit crop. It has long been called ‘the king of fruits’ because of its remarkably high vitamin C content and balanced nutritional composition of minerals, dietary fiber and other health-benefits,” says , a scientist from the Boyce Thompson Institute at Cornell who contributed heavily to study, which was conducted by a team of plant scientists from the United States and China and published Oct. 18 in Nature Communications.\n“The genome sequence will serve as a valuable resource for kiwifruit research and may facilitate the breeding program for improved fruit quality and disease resistance,” Fei says.\nKiwifruit originated from the mountains and ranges of southwestern China and was not really known to the world until the early 20th century, when farmers in New Zealand discovered the fruit and began breeding it as a commercial crop. It is a form of berry that grows on woody vines, much like grapes, and belongs to the order of Ericales, where blueberries, tea bushes and Brazil nuts are also classified.\nOne of the most remarkable findings of the study was uncovered when scientists observed a high percentage of similarities within the kiwifruit DNA. The data revealed two unusual mishaps that occurred in the process of cell division about 27 and 80 million years ago, when an extensive expansion of genes arose from an entire extra copy of the genome, followed by extensive gene loss.\nFei explains, “The kiwifruit genome has undergone two recent whole-genome duplication events.”\nWhen genes are duplicated, the extra genes can mutate to perform entirely new functions that were not previously present in the organism. This process, called neofunctionalization, can occur with no adverse effects in plants and, in the case of kiwifruit, was...[Content truncated]",

In this study, we reveal by integrated approaches that reproductive isolation originates in one homoploid hybrid plant species through the inheritance of alternate alleles at genes that determine parental premating isolation. The parent species of this hybrid species are reproductively isolated by differences in flowering time and survivorship on soils containing high concentrations of iron. We found that the hybrid species inherits alleles of parental isolating major genes related to flowering time from one parent and alleles of major genes related to iron tolerance from the other parent. In this way, it became reproductively isolated from one parent by the difference in flowering time and from the other by habitat adaptation (iron tolerance). These findings and further modeling results suggest that HHS may occur relatively easily via the inheritance of alternate parental premating isolating genes and barriers.\n    \n\n\n          Keywords:\n        \n      \n      alternate alleles; genetic mechanism; hybrid speciation; parental species; reproductive isolation.\n    \n\n    Copyright © 2021 The Author.

            "content": "!\nProvided\nThe recent decoding of the kiwifruit genome has discovered that the fruit has many genetic similarities to other plant species, including potatoes and tomatoes, among other surprises.\nA new study that decoded the DNA sequence of the kiwifruit has concluded that the fruit has many genetic similarities between its 39,040 genes and other plant species, including potatoes and tomatoes. The study also has unveiled two major evolutionary events that occurred millions of years ago in the kiwifruit genome.\n“The kiwifruit is an economically and nutritionally important fruit crop. It has long been called ‘the king of fruits’ because of its remarkably high vitamin C content and balanced nutritional composition of minerals, dietary fiber and other health-benefits,” says , a scientist from the Boyce Thompson Institute at Cornell who contributed heavily to study, which was conducted by a team of plant scientists from the United States and China and published Oct. 18 in Nature Communications.\n“The genome sequence will serve as a valuable resource for kiwifruit research and may facilitate the breeding program for improved fruit quality and disease resistance,” Fei says.\nKiwifruit originated from the mountains and ranges of southwestern China and was not really known to the world until the early 20th century, when farmers in New Zealand discovered the fruit and began breeding it as a commercial crop. It is a form of berry that grows on woody vines, much like grapes, and belongs to the order of Ericales, where blueberries, tea bushes and Brazil nuts are also classified.\nOne of the most remarkable findings of the study was uncovered when scientists observed a high percentage of similarities within the kiwifruit DNA. The data revealed two unusual mishaps that occurred in the process of cell division about 27 and 80 million years ago, when an extensive expansion of genes arose from an entire extra copy of the genome, followed by extensive gene loss.\nFei explains, “The kiwifruit genome has undergone two recent whole-genome duplication events.”\nWhen genes are duplicated, the extra genes can mutate to perform entirely new functions that were not previously present in the organism. This process, called neofunctionalization, can occur with no adverse effects in plants and, in the case of kiwifruit, was...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What biological or genetic mechanisms are needed for true hybridization between banana and kiwi?",
        "Answer": "To achieve true hybridization between banana (Musa spp.) and kiwi (Actinidia spp.), several biological and genetic mechanisms are necessary:\n\n1. **Genetic Compatibility**: For hybridization to occur, the two species must be genetically compatible, allowing for the successful mixing of their genetic material. This often means they should have similar chromosome numbers and structures, which is essential for viable hybrid offspring. The presence of reproductive barriers, both prezygotic (such as incompatible flowering times and pollination mechanisms) and postzygotic (such as hybrid sterility), can prevent such hybridization from successfully taking place.\n\n2. **Hybridization Mechanisms**: Proven methods of hybridization often involve controlled breeding techniques such as cross-pollination, where pollen from one species fertilizes the ovules of another. Modern genetic research has shown that hybrid species can arise through various mechanisms, including homoploid hybrid speciation (where the hybrid has the same number of chromosomes as both parent species), which relies on the establishment of reproductive isolation between the hybrid and its parent species.\n\n3. **Roadmap for Genetic Engineering**: Advances in genomic tools have revealed that significant gene flow between divergent taxa can lead to unique phenotypic traits and even the formation of new species through hybridization. If hybridization between banana and kiwi were to be considered, targeted genetic engineering could elucidate traits from both parent plants that could be beneficial. This might involve modifying genes that govern traits like flowering time and fruit characteristics, facilitating hybridization efforts.\n\n4. **Understanding of Genomes**: Recent studies revealing the genetic constitution of kiwi underscore the complexity within even closely related plant species. With both banana and kiwi demonstrating evolutionary adaptations across millions of years, thorough knowledge of each species’ genomic structure and evolutionary history would be critical for any successful hybridization attempts.\n\nIn summary, true hybridization between banana and kiwi would necessitate genetic compatibility, effective hybridization mechanisms, insight into genetic engineering opportunities, and comprehensive genomic understanding.",
