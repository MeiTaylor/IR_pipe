HHS will likely increase in frequency as ecological and geographical barriers between species are continuing to be disrupted by human activities. HHS requires the establishment of reproductive isolation between a hybrid and its parents, but the underlying genes and genetic mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we reveal by integrated approaches that reproductive isolation originates in one homoploid hybrid plant species through the inheritance of alternate alleles at genes that determine parental premating isolation. The parent species of this hybrid species are reproductively isolated by differences in flowering time and survivorship on soils containing high concentrations of iron. We found that the hybrid species inherits alleles of parental isolating major genes related to flowering time from one parent and alleles of major genes related to iron tolerance from the other parent. In this way, it became reproductively isolated from one parent by the difference in flowering time and from the other by habitat adaptation (iron tolerance). These findings and further modeling results suggest that HHS may occur relatively easily via the inheritance of alternate parental premating isolating genes and barriers.\n    \n\n\n          Keywords:\n        \n      \n      alternate alleles; genetic mechanism; hybrid speciation; parental species; reproductive isolation.\n    \n\n    Copyright © 2021 The Author.

Additionally, Haartman also found that interspecific hybrids between Thalictrum sp. were intermediate regarding the number of stamens and pistils (Haartman [1764]). So, by the mid of the eighteenth century, although poorly understood, plant hybridization was known as a phenomenon that could yield sterile plants with intermediate phenotypes.\nHowever, it was Kölreuter who began with the systematic study of plant hybridization. This author performed crosses between Nicotiana paniculata and N. rustica (Kölreuter [1761]). As a result from these crosses, he made important conclusions about plant hybridization. First, he observed that first generation (F1) hybrids usually exhibit pollen malfunction, describing them as ‘botanical mules’. Second, Kölreuter made an important observation regarding ecological factors in the formation of hybrid individuals. He noted that hybrids were likely to occur when two closely related allopatric species are brought into sympatry by means of anthropogenic disturbance; resulting in hybrids with morphological intermediacy. When the hybrids obtained by Kölreuter were backcrossed with the parental species, the phenotype of the latters was recovered. He considered that hybrid sterility and the reversion to the parental phenotypes were a mean by which the preexisting harmony of nature could be conserved, considering hybrids as ‘unnatural procreations’ (Kölreuter [1761]). Thus, he considered that hybridization was an ephemeral phenomenon with little importance, reinforcing the ideas of special creation of species prevailing at that time (Roberts [1929]). By this time, all hybridization experiments were conducted by hand pollination. However, Kölreuter also noted that insect pollination occurred in a number of plants including the genus Iris, Nicotiana, Oenothera among others. Later, Sprengel ([1793]) described in great detail insect pollination in plants. Also, Sprengel found that the maturation of stamens and pistils within a same flower could exhibit temporal isolation. With this evidence, he suggested that these were mechanisms that maximize cross fertilization in plants, also noting that hybridization between different species pair could occur through insect pollination. Sprengel’s work was influential to several authors such as Darwin ([1859]).\nAt the beginnings of nineteenth century, hybridization was largely used as a source of variation for plants of agronomical or ornamental importance. However, at this time...[Content truncated]",

Photo courtesy of Jianming Yu.\n\r\n\tAMES, Iowa – An Iowa State University agronomist has helped uncover the genetic mechanisms in sorghum plants that allow hybrids to perform better than parent varieties, a process known as heterosis.\n\r\n\tThe new study fills in some of the gaps that have nagged scientists for years and could lead to more precision in plant breeding, said Jianming Yu, an associate professor of agronomy and the Pioneer Distinguished Chair in Maize Breeding.\n\r\n\tThe precise genetics that that drive heterosis are only partially understood, so Yu worked with colleagues at Kansas State University to pin down how heterosis works regarding plant height in sorghum plants. The research was published recently in the peer-reviewed Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\r\n\t“The mechanisms behind heterosis have been debated for a long time, but there haven’t been a lot of concrete answers,” said Xin Li, the first author and a graduate student in agronomy. “For this paper, we tried to show specifically what is happening with plant height in sorghum. It’s an example that illustrates the theory.”\n\r\n\tThe study focused on repulsion phase linkage, or the link between a dominant allele of one gene with the recessive allele of another gene. The dominant alleles are responsible for the higher expression of hereditary traits. Studying repulsion phase linkage in sorghum explains how...[Content truncated]",

This review provides an overview of recent advances in understanding why plant polyploid species are so ubiquitous and diverse. We consider how the modern framework for understanding genetic mechanisms of speciation could be used to study allopolyploid speciation that occurs through hybrid genome doubling, that is, whole genome doubling of interspecific F1 hybrids by the union of male and female unreduced gametes. We outline genetic and ecological mechanisms that may have positive or negative impacts on the process of allopolyploid speciation through hybrid genome doubling. We also discuss the current status of studies on the underlying genetic mechanisms focusing on the wheat (Triticum and Aegilops) hybrid-specific reproductive phenomena that are well known but deserve renewed attention from an evolutionary viewpoint.\n**Keywords:** Allopolyploidization; Gametocidal genes; Hybrid dysgenesis; Kr genes; Polyploid genome alteration; Reproductive barriers; Uniparental chromosome elimination; Unreduced gamete production.\n© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

With the growing availability of genomic tools and advancements in genomic analyses, it is becoming increasingly clear that gene flow between divergent taxa can generate new phenotypic diversity, allow for adaptation to novel environments, and contribute to speciation. Hybridization can have immediate phenotypic consequences through the expression of hybrid vigor. On longer evolutionary time scales, hybridization can lead to local adaption through the introgression of novel alleles and transgressive segregation and, in some cases, result in the formation of new hybrid species. Studying both the abundance and the evolutionary consequences of hybridization has deep historical roots in plant biology. Many of the hypotheses concerning how and why hybridization contributes to biological diversity currently being investigated were first proposed tens and even hundreds of years ago. In this Update, we discuss how new advancements in genomic and genetic tools are revolutionizing our ability to document the occurrence of and investigate the outcomes of hybridization in plants.\nIn natural populations, hybridization can act in opposition to divergence, introduce adaptive variation into a population, drive the evolution of stronger reproductive barriers, or generate new lineages. Hybridization is purposefully employed in the breeding of domesticated plants to take advantage of transient hybrid vigor, move desirable variation among lineages, and generate novel phenotypes.

Introduction\n----------------\nHybrids offer significant advantages for enhancing the economic and technological aspects of vegetable cultivation, primarily due to the phenomenon of heterosis, which confers superiority over diverse parent varieties. Hybrids’ exploitation is of the utmost importance in addressing the emerging challenges induced by climate change, including the mitigation of food and nutritional insecurities. Moreover, hybrids provide a powerful tool for breeders to maximize the yield potential of vegetable crops. Heterosis exerts a profound impact on both productivity and quality across a range of vegetable crops, enabling improvements in livelihoods by enhancing productivity and delivering high-quality products and nutritionally superior food options. Leveraging genetic mechanisms to exploit heterosis facilitates enhancing productivity, improving quality (depending on the objective), and reducing seed production costs. The growing interest in heterosis exploitation and the utilization of genetic mechanisms is evident in the intensified investigation of self-incompatibility (SI), male sterility, and gynoecism and their applications in hybrid seed production for several vegetable crops. However, it is important to note that these mechanisms are limited to specific classes of vegetable crops.\nHeterosis (also known as hybrid vigor) plays a pivotal role in vegetable breeding, leading to significant improvements in yield, quality, and earliness, which are considered the desirable outcomes when genetically distant parents are used to produce hybrid off-springs in vegetable crops. However, the selection of suitable parents is crucial for achieving these results \\\\]. Genetic diversity among parents enables the development of inbred lines that exhibit both good general and specific combining abilities, which are then utilized to produce promising hybrids. The genetic system of the parents determines their combining ability and helps to predict selection efficiency. Combining ability analysis helps in understanding gene action and assists in selecting appropriate breeding procedures for quantitative trait improvement. The availability of a larger number of seeds per pollination/cross and the presence of genetic mechanisms such as male sterility (tomato, chili, capsicum, onion, and cole crops), gynoec...[Content truncated]",

Some plants will cross-pollinate and the resulting fertilized hybrid embryo develops but is unable to mature and sprout. Modern plant breeders work around this problem by pollinating naturally and then removing the plant embryo before it stops growing, placing it in a tissue-culture environment where it can complete its development. Such embryo rescue is not considered genetic engineering, and it is not commonly used to derive new varieties directly, but it is used instead as an intermediary step in transferring genes from distant, sexually incompatible relatives through intermediate, partially compatible relatives of both the donor and recipient species.\n#### Somatic Hybridization\nRecent advances in tissue-culture technologies have provided new opportunities for recombining genes from different plant sources. In _somatic hybridization,_ a process also known as _cell fusion,_ cells growing in a culture medium are stripped of their protective walls, usually using pectinase, cellulase, and hemicellulase enzymes. These stripped cells, called _protoplasts_, are pooled from different sources and, through the use of varied techniques such as electrical shock, are fused with one another.\nWhen two protoplasts fuse, the resulting somatic hybrid contains the genetic material from both plant sources. This method overcomes physical barriers to pollen-based hybridization, but not basic chromosomal incompatibilities. If the somatic hybrid is compatible and healthy, it may grow a new cell wall, begin mitotic divisions, and ultimately grow into a hybrid plant that carries genetic features of both parents. While protoplast fusions are easily accomplished, as almost all plants (and animals) have cells suitable for this process, relatively few are capable of regenerating a whole organism, and fewer still are capable of sexual reproduction. This non-genetic engineering technique is not common in plant breeding as the resulting range of successful, fertile hybrids has not extended much beyond what is possible using other conventional technologies.\n#### Somaclonal Variation\n is the name given to spontaneous mutations that occur when plant cells are grown in vitro. For many years plants regenerated from tis-sue culture sometimes had novel features. It was not until the 1980s that two Australian scientists thought this phenomenon might provide a new source of genetic variability, and that some of the variant plants might carry attributes of value to plant breeders (Larkin and Scowcroft, 1981).\nThrough the 1980s plant breeders around the world grew plants in vitro and scored regenerants for potentially valuable variants in a range of different crops. New varieties of several crops, such as flax, were developed and commercially released (Rowland et al., 2002). Molecular analyses of these new varieties were not required by regulators at that time, nor were they conducted by developers...[Content truncated]",

Photo by Nazmul Hossain, Iowa State University.\nAMES, Iowa – Growing populations and shrinking agricultural resources are among the most important challenges facing food production. To meet projected increases in global demand for food, feed and fiber, experts say progress is needed to accelerate genetic improvement of crops.\nThe USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture has awarded $649,443 for a three-year grant led by Siddique I. Aboobucker, research scientist in agronomy at Iowa State University, working with Thomas Lübberstedt, Frey Chair in Agronomy and director of the Raymond F. Baker Center for Plant Breeding. Their project will investigate genetic mechanisms that could be used to improve doubled haploid processes to create pure genetic lines for breeding corn and, eventually, other crops.\nUse of the DH method is one of the basic technologies underpinning modern corn breeding. It can speed up inbred line development by reducing the number of generations from seven in traditional breeding to two generations in DH breeding, according to Aboobucker.\nHowever, DH technology has significant challenges. It requires creation of haploid plants that carry only a single copy of the genome. Resulting haploid male flowers are usually sterile. Overcoming this problem has required exposing the seedlings to the toxic chemical colchicine in a labor-intensive and costly process that spurs genome doubling and returns fertility to haploid male flowers.\nIn , Aboobucker and colleagues demonstrated that exploiting mutations which modify the positioning of the spindle mechanism during the plant reproductive phase known as meiosis can restore male fertility of haploid plants. That study was conducted using the model research plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Aboobucker’s new project will build on this work by advancing identification and manipulation of genetic mutations that could more easily restore haploid male fertility in maize (corn) while avoiding the need for chemicals.\n“The genetic mechanisms I’m exploring have great potential to make the technology for inbred line creation in maize more efficient and more widely available,” Aboobucker said. “As the same genes are also conserved in a number of other plant species, the research opens the possibility to apply the results to other crops in the future.”",

People worldwide are more interested than ever in their food, its textures, nutritional quality, flavors, and medicinal applications, the stability and diversity of both supply and demand, and the impact of food production, consumption and distribution on human health and on the environment. Low-cost DNA and RNA sequencing methods, high throughput chemical analyses, remote sensing, gene editing, imaging, and robotics have increased the type and the volume of data that we can bring to bear on these questions. Computing and statistical methods have developed apace to bring it all together and enable us to make predictions about future varieties.\nCornell’s Field of Plant Breeding trains interdisciplinary scientists in the elaboration of new crop improvement breeding methods, the discovery of genetic mechanisms affecting economically important traits, and the creation of genetic stocks, germplasm, and crop varieties. We work across major crop categories such as cereals, forages, legumes, roots and tubers, diverse fruits and vegetables, cover crops, bioenergy crops, hemp, hops, and ornamental plants, seeking improvements in productivity, quality, disease resistance, abiotic stress tolerance, and ecosystem services. We apply techniques spanning classical field evaluations, often using remote sensing and robotics, to high-throughput “-omics” data generation to computational pipelines, modeling, and prediction in these efforts. We promote collaborative and interactive work to improve shared learning and mutual support between fundamental, basic, translational and applied researchers. We are active in our pursuit of diversity, equity, and inclusion in plant breeding and recognize both past failings in our discipline and opportunities to reckon with this past. We are world leaders in innovative plant breeding research, teaching, extension to stakeholders, and science communication. We collaborate globally.\nThe Field of Plant Breeding welcomes applicants from around the world who are eager to be leaders in discovery and innovation and who seek to develop solutions to pressing problems and grand global challenges. We provide training that links current science with well-defined problems and methods to tackle them. Our alumni work at the cutting...[Content truncated]",
