Not one of them is naturally occurring. They’re all hybrids.  Oranges are a hybrid of the pomelo and mandarin.  Lemons are a hybrid of bitter orange and citron. Limes are a strange bunch, and consist of many kinds of hybrids. Grapefruits are hybrids of a kind of sweet orange, which is also a hybrid, and pomelo. Natural citrus fruits include the mandarin, pomelo, papeda, and citron. They’ve all been used to create many kinds of hybrids.\n]\nThree citron varieties.\nOther citrus include, shekwasha (a type of mandarin), many varieties of Japanese mandarins which can be pure or hybrid, kumquats (which are natural), tangerines (which may be a hybrid or a type of mandarin), clementines (which are mandarin hybrids), and yuzu (which are mandarin/papeda hybrids).\n]\nLeft is yuzu (a hybrid of mandarin and papeda), right is a mandarin orange (not a hybrid).\nOf course, bananas that we see today are hybrids. They are infertile, so they need to be cultivated by humans.\nThe strawberries that we eat today are hybrids, and actually pretty recent.  Wild strawberries look a bit unusual.\n]\nWild strawberry.\nBlueberries are native to North America and grow in the wild.\nRaspberries are native to North America, Europe, and Asia, and grow in the wild.  But some are hybrids of a couple species.\nApples have many varieties, but the original comes from around central Asia.\nGrapes originated in Georgia (the country), and wine has been produced just as long as...[Content truncated]",

The pathogenic model in which antigens initiate and drive the process is currently under investigation \\, \\]. Other pathogenic organisms, such as rubella infection, enteroviruses, human cytomegalovirus, and rotavirus, have all been suggested to play a role in cross-reactivity leading to pancreatic islet cell destruction \\\\]. Cross-reactivity is thought to occur when antigens share amino acid sequence homology with self-tissue proteins in susceptible hosts and has been theorized as a trigger for tissue-specific autoimmune diseases \\–\\]. Immunological cross-reactivity was first identified in 1942 when it was found that individuals sensitized to pollen allergens developed immune reactivity to specific fruits \\\\]. Further study found that cross-reactivity with pollen could also occur to human tissue target proteins \\\\].\nDietary protein cross-reactivity research has received limited attention in type 1 diabetes. Current research has mostly been limited to gluten and milk proteins as potential sources of pancreatic islet cell destruction. Cow's milk albumin has also been suggested in the etiology of type 1 diabetes due to milk peptide antibody (bovine serum albumin antibodies) binding to beta-cell-specific surface protein and promoting islet cell destruction \\–\\]. Additionally, the prevalence of celiac disease in adult type 1 diabetic patients was found to be approximately 10.5% \\\\]. In one study, antibodies to the wheat storage globulin Glb1 were found in the serum of diabetic patients, but not in age-, sex-, nor HLA-DQ-matched controls. This provides a first candidate wheat protein that is not only antigenic in diabetic rats and human patients but also closely linked to autoimmune attack on the pancreas \\\\]. A review paper found that studies in animal models and infant exposure to gluten demonstrated diabetogenic potential of gluten exposure. Some studies now suggest a gluten-free diet that may preserve beta cell function \\\\].\nIt is possible that other food proteins play a role in pancreatic cell cross-reactivity leading to islet cell destruction. In this study, we evaluated the potential for dietary protein cross-reactivity with insulin and pancreatic target sites by evaluating immune reactivity between target-specific antibodies and purified dietary proteins shown in . We measured immune reactivity of either target-specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies for insulin, insulin receptor alpha (IR-A), insulin receptor beta (IR-B), zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8), islet antigen 2 (IA2), and glutamic...[Content truncated]",

The study also has unveiled two major evolutionary events that occurred millions of years ago in the kiwifruit genome.\n“The kiwifruit is an economically and nutritionally important fruit crop. It has long been called ‘the king of fruits’ because of its remarkably high vitamin C content and balanced nutritional composition of minerals, dietary fiber and other health-benefits,” says , a scientist from the Boyce Thompson Institute at Cornell who contributed heavily to study, which was conducted by a team of plant scientists from the United States and China and published Oct. 18 in Nature Communications.\n“The genome sequence will serve as a valuable resource for kiwifruit research and may facilitate the breeding program for improved fruit quality and disease resistance,” Fei says.\nKiwifruit originated from the mountains and ranges of southwestern China and was not really known to the world until the early 20th century, when farmers in New Zealand discovered the fruit and began breeding it as a commercial crop. It is a form of berry that grows on woody vines, much like grapes, and belongs to the order of Ericales, where blueberries, tea bushes and Brazil nuts are also classified.\nOne of the most remarkable findings of the study was uncovered when scientists observed a high percentage of similarities within the kiwifruit DNA. The data revealed two unusual mishaps that occurred in the process of cell division about 27 and 80 million years ago, when an extensive expansion of genes arose from an entire extra copy of the genome, followed by extensive gene loss.\nFei explains, “The kiwifruit genome has undergone two recent whole-genome duplication events.”\nWhen genes are duplicated, the extra genes can mutate to perform entirely new functions that were not previously present in the organism. This process, called neofunctionalization, can occur with no adverse effects in plants and, in the case of kiwifruit, was...[Content truncated]",

Fan Zhu, in , 2021\n### Abstract\nKiwifruit (_Actinidia_ spp.) is a commercially important fruit crop. Various species and cultivars, non-fruit plant parts, and agricultural and processing wastes are underutilized. A broad-scoped review of kiwifruit guides further innovative applications. Different kiwifruit varieties and edible and nonedible parts varied in the composition of dietary nutrients including polyphenols, vitamins, dietary fiber, and functional ingredients, such as starch and protease and bioactive phytochemicals. Kiwifruits exhibit antioxidative, antiproliferative, antiinflammatory, antimicrobial, antihypertensive, antihypercholesterolemic, neuroprotective, antiobese properties and promote gut health. Clinically significant effects of kiwifruit on prevention and/or treatment of major chronic diseases are not yet evident. Varieties and plant parts, extraction, analytical and processing methods affect the physicochemical and biological properties of kiwifruit-derived ingredients. Allergens, mycotoxins, pesticides and heavy metals are the chemical hazards of kiwifruits. Future research should be focused on sustainable uses of underutilized resources as functional ingredients, bioactive compound purification, composition-activity relationships, and physiological mechanisms and clinical significance of kiwifruits.\nURL:\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814620323311\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSergio Pérez-Burilo, ...

Researchers of the University of Leipzig and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, have now sequenced the genetic code of this endangered species and have identified several sequence changes that underlie the kiwi’s adaptation to a nocturnal lifestyle: They found several genes involved in colour vision to be inactivated and the diversity of odorant receptors to be higher than in other birds - suggesting an increased reliance on their sense of smell rather than vision for foraging. The study was published in the journal “Genome Biology”.\n!\n!\nLike all kiwi species, the Brown Kiwi (_Apteryx mantelli_) is adapted to living in darkness. The birds spend all day in a cave which they only leave at nightfall.

The birds spend all day in a cave which they only leave at nightfall. In their nocturnal forays, they rely on smells and sounds - an unusual behaviour for birds.\n© 123RF/Eric Isselee\nKiwi have a number of features that make them interesting for study: They only have rudimentary wings, no tail and a very long beak with nostrils. They are mainly nocturnal with a low basal metabolic rate and the lowest body temperature among birds. To date there has been little genetic information available for this species that might help scientists to understand their unusual biology better.\nAn international team led by Torsten Schöneberg of the Institute of Biochemistry of the Medical Faculty at the University of Leipzig and Janet Kelso of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology have now sequenced the genome of the brown kiwi (_Apteryx mantelli)_. Their analyses show genetic changes that likely reflect adaptation to nocturnal life. Although mutations have inactivated some of the key genes involved in colour vision, the number of odorant receptor genes is expanded suggesting that the . These changes happened about 35 million years ago which is after the kiwi’s arrival in New Zealand.\n“Already French botanist and zoologist Jean Baptiste de Lamarck, who lived in the 18th century, hypothesized that evolution...[Content truncated]",

The answer in every case above is no, but the truth is perhaps even stranger.\nRemarkably, the parentage of every single one of the apple varieties listed above is unknown. Red Delicious emerged by chance in an Iowa fence row. It was spotted in about 1870 and bulked up by the Stark Nursery Company. Golden Delicious (no relation except that it's an apple) emerged as a chance seedling, in about 1890, in a hedgerow in West Virginia. It gained a particular claim to fame by being cloned into millions of grafted young trees by the officers of the Marshall Plan, and exported, after 1945, to revive the fruit industry of Western Europe.\nIt seems that many of our favorite apples have arisen by sheer chance. So what is the arithmetic basis of this lottery? The secret to the apple's origin lies in the fact that apple trees cannot normally pollinate themselves. Unlike, say, peaches, which can and do self-pollinate, predictably producing peaches virtually identical to the parents, the viable seeds (or pips) will produce apples, some of which may have value—but none of which will resemble the parents. Imagine the evolutionary power of the multiplicity of potential crosses in planted or wild orchards. Then multiply this potential by the fact that a range of bee species may act as pollen vectors and that a female bee can forage for up to three kilometers.\nLittle wonder that there may be, throughout the temperate world, perhaps 20,000 distinct named apple varieties. There are, by contrast, only two varieties of commercial banana and just one of the kiwifruit. Moreover, with almost no exceptions, every single apple pip has the potential to grow into a new apple tree—there are virtually no sterile apples. Elite apples from this genetic kaleidoscope may be grafted to preserve their exact genetic character, but this is not essential. Apple trees on their own roots are perfectly viable. On the other hand, very many other commercial fruit crops, such as navel oranges and commercial bananas, are totally sterile and rely, eternally, for their genetic future and spread, on grafting or some other form of clonal propagation.\nLong ago, probably some time between the end of the Cretaceous and the early Tertiary period (about 65 to 50 million years ago), the ancestors of the apple migrated west across the land bridge connecting what is now North America with Asia.Although the Bering Strait...[Content truncated]",
