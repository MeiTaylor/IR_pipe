In this case, cross-pollination happened by accident\u2014but intentional cross-pollination is how horticulturalists develop hybrids like the plum-apricot combination called the pluot\u00a0(or plumcot, depending on ).\nThe second thing that\u2019s not totally crazy about this video is the idea of growing one plant out of another. Horticulturalists use a technique called grafting to splice together the stem from one species of plant to the rootstock of another. Comai says this is commonly done with fruit trees, noting that in Europe, many local species of grapes are grafted onto American grape rootstock that\u2019s more tolerant to an aphid-like bug called phylloxera. Grafting is also sometimes used to control the size of trees in orchards.\n!\nA field technician grafts multiple hybrid cultivars to a large avocado tree stump. After the successful grafts, the tree will yield avocados of multiple varieties over a long growing season.\nPhotograph by Design Pics Inc, Nat Geo Image Collection\n(Check out this artist\u2019s quest to .)\nWhile grafting certainly can\u2019t produce a baniwi, there is some evidence that this technique can generate hybridized cells at the interface between the two grafted plants. These cells can swap their nuclear genomes and mitochondria from one side of the graft to the other.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad that that banana with the beautiful green kiwi inside is not real, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Comai says. And he\u2019s not certain it ever will be\u2014kiwi and banana are just too different to hybridize. Until science manages to figure out how to make the two fruits one, though, there\u2019s always a little sleight of hand combined with Mahar\u2019s method: Cut a banana in half, scoop out some of its flesh, and smush some kiwi inside the bright yellow skin.\nVoila, a baniwi.\n__\u00a0_is a freelance science journalist whose work appears in National Geographic\u2019s The Plate,_ Slate_,_ Nature_,_ Hakai_, and others.

Hybrids use traditional pollination that can ordinarily occur in nature. With controlled pollination, cultivars can breed new generations of fruiting plants with increasingly desirable characteristics.\nFarmers benefit from hybridized fruit plants that are naturally disease resistant and hearty in heat, cold and drought \u2014 in addition to producing consistent, higher yields with...[Content truncated]",

How many of those will make it to your local or mail order nursery is all dependent upon what brokers and the big three invest in. Who are the big three? Lowe\u2019s, Wal-Mart and Home Depot. What you see available in the marketplace is partially determined by their buyers for the big three and their ongoing relationships with brands.\n!\n\u2018Bonfire\u2019 coleus in June. It\u2019s just getting started. I bought this one from Rosy Dawn Gardens last year.\nBrokers often represent smaller nurseries, and to tell the truth, many smaller operations are leery of investing in newer plant varieties. At the California Spring Trials (CAST), it was interesting to watch hybridizers, seed and plant companies explaining why their newest euphorbia was better than one like Diamond Frost**\u00ae**. That\u2019s only one example and not even a coleus. Many companies now put their best work under\u00a0trademarked series names like: Main Street\u2122 by D\u00fcmmen Orange, Under the Sea**\u00ae** by HortCouture and ColorBlaze**\u00ae** by Proven Winners, etc. Here are more of the . Think of these as book or movie\u00a0sequels like those created by Marvel Comics. Hybridizers\u00a0hope\u00a0you will remember the series name and keep coming back for more. Who can blame them? Gardeners clamor each year for new plants, and plant hybridizing in all of its various forms is an expensive business.\n!\nIt was great to see all the combinations at the California Spring Trials last year. This one of Coleus \u2018Lava Rose,\u2019 Euphorbia \u2018Breathless Blush\u2019 and EnduraScape\u2122 Hot Pink Verbena was especially pretty. Of course, keep in mind that this combo was grown\u00a0to perfection in a greenhouse and not yet exposed to outdoor conditions.\nSpeaking of new varieties to my garden, I ordered a few from  that I can\u2019t find anywhere else. I saw some of these last year when I was lucky enough to attend CAST in 2015\u00a0with the . If it\u2019s new and unique, Rosy Dawn will usually have it. However, their nursery is located in southeastern Michigan so their plants are usually way behind those I grow\u00a0in my\u00a0greenhouse. They\u2019re small so I put them in my greenhouse and grow them out a bit before I plant\u00a0them outside. They do have very nice root balls and acclimate very quickly. Rosy Dawn has old favorites and newer cultivars. I bought three plants...[Content truncated]",
