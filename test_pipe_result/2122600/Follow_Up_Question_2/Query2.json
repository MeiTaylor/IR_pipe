In this case, cross-pollination happened by accident—but intentional cross-pollination is how horticulturalists develop hybrids like the plum-apricot combination called the pluot (or plumcot, depending on ).\nThe second thing that’s not totally crazy about this video is the idea of growing one plant out of another. Horticulturalists use a technique called grafting to splice together the stem from one species of plant to the rootstock of another. Comai says this is commonly done with fruit trees, noting that in Europe, many local species of grapes are grafted onto American grape rootstock that’s more tolerant to an aphid-like bug called phylloxera. Grafting is also sometimes used to control the size of trees in orchards.\n!\nA field technician grafts multiple hybrid cultivars to a large avocado tree stump. After the successful grafts, the tree will yield avocados of multiple varieties over a long growing season.\nPhotograph by Design Pics Inc, Nat Geo Image Collection\n(Check out this artist’s quest to .)\nWhile grafting certainly can’t produce a baniwi, there is some evidence that this technique can generate hybridized cells at the interface between the two grafted plants. These cells can swap their nuclear genomes and mitochondria from one side of the graft to the other.\n“It’s too bad that that banana with the beautiful green kiwi inside is not real, isn’t it?” Comai says. And he’s not certain it ever will be—kiwi and banana are just too different to hybridize. Until science manages to figure out how to make the two fruits one, though, there’s always a little sleight of hand combined with Mahar’s method: Cut a banana in half, scoop out some of its flesh, and smush some kiwi inside the bright yellow skin.\nVoila, a baniwi.\n__ _is a freelance science journalist whose work appears in National Geographic’s The Plate,_ Slate_,_ Nature_,_ Hakai_, and others.

Hybrids use traditional pollination that can ordinarily occur in nature. With controlled pollination, cultivars can breed new generations of fruiting plants with increasingly desirable characteristics.\nFarmers benefit from hybridized fruit plants that are naturally disease resistant and hearty in heat, cold and drought — in addition to producing consistent, higher yields with...[Content truncated]",
