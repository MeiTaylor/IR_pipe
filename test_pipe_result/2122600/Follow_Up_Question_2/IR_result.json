These objectives continue to motivate modern breeders and food scientists, who have designed newer genetic modification methods for identifying, selecting, and analyzing individual organisms that possess genetically enhanced features.\nFor plant species, it can take up to 12 years to develop, evaluate, and release a new variety of crop in accordance with international requirements, which specify that any new variety must meet at least three criteria: it must be genetically distinct from all other varieties, it must be genetically uniform through the population, and it must be genetically stable (UPOV, 2002).\nWhile advances in modification methods hold the potential for reducing the time it takes to bring new foods to the marketplace, an important benefit of a long evaluation period is that it provides opportunities for greater assurance that deleterious features will be identified and potentially harmful new varieties can be eliminated before commercial release. As discussed more fully in , it is both prudent and preferable to identify potentially hazardous products before they are made commercially available, and with few exceptions standard plant breeding practices have been very successful in doing so.\nPLANT GENETIC MODIFICATION\n--------------------------\n### Techniques Other than Genetic Engineering\n#### Simple Selection\nThe easiest method of plant genetic modification (see Operational Definitions in ), used by our nomadic ancestors and continuing today, is simple selection. That is, a genetically heterogeneous population of plants is inspected, and “superior” individuals—plants with the most desired traits, such as improved palatability and yield—are selected for continued propagation. The others are eaten or discarded. The seeds from the superior plants are sown to produce a new generation of plants, all or most of which will carry and express the desired traits. Over a period of several years, these plants or their seeds are saved and replanted, which increases the population of superior plants and shifts the genetic population so that it is dominated by the superior genotype. This very old method of breeding has been enhanced with modern technology.\nAn example of modern methods of simple selection is _marker-assisted selection,_ which uses molecular analysis to detect plants likely to express desired features, such as disease resistance to one or more specific pathogens in a population. Successfully applying marker-assisted selection allows a faster, more efficient mechanism for identifying candidate individuals that may have “superior traits.”\nSuperior traits are those considered beneficial to humans, as well as to domesticated animals that consume a plant-based diet; they are not necessarily beneficial to the plant in an ecological or evolutionary context. Often traits considered beneficial to breed...[Content truncated]",

In this case, cross-pollination happened by accident—but intentional cross-pollination is how horticulturalists develop hybrids like the plum-apricot combination called the pluot (or plumcot, depending on ).\nThe second thing that’s not totally crazy about this video is the idea of growing one plant out of another. Horticulturalists use a technique called grafting to splice together the stem from one species of plant to the rootstock of another. Comai says this is commonly done with fruit trees, noting that in Europe, many local species of grapes are grafted onto American grape rootstock that’s more tolerant to an aphid-like bug called phylloxera. Grafting is also sometimes used to control the size of trees in orchards.\n!\nA field technician grafts multiple hybrid cultivars to a large avocado tree stump.

These cells can swap their nuclear genomes and mitochondria from one side of the graft to the other.\n“It’s too bad that that banana with the beautiful green kiwi inside is not real, isn’t it?” Comai says. And he’s not certain it ever will be—kiwi and banana are just too different to hybridize. Until science manages to figure out how to make the two fruits one, though, there’s always a little sleight of hand combined with Mahar’s method: Cut a banana in half, scoop out some of its flesh, and smush some kiwi inside the bright yellow skin.\nVoila, a baniwi.\n__ _is a freelance science journalist whose work appears in National Geographic’s The Plate,_ Slate_,_ Nature_,_ Hakai_, and others.

After scientists developed genetic engineering in the 1970s, they were able to make similar changes in a more specific way and in a shorter amount of time.\nA Timeline of Genetic Modification in Agriculture\n-------------------------------------------------\n**A Timeline of Genetic Modification in Modern Agriculture**\n!\n in Modern Agriculture (Infographic) \")\n**Circa 8000 BCE:** Humans use traditional modification methods like selective breeding and cross-breeding to breed plants and animals with more desirable traits.\n**1866:** Gregor Mendel, an Austrian monk, breeds two different types of peas and identifies the basic process of genetics.\n**1922:** The first hybrid corn is produced and sold commercially.\n**1940:** Plant breeders learn to use radiation or chemicals to randomly change an organism’s DNA.\n**1953:** Building on the discoveries of chemist Rosalind Franklin, scientists James Watson and Francis Crick identify the structure of DNA.\n**1973:** Biochemists Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen develop genetic engineering by inserting DNA from one bacteria into another.\n**1982:** FDA approves the first consumer GMO product developed through genetic engineering: human insulin to treat diabetes.\n**...[Content truncated]"

In this case, cross-pollination happened by accident—but intentional cross-pollination is how horticulturalists develop hybrids like the plum-apricot combination called the pluot (or plumcot, depending on ).\nThe second thing that’s not totally crazy about this video is the idea of growing one plant out of another. Horticulturalists use a technique called grafting to splice together the stem from one species of plant to the rootstock of another. Comai says this is commonly done with fruit trees, noting that in Europe, many local species of grapes are grafted onto American grape rootstock that’s more tolerant to an aphid-like bug called phylloxera. Grafting is also sometimes used to control the size of trees in orchards.\n!\nA field technician grafts multiple hybrid cultivars to a large avocado tree stump.

These cells can swap their nuclear genomes and mitochondria from one side of the graft to the other.\n“It’s too bad that that banana with the beautiful green kiwi inside is not real, isn’t it?” Comai says. And he’s not certain it ever will be—kiwi and banana are just too different to hybridize. Until science manages to figure out how to make the two fruits one, though, there’s always a little sleight of hand combined with Mahar’s method: Cut a banana in half, scoop out some of its flesh, and smush some kiwi inside the bright yellow skin.\nVoila, a baniwi.\n__ _is a freelance science journalist whose work appears in National Geographic’s The Plate,_ Slate_,_ Nature_,_ Hakai_, and others.

These objectives continue to motivate modern breeders and food scientists, who have designed newer genetic modification methods for identifying, selecting, and analyzing individual organisms that possess genetically enhanced features.\nFor plant species, it can take up to 12 years to develop, evaluate, and release a new variety of crop in accordance with international requirements, which specify that any new variety must meet at least three criteria: it must be genetically distinct from all other varieties, it must be genetically uniform through the population, and it must be genetically stable (UPOV, 2002).\nWhile advances in modification methods hold the potential for reducing the time it takes to bring new foods to the marketplace, an important benefit of a long evaluation period is that it provides opportunities for greater assurance that deleterious features will be identified and potentially harmful new varieties can be eliminated before commercial release. As discussed more fully in , it is both prudent and preferable to identify potentially hazardous products before they are made commercially available, and with few exceptions standard plant breeding practices have been very successful in doing so.\nPLANT GENETIC MODIFICATION\n--------------------------\n### Techniques Other than Genetic Engineering\n#### Simple Selection\nThe easiest method of plant genetic modification (see Operational Definitions in ), used by our nomadic ancestors and continuing today, is simple selection. That is, a genetically heterogeneous population of plants is inspected, and “superior” individuals—plants with the most desired traits, such as improved palatability and yield—are selected for continued propagation. The others are eaten or discarded. The seeds from the superior plants are sown to produce a new generation of plants, all or most of which will carry and express the desired traits. Over a period of several years, these plants or their seeds are saved and replanted, which increases the population of superior plants and shifts the genetic population so that it is dominated by the superior genotype. This very old method of breeding has been enhanced with modern technology.\nAn example of modern methods of simple selection is _marker-assisted selection,_ which uses molecular analysis to detect plants likely to express desired features, such as disease resistance to one or more specific pathogens in a population. Successfully applying marker-assisted selection allows a faster, more efficient mechanism for identifying candidate individuals that may have “superior traits.”\nSuperior traits are those considered beneficial to humans, as well as to domesticated animals that consume a plant-based diet; they are not necessarily beneficial to the plant in an ecological or evolutionary context. Often traits considered beneficial to breed...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What alternative methods exist for creating hybrids in plants, and why are they not applicable to banana and kiwi?",
        "Answer": "Creating hybrids in plants can be achieved through several established methods, including traditional breeding, grafting, and modern genetic engineering techniques. However, these methods are not applicable to producing a hybrid between banana (Musa spp.) and kiwi (Actinidia spp.) due to significant biological and genetic incompatibilities between the two species.\n\n1. **Traditional Breeding**: Traditional breeding methods, such as cross-pollination, involve the careful selection of genetically compatible parent plants, where their gametes (pollen and ovules) combine to form viable offspring. For hybridization to be successful, the plants must have similar chromosome numbers and compatible reproductive mechanisms. Bananas and kiwis belong to different families and have differing chromosome structures, making traditional breeding ineffective for creating hybrids between them.\n\n2. **Grafting**: Grafting is a technique where the stem of one plant is spliced onto the rootstock of another. This method can allow for certain plant parts to exchange genetic material at the graft interface, but it does not create a true hybrid. While it is commonly used in fruits trees and can produce beneficial traits, grafting between banana and kiwi is not feasible because of their considerable genetic and structural differences that prevent successful union and growth.\n\n3. **Genetic Engineering**: Modern genetic engineering techniques can facilitate the transfer of specific genes between organisms, potentially creating hybrids that showcase desirable traits. However, for banana and kiwi, which are evolutionarily distinct, significant genomic barriers exist. The compatibility required for gene transfer and subsequent expression of hybrid traits is lacking between these two species.\n\nIn summary, while traditional breeding, grafting, and genetic engineering are viable methods for creating hybrids in plants, they are not applicable to banana and kiwi due to their genetic incompatibilities and biological differences. These challenges make hybridization between these two species not only complex but currently unattainable.",
