These objectives continue to motivate modern breeders and food scientists, who have designed newer genetic modification methods for identifying, selecting, and analyzing individual organisms that possess genetically enhanced features.\nFor plant species, it can take up to 12 years to develop, evaluate, and release a new variety of crop in accordance with international requirements, which specify that any new variety must meet at least three criteria: it must be genetically distinct from all other varieties, it must be genetically uniform through the population, and it must be genetically stable (UPOV, 2002).\nWhile advances in modification methods hold the potential for reducing the time it takes to bring new foods to the marketplace, an important benefit of a long evaluation period is that it provides opportunities for greater assurance that deleterious features will be identified and potentially harmful new varieties can be eliminated before commercial release. As discussed more fully in , it is both prudent and preferable to identify potentially hazardous products before they are made commercially available, and with few exceptions standard plant breeding practices have been very successful in doing so.\nPLANT GENETIC MODIFICATION\n--------------------------\n### Techniques Other than Genetic Engineering\n#### Simple Selection\nThe easiest method of plant genetic modification (see Operational Definitions in ), used by our nomadic ancestors and continuing today, is simple selection. That is, a genetically heterogeneous population of plants is inspected, and âsuperiorâ individualsâplants with the most desired traits, such as improved palatability and yieldâare selected for continued propagation. The others are eaten or discarded. The seeds from the superior plants are sown to produce a new generation of plants, all or most of which will carry and express the desired traits. Over a period of several years, these plants or their seeds are saved and replanted, which increases the population of superior plants and shifts the genetic population so that it is dominated by the superior genotype. This very old method of breeding has been enhanced with modern technology.\nAn example of modern methods of simple selection is _marker-assisted selection,_ which uses molecular analysis to detect plants likely to express desired features, such as disease resistance to one or more specific pathogens in a population. Successfully applying marker-assisted selection allows a faster, more efficient mechanism for identifying candidate individuals that may have âsuperior traits.â\nSuperior traits are those considered beneficial to humans, as well as to domesticated animals that consume a plant-based diet; they are not necessarily beneficial to the plant in an ecological or evolutionary context. Often traits considered beneficial to breed...[Content truncated]",

For example, early farmers developed cross-breeding methods to grow corn with a range of colors, sizes, and uses. Todayâs strawberries are a cross between a strawberry species native to North America and a strawberry species native to South America.\nMost of the foods we eat today were created through traditional breeding methods. But changing plants and animals through traditional breeding can take a long time, and it is difficult to make very specific changes. After scientists developed genetic engineering in the 1970s, they were able to make similar changes in a more specific way and in a shorter amount of time.\nA Timeline of Genetic Modification in Agriculture\n-------------------------------------------------\n**A Timeline of Genetic Modification in Modern Agriculture**\n!\n in Modern Agriculture (Infographic) \")\n**Circa 8000 BCE:** Humans use traditional modification methods like selective breeding and cross-breeding to breed plants and animals with more desirable traits.\n**1866:** Gregor Mendel, an Austrian monk, breeds two different types of peas and identifies the basic process of genetics.\n**1922:** The first hybrid corn is produced and sold commercially.\n**1940:** Plant breeders learn to use radiation or chemicals to randomly change an organismâs DNA.\n**1953:** Building on the discoveries of chemist Rosalind Franklin, scientists James Watson and Francis Crick identify the structure of DNA.\n**1973:** Biochemists Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen develop genetic engineering by inserting DNA from one bacteria into another.\n**1982:** FDA approves the first consumer GMO product developed through genetic engineering: human insulin to treat diabetes.\n**...[Content truncated]",

The Area Under the Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC) is one of the commonly metric used as a standard methodology to score FHB.

Here, we show that there are more efficient alternatives to AUDPC (angle, growing degree days to reach 50% FHB severity, and FHB maximum variance) that reduce the number of field assessments required and allow for fair comparisons between unbalanced evaluations across trials. Furthermore, we found that the evaluation method that captures the maximum variance in FHB severity across plots is the most optimal approach for scoring FHB. ",

Furthermore, we found that the evaluation method that captures the maximum variance in FHB severity across plots is the most optimal approach for scoring FHB. In addition, results obtained on experimental data were validated on a simulated experiment where the disease progress curve was modeled as a sigmoid curve with known parameters and assessment protocols were fully controlled. Results show that alternative metrics tested in this study captured key components of quantitative plant resistance. Moreover, the new metrics could be a starting point for more accurate methods for measuring FHB in the field. For example, the optimal interval for FHB evaluation could be predicted using prior knowledge from historical weather data and FHB scores from previous trials. Finally, the evaluation methods presented in this study can reduce the FHB phenotyping burden in plant breeding with minimal losses on signal detection, resulting in a response variable available to use in data-driven analysis such as genome-wide association studies or genomic selection.\nFusarium head blight (FHB), sometimes known as scab, is a global problem causing a great economic burden on the cereal industry due to its significant reductions in grain yield and quality Bottalico and Perrone (2002); Nganje etÂ al. (2004); McMullen etÂ al. (2012); Savary etÂ al. (2019). Many Fusarium species are considered phytopathogenic fungi, but in bread and durum wheat the most serious FHB-causing agent is Fusarium graminearum Schwabe [telomorph: Gibberella zeae Schw. (Petch)]. Upon infection, several Fusarium species produce aggressive secondary metabolites, which lead to crop contamination such as, deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, T2 toxin, fumonisin, and mycoestrogen zearalenone, which have negative effects on human diet and on animal growth and fertility Placinta etÂ al.

The vast diversity of breeding methods can be simplified into three categories: (i) plant breeding based on observed variation by selection of plants based on natural variants appearing in nature or within traditional varieties; (ii) plant breeding based on controlled mating by selection of plants presenting recombination of desirable genes from different parents; and (iii) plant breeding based on monitored recombination by selection of specific genes or marker profiles, using molecular tools for tracking within-genome variation. The continuous application of traditional breeding methods in a given species could lead to the narrowing of the gene pool from which cultivars are drawn, rendering crops vulnerable to biotic and abiotic stresses and hampering future progress.

                    "content": "All-electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) typically produce lower tailpipe emissions than conventional vehicles do, and zero tailpipe emissions when running only on electricity. Tailpipe emissions are only one factor in considering a vehicle's life cycle emissions; gasoline and electricity  also have upstream emissions to consider, which include extracting, refining, producing, and transporting the fuel. Estimating  emissions must account for both fuel-cycle emissions (also known as \"well to wheels\") and vehicle-cycle emissions (material and vehicle production as well as end of life). The combined emissions from vehicle and fuel production through vehicle decommissioning (i.e., recycling or scrapping) are referred to as life cycle or cradle-to-grave emissions.\nElectricity Sources and Fuel-Cycle Emissions\n--------------------------------------------\nAll-electric vehicles and PHEVs running only on electricity have zero tailpipe emissions, but electricity production, such as power plants, may generate emissions. In geographic areas that use relatively low-polluting energy sources for electricity generation, all-electric vehicles and PHEVs typically have an especially large life cycle emissions advantage over similar conventional vehicles running on gasoline or diesel. In areas with higher-emissions electricity, all-electric vehicles and PHEVs may not demonstrate as strong a life cycle emissions benefit.\nDirect, Well-to-Wheel, and Cradle-to-Grave Emissions\n----------------------------------------------------\nVehicle emissions can be divided into two general categories: air pollutants, which contribute to smog, haze, and health problems; and greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon dioxide and methane. Both categories of emissions can be evaluated on a tailpipe basis, a well-to-wheel basis, and a cradle-to-grave basis.\nConventional vehicles with an internal combustion engine (ICE) produce direct emissions through the tailpipe, as well as through evaporation from the vehicle's fuel system and during the fueling process. Conversely, all-electric vehicles produce zero direct emissions. PHEVs produce zero direct emissions when they are in all-electric mode, but they can produce evaporative emissions. When using the ICE, PHEVs produce tailpipe emissions...[Content truncated]",

However, the variability that exists within species populations is inadequate, hence the need to exploit desirable traits of interest in distantly related or even unrelated plants through hybridization techniques. Hybridization can be categorized into two; sexual and somatic. Sexual hybridization, also referred to as wide or distant hybridization involves combining two genomes from different parental taxa through pollination, either naturally or by induction. Somatic hybridization involves the fusion of somatic cells instead of gametes, which highly depends on the ability to obtain viable protoplasts and eventually differentiate them to whole plants in vitro. The impacts of hybrids can either be positive or negative. Among the positive attributes of hybrids that have been exploited is heterosis, which results either from dominance, over-dominance or epistasis. Negative ones include sterility, arrested growth of the pollen tube and embryo abortion. To overcome these problems, chromosome doubling, the use of hormones such as 2, 4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4-D) and embryo rescue have been employed to overcome sterility, arrested growth of pollen tubes and embryo abortion respectively. After the development of hybrids, different hybrid identification techniques have been used to test them such as the use of molecular and morphological markers, cytogenetic analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridization. The use of hybridization techniques in plant improvement remains a vital tool to cross species barriers and utilization of important attributes in unrelated crop plants which could not have been achieved through conventional techniques of plant breeding.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKeywords:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHybridization, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\treproductive barriers, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmolecular markers\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nÂ© Copyright 2010-Till Date, Asian Journal of Research in Crop Science.
