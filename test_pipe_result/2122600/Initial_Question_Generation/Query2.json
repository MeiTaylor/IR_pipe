If you take a close look at the end product, it's clearly not real. It even has a stem to connect it to other bananas — just like bananas that grow on the tree. It's simply illogical, but people are sharing this video with comments like \"gotta try this.\"\nIf you watched to the end of the video, you'll...[Content truncated]",

The video is of some stems growing out of the pot he planted the hybrid on. It then transforms into what looks like a banana with some stems growing in the top of it. He then proceeds to take out the hybrid from the pot and cuts a slice, revealing the final product.\nThe clip cuts abruptly at the end, and it’s because it’s not the full video. It is cut up and edited in a way that makes it seem real. The original video was posted on the YouTube channel “Kin community” on April 1st, 2014. The first clue pointing to this video not authentic is the date it was published (April Fools). If you watch the full video, you can see at the end the creator wishing everyone a happy April Fool’s Day. Then if you proceed to read the description of the video, everything is explained. Quoting the creator, “if you are able to successfully grow the beautiful banana and kiwi combination demonstrated in this video, we recommend you proceed directly to your corner market and purchase a lottery ticket.” This means that if you do get these results, then you better try your luck next with the lottery!\nThe original video has one million views. If you compare the views from the original video to the one posted on Facebook, you can see the effects of social media sharing. Facebook is available everywhere, and anyone can access it and post anything they want. This site is often used as a credible source on arguments and the spreading of news. The thing is, everyone is so ready to share everything that they don’t stop to check if they’re real.

It is actually the edible berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia. The most common commercialized variety is the fuzzy kiwifruit, Actinidia deliciosa. Kiwifruit is native to China but is also grown in various other countries, such as New Zealand, Italy, and Chile. It is a popular fruit known for its bright green flesh and sweet-tart flavor, as well as being a good source of vitamin C, vitamin K, and dietary fiber.\nUpvote ·\n]\nFormer Truck Driver Storeman at Economech Services (1990–2020) · Author has 487 answers and 129.6K answer views\n · \nNo and certainly genetically modified, if you used a little logic you would understand that N.Z. needs the image of PURE and Quality to ALL of their products.

Enterprising growers breed mash-ups—both deliberately and accidentally—to create new, and often entertainingly named  that highlight the best parts of each, while making a splash of their own.\nMost of these  are real, but one is a fake. Try to spot it.\nPeacherine\n----------\nThis peach-nectarine hybrid minimizes the outer fuzz of the former while maintaining its incomparable sweet, bursting flavor. Century-plus old volumes of the American Pomological Society records credit J. W. Philippi for at least one new kind of grape, and a 1908 letter to the editor from him in the _Pacific Rural Press_ expresses strong views on his potato hybridizing practices, but the peacherine may be Philippi's most delicious legacy.\nPlumcot\n-------\nBefore there were pluots—which are primarily plum—there were plumcots. In the late 19th century, a plant breeder named Luther Burbank developed this apricot-plum hybrid that's an equal, even mix of the two. They aren't especially easy to grow, and don't take well to harvesting and shipping, so a few enterprising breeders began crossing plumcots with plums to devise a more desirable mix for market. The flip side—with more apricot and a fuzzier skin—is called an aprium.\nTangelo\n-------\nCross a tangerine with a pomelo or a grapefruit, and boop—you've got a tangelo. This distinctive-looking fruit has a rather pronounced nipple at one end, is extremely juicy with a sweet start and a tart finish, and is bred to be easy to peel. Walter Tennyson Swingle is credited with introducing the earliest tangelo hybrid in 1897 and went on to perfect them throughout his career. See a Minneola or Honeybell on the shelves? You've got him to thank.\nBakiwi\n------\nBananas and kiwis are an irrefutably excellent flavor combo, so it was just a matter of time before someone thought to mash them up.

Becker\nApril 1, 2016\n•4 min read\nIn a video that went viral last week, a bearded, plaid-wearing man named  earnestly describes how to make a banana-kiwi hybrid (baniwi? kiwana?) by squishing together chunks of the two fruits, burying them in soil, watering them, and waiting. When this hybrid matures, he says in a voiceover, it grows into a fruit with the shape and skin of a banana and the bright-green flesh of a kiwi.\nSo is this subterranean, fruity embrace really how hybrids like pluots or tangelos are actually made?\nNo. It’s really, really not.\nMahar—who makes video tutorials for do-it-yourself crafts—originally posted his faux banana-kiwi hybridization lesson as part of a  on April 1, 2014. If the date he published the video on YouTube wasn’t enough of a clue, he wished viewers a happy April Fools’ Day at the end and suggested in its description that whoever managed to get this technique to work should go buy a lottery ticket.\nBut then earlier this month, a truncated banana-kiwi clip  by the Facebook group  (which Mahar says he has no affiliation with) and has since been viewed more than 69 million times. The truncated tutorial was convincing enough that , which Mahar says he was tickled to see.\n“To have them take the time to write an article about something so, in my mind, clearly ridiculous, is incredibly amusing,” he says.

But is it true?\nWe consulted with a horticulturist to find out how this works, and why no one had thought of it before. Bernie Hughson, horticulturist with the Arkansas Horticulture Institute, was amazed when he first viewed the video. “I couldn’t believe my eyes, really.” He said he’s never seen anything like it.\n!\n_The courtship._\nThe video shows a man slicing a banana, and then slicing a kiwi. He purposefully slices the end of the fruit off, instead of slicing them in the middle.\n“That’s how grafting works,” Hughson explained. “You take one piece of a plant and you insert one into the other or kind of push them together, and then a process starts that results in a change in the genetic makeup of the plant. You’ve basically created a chimera.”\nIn the video, the man then puts the two pieces of fruit flesh together, seeds touching. That way, the seeds can gently rub one another and stimulate the reproductive process. “That’s pretty important,” Hughson explains. “They have to be touching or else it won’t work. Chimeras aren’t created via some kind of airborne reproduction process.”\nOnce the two pieces of fruit are touching one another, they have to be placed in soil. They should be covered so the reproductive process can continue undisturbed. “I think one inch of soil is fine,” Hughson said in agreement with the video.\n!\n_This image shows the fruits mixing under the soil. The yellow color is banana, and the green is kiwi._\nUnder cover, on a soft bed of fluffy soil, the magic begins to happen. The banana and the kiwi are touching each other, and slowly begin to enter one another. The banana usually hardens up a bit, and the kiwi releases juices that surround the banana. Soon, a softening process begins. The process is quite beautiful to watch, according to Hughson. “It’s a magical thing.”\nAfter a few weeks, according to the video, your fruit will be ready to harvest. “This is true,” Hughson confirmed. “The process takes just a few weeks, and before you know it, you have a hybrid!”\n!\n_A banana kiwi hybrid fruit.

All the articles agree that the kiwi-banana is indeed a false claim. Snopes even points out that this particular Facebook video is a small snippet taken from a longer video that was shared to Facebook on April 1st, 2014. The original video posted in 2014 was posted as an April Fool’s joke; the individual that posted it even pointed out that the kiwi-banana was indeed a joke.\nThere is a article on National Geographic’s website that goes over how it is impossible to be able to squish two fruit to grow a hybrid. National Geographic points out that both bananas and kiwis are already hybrid fruit themselves. They became hybrids because in nature the pollen from one fruit would land onto another resulting in a interspecies hybrid. Hybrid fruits are possible as results of cross pollination, not by squishing two different fruits together and putting them in potting soil.\nConclusion\nWhile social media is without doubt a valuable tool to many people’s lives. Social media platforms have helped friends and family stay connected and has allowed for individuals to be able to share their thoughts and ideas. However, it has become a widely used source for fake news and rumors. Individuals using social media rarely question the validity of articles that show up on their news feeds. It does not take much to fact check the articles that are widely shared around social media; but the reality of it is, most share an article just by the headline without even clicking onto the full article.\nWorks Cited\nBecker, Rachel A. “Why This April Fools’ Kiwi Hybrid Is Bananas.” Culture, National Geographic, 10 Feb. 2021, www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/april-fools-kiwi-banana-hybrid-video.\nEvon, Dan. “FACT CHECK: How to Create a Hybrid Kiwi-Banana Fruit.” Snopes.com, 14 Aug. 2018, www.snopes.com/fact-check/banana-kiwi-hoax-video/.\n--\n--\nHelp\nStatus\nAbout\nCareers\nPress\nBlog\nPrivacy\nTerms\nText to speech\nTeams",
