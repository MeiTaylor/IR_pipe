Becker\nApril 1, 2016\n•4 min read\nIn a video that went viral last week, a bearded, plaid-wearing man named  earnestly describes how to make a banana-kiwi hybrid (baniwi? kiwana?) by squishing together chunks of the two fruits, burying them in soil, watering them, and waiting. When this hybrid matures, he says in a voiceover, it grows into a fruit with the shape and skin of a banana and the bright-green flesh of a kiwi.\nSo is this subterranean, fruity embrace really how hybrids like pluots or tangelos are actually made?\nNo. It’s really, really not.\nMahar—who makes video tutorials for do-it-yourself crafts—originally posted his faux banana-kiwi hybridization lesson as part of a  on April 1, 2014. If the date he published the video on YouTube wasn’t enough of a clue, he wished viewers a happy April Fools’ Day at the end and suggested in its description that whoever managed to get this technique to work should go buy a lottery ticket.\nBut then earlier this month, a truncated banana-kiwi clip  by the Facebook group  (which Mahar says he has no affiliation with) and has since been viewed more than 69 million times. The truncated tutorial was convincing enough that , which Mahar says he was tickled to see.\n“To have them take the time to write an article about something so, in my mind, clearly ridiculous, is incredibly amusing,” he says. He describes fighting hard to maintain his deadpan as the camera crew cracked up during filming.\nBut while it’s impossible to smush together two fruits to grow a hybrid, there is a seed of truth in this video, says , a plant geneticist at the University of California, Davis.\nFor one thing, the kiwis and bananas we eat are each hybrids themselves. Many of the bananas we find in the stores have three sets of chromosomes from two different ancestral species of banana. And the kiwifruit we eat are also polyploid, meaning they have more than two sets of chromosomes that probably accumulated during prehistoric times, when pollen from one species of kiwifruit was...[Content truncated]",

The answer in every case above is no, but the truth is perhaps even stranger.\nRemarkably, the parentage of every single one of the apple varieties listed above is unknown. Red Delicious emerged by chance in an Iowa fence row. It was spotted in about 1870 and bulked up by the Stark Nursery Company. Golden Delicious (no relation except that it's an apple) emerged as a chance seedling, in about 1890, in a hedgerow in West Virginia. It gained a particular claim to fame by being cloned into millions of grafted young trees by the officers of the Marshall Plan, and exported, after 1945, to revive the fruit industry of Western Europe.\nIt seems that many of our favorite apples have arisen by sheer chance. So what is the arithmetic basis of this lottery? The secret to the apple's origin lies in the fact that apple trees cannot normally pollinate themselves. Unlike, say, peaches, which can and do self-pollinate, predictably producing peaches virtually identical to the parents, the viable seeds (or pips) will produce apples, some of which may have value—but none of which will resemble the parents. Imagine the evolutionary power of the multiplicity of potential crosses in planted or wild orchards. Then multiply this potential by the fact that a range of bee species may act as pollen vectors and that a female bee can forage for up to three kilometers.\nLittle wonder that there may be, throughout the temperate world, perhaps 20,000 distinct named apple varieties. There are, by contrast, only two varieties of commercial banana and just one of the kiwifruit. Moreover, with almost no exceptions, every single apple pip has the potential to grow into a new apple tree—there are virtually no sterile apples. Elite apples from this genetic kaleidoscope may be grafted to preserve their exact genetic character, but this is not essential. Apple trees on their own roots are perfectly viable. On the other hand, very many other commercial fruit crops, such as navel oranges and commercial bananas, are totally sterile and rely, eternally, for their genetic future and spread, on grafting or some other form of clonal propagation.\nLong ago, probably some time between the end of the Cretaceous and the early Tertiary period (about 65 to 50 million years ago), the ancestors of the apple migrated west across the land bridge connecting what is now North America with Asia.Although the Bering Strait...[Content truncated]",

In its usual presentation, it is humorously foolish, so much so that Comfort has since taken to using it as a joke himself (and claiming that it always had been a joke or \"stand up routine\"), in contrast with the quite serious tactic he originally intended it as."

This is incredibly common for most, if not all, fruits, vegetables, and even animals that we use for food or to improve their utility to us in terms of ease of cultivation or taste. The banana was first domesticated around 8,000-9,000 years ago, somewhere in South and/or Southeast Asia, probably in today's Papua New Guinea] (which, following Comfort's logic, means that it was intelligently designed by some god worshiped there rather than by the Abrahamic God).] To say that bananas are _naturally_ designed to be the perfect food for humans is, at best, .\n]\nWild bananas look like this and you can't eat the seeds.

It is only through human cultivation that it has managed to survive this long despite a complete lack of natural, sexual propagation.

Newly described influences of dietary factors on neuronal function and synaptic plasticity have revealed some of the vital mechanisms that are responsible for the action of diet on brain health and mental function. Several gut hormones that can enter the brain, or that are produced in the brain itself, influence cognitive ability. In addition, well-established regulators of synaptic plasticity, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, can function as metabolic modulators, responding to peripheral signals such as food intake. Understanding the molecular basis of the effects of food on cognition will help us to determine how best to manipulate diet in order to increase the resistance of neurons to insults and promote mental fitness.\nAlthough food has classically been perceived as a means to provide energy and building material to the body, its ability to prevent and protect against diseases is starting to be recognized. In particular, research over the past 5 years has provided exciting evidence for the influence of dietary factors on specific molecular systems and mechanisms that maintain mental function. For instance, a diet that is rich in omega-3 fatty acids is garnering appreciation for supporting cognitive processes in humans1 and upregulating genes that are important for maintaining synaptic function and plasticity in rodents2. In turn, diets that are high in saturated fat are becoming notorious for reducing molecular substrates that support cognitive processing and increasing the risk of neurological dysfunction in both humans3 and animals4. Although these studies emphasize an important effect of food on the brain, further work is necessary to determine the mechanisms of action and the conditions for therapeutic applications in humans.\nOver thousands of years, diet, in conjunction with other aspects of daily living, such as exercise, has had a crucial role in shaping cognitive capacity and brain evolution (BOX 1). Advances in molecular biology have revealed the ability of food-derived signals to influence energy metabolism and synaptic plasticity and, thus, mediate the effects of food on cognitive function, which is likely to have been crucial for the evolution of the modern brain. Feeding habits have been intrinsically associated with the development of human civilization, as people’s choice of what to eat is influenced...[Content truncated]",

Grafting of apricots began about 600 CE with defined cultivars developed after this time. There are at least 11 cities in China that contain xing (apricot) as part of their name. The closely related P. mume , Japanese apricot, noted for its early bloom, which is especially revered in China for their gnarled branches, profuse early flowering, and fragrance. Painting of this species is a specialized art form. \nIn Central Asia, the apricot appears to have become naturalized in Sogdiana (associated with fabled trading city of Samarkand) as well as Armenia, but the lack of wild apricots suggests that Armenia is merely the route through which apricots entered Europe. Alexander the Great brought the apricot to Greece and Epirus (Albania), from whence it reached Italy. Mention by Dioscorides and Columella and Pliny but not by Theophrastus, Cato and Varro, indicate an arrival into Rome by the 1 st century CE. Armenia was attacked by Roman legions through Syria in 69–63 BCE, and this may explain its introduction to Rome. \nThroughout its history, apricot has been noted for delicious flavor, delicate velvety fruit surface, and early flowering and fruiting. The name apricot is a corruption of the Arabic and Greek al-praecox which means the early fruit. The old spelling “apricock” is retained in English until the 17th century. The fruits are mainly consumed fresh but are also cooked and often stuffed. The high sugar content makes them suitable for drying. In China they were also preserved by salting and smoking. Other uses include fruit leathers, nectars, and liquors. Current breeding efforts are directed toward increasing fruit size, adaptability, hardiness, and processing quality (Layne et al. 1996). \nCherry. Cherry consists of three main groups: the sweet cherry ( Prunus avium , 2 n=16); the tart (sour) cherry ( P. cerasus , 2 n=32); and the ground cherry ( P. fruiticosa , 2 n=32). Tart cherries are hybrids between sweet cherry and ground cherry via non-reduced gametes. Natural...[Content truncated]",
