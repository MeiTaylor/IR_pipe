Becker\nApril 1, 2016\n•4 min read\nIn a video that went viral last week, a bearded, plaid-wearing man named  earnestly describes how to make a banana-kiwi hybrid (baniwi? kiwana?) by squishing together chunks of the two fruits, burying them in soil, watering them, and waiting. When this hybrid matures, he says in a voiceover, it grows into a fruit with the shape and skin of a banana and the bright-green flesh of a kiwi.\nSo is this subterranean, fruity embrace really how hybrids like pluots or tangelos are actually made?\nNo. It’s really, really not.\nMahar—who makes video tutorials for do-it-yourself crafts—originally posted his faux banana-kiwi hybridization lesson as part of a  on April 1, 2014. If the date he published the video on YouTube wasn’t enough of a clue, he wished viewers a happy April Fools’ Day at the end and suggested in its description that whoever managed to get this technique to work should go buy a lottery ticket.\nBut then earlier this month, a truncated banana-kiwi clip  by the Facebook group  (which Mahar says he has no affiliation with) and has since been viewed more than 69 million times. The truncated tutorial was convincing enough that , which Mahar says he was tickled to see.\n“To have them take the time to write an article about something so, in my mind, clearly ridiculous, is incredibly amusing,” he says. He describes fighting hard to maintain his deadpan as the camera crew cracked up during filming.\nBut while it’s impossible to smush together two fruits to grow a hybrid, there is a seed of truth in this video, says , a plant geneticist at the University of California, Davis.\nFor one thing, the kiwis and bananas we eat are each hybrids themselves. Many of the bananas we find in the stores have three sets of chromosomes from two different ancestral species of banana. And the kiwifruit we eat are also polyploid, meaning they have more than two sets of chromosomes that probably accumulated during prehistoric times, when pollen from one species of kiwifruit was...[Content truncated]"

If you take a close look at the end product, it's clearly not real. It even has a stem to connect it to other bananas — just like bananas that grow on the tree. It's simply illogical, but people are sharing this video with comments like \"gotta try this.\"\nIf you watched to the end of the video, you'll...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "Does scientific evidence support hybridizing banana and kiwi as shown in the video?",
        "Answer": "No, scientific evidence does not support the hybridizing of banana and kiwi as shown in the video. The process described in the video is a form of pseudoscience and does not align with how true hybridization occurs.\n\n1. The claim that simply taking a piece of banana and a piece of kiwi, placing them together in soil, and then watering them will result in the growth of a hybrid fruit (a \"baniwi\") is fundamentally flawed. Hybridization typically requires breeding two different species or varieties of plants, which involves genetic material from both parents mixing through methods such as pollination and fertilization, not simply placing pieces of fruit together in soil [Query1_evidence1].\n\n2. The viral video promoting this method was initially created as an April Fools' joke, indicating that it was never intended to be taken seriously. The creator himself mentioned at the end of the video that anyone who succeeded in this method should buy a lottery ticket, highlighting its absurdity [Query1_evidence1].\n\n3. Even though the concept of using parts of plants to grow new plants is valid in certain contexts (such as cuttings from specific plants), the scenario outlined for creating a banana-kiwi hybrid is not scientifically plausible. The resulting fruit depicted in the video, which supposedly combines the physical features of both fruits, would not develop in this manner without proper genetic engineering techniques, which are not referenced or suggested in the video [Query2_evidence2].\n\nIn summary, there is no scientific basis for the method shown in the video, and claims of successfully hybridizing a banana and kiwi in this way are unfounded and misleading.",
