He then proceeds to take out the hybrid from the pot and cuts a slice, revealing the final product.\nThe clip cuts abruptly at the end, and it\u2019s because it\u2019s not the full video. It is cut up and edited in a way that makes it seem real. The original video was posted on the YouTube channel \u201cKin community\u201d on April 1st, 2014. The first clue pointing to this video not authentic is the date it was published (April Fools). If you watch the full video, you can see at the end the creator wishing everyone a happy April Fool\u2019s Day. Then if you proceed to read the description of the video, everything is explained. Quoting the creator, \u201cif you are able to successfully grow the beautiful banana and kiwi combination demonstrated in this video, we recommend you proceed directly to your corner market and purchase a lottery ticket.\u201d This means that if you do get these results, then you better try your luck next with the lottery!\nThe original video has one million views. If you compare the views from the original video to the one posted on Facebook, you can see the effects of social media sharing. Facebook is available everywhere, and anyone can access it and post anything they want. This site is often used as a credible source on arguments and the spreading of news. The thing is, everyone is so ready to share everything that they don\u2019t stop to check if they\u2019re real. While hybrid fruits are possible, a baniwi certainly isn\u2019t one.\nWorks Cited\n\u201cBanana Kiwi Fruit.\u201d Facebook Watch, 13 Mar. 2016, https://www.facebook.com/FoodsAround/videos/866522853458163/.\n\u201cBanana Kiwi Fruit | Kin Community.\u201d YouTube, 1 Apr. 2014, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rn08tINChA&feature=youtu.be.\nEvon, Dan. \u201cFACT CHECK: How to Create a Hybrid Kiwi-Banana Fruit.\u201d Snopes.com, 17 Mar. 2016, https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/banana-kiwi-hoax-video/.\n--\n--\nHelp\nStatus\nAbout\nCareers\nPress\nBlog\nPrivacy\nTerms\nText to speech\nTeams",

It is actually the edible berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia. The most common commercialized variety is the fuzzy kiwifruit, Actinidia deliciosa. Kiwifruit is native to China but is also grown in various other countries, such as New Zealand, Italy, and Chile. It is a popular fruit known for its bright green flesh and sweet-tart flavor, as well as being a good source of vitamin C, vitamin K, and dietary fiber.\nUpvote \u00b7\n]\nFormer Truck Driver Storeman at Economech Services (1990\u20132020) \u00b7 Author has 487 answers and 129.6K answer views\n\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0\nNo and certainly genetically modified, if you used a little logic you would understand that N.Z. needs the image of PURE and Quality to ALL of their products.

Enterprising growers breed mash-ups\u2014both deliberately and accidentally\u2014to create new, and often entertainingly named  that highlight the best parts of each, while making a splash of their own.\nMost of these  are real, but one is a fake. Try to spot it.\nPeacherine\n----------\nThis peach-nectarine hybrid minimizes the outer fuzz of the former while maintaining its incomparable sweet, bursting flavor. Century-plus old volumes of the American Pomological Society records credit J. W. Philippi for at least one new kind of grape, and a 1908 letter to the editor from him in the _Pacific Rural Press_ expresses strong views on his potato hybridizing practices, but the peacherine may be Philippi's most delicious legacy.\nPlumcot\n-------\nBefore there were pluots\u2014which are primarily plum\u2014there were plumcots. In the late 19th century, a plant breeder named Luther Burbank developed this apricot-plum hybrid that's an equal, even mix of the two. They aren't especially easy to grow, and don't take well to harvesting and shipping, so a few enterprising breeders began crossing plumcots with plums to devise a more desirable mix for market. The flip side\u2014with more apricot and a fuzzier skin\u2014is called an aprium.\nTangelo\n-------\nCross a tangerine with a pomelo or a grapefruit, and boop\u2014you've got a tangelo. This distinctive-looking fruit has a rather pronounced nipple at one end, is extremely juicy with a sweet start and a tart finish, and is bred to be easy to peel. Walter Tennyson Swingle is credited with introducing the earliest tangelo hybrid in 1897 and went on to perfect them throughout his career. See a Minneola or Honeybell on the shelves? You've got him to thank.\nBakiwi\n------\nBananas and kiwis are an irrefutably excellent flavor combo, so it was just a matter of time before someone thought to mash them up.

Becker\nApril 1, 2016\n\u20224 min read\nIn a video that went viral last week, a bearded, plaid-wearing man named  earnestly describes how to make a banana-kiwi hybrid (baniwi? kiwana?) by squishing together chunks of the two fruits, burying them in soil, watering them, and waiting. When this hybrid matures, he says in a voiceover, it grows into a fruit with the shape and skin of a banana and the bright-green flesh of a kiwi.\nSo is this subterranean, fruity embrace really how hybrids like pluots or tangelos are actually made?\nNo. It\u2019s really, really not.\nMahar\u2014who makes video tutorials for do-it-yourself crafts\u2014originally posted his faux banana-kiwi hybridization lesson as part of a  on April 1, 2014. If the date he published the video on YouTube wasn\u2019t enough of a clue, he wished viewers a happy April Fools\u2019 Day at the end and suggested in its description that whoever managed to get this technique to work should go buy a lottery ticket.\nBut then earlier this month, a truncated banana-kiwi clip  by the Facebook group  (which Mahar says he has no affiliation with) and has since been viewed more than 69 million times. The truncated tutorial was convincing enough that , which\u00a0Mahar says he was tickled to see.\n\u201cTo have them take the time to write an article about something so, in my mind, clearly ridiculous, is incredibly amusing,\u201d he says. He describes fighting hard to maintain his deadpan as the camera crew cracked up during filming.\nBut while it\u2019s impossible to smush together two fruits to grow a hybrid, there is a seed of truth...[Content truncated]",

The video gives step-by-step instructions on how to grow your own kiwi inside of a . Awesome, right? But is it true?\nWe consulted with a horticulturist to find out how this works, and why no one had thought of it before. Bernie Hughson, horticulturist with the Arkansas Horticulture Institute, was amazed when he first viewed the video. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my eyes, really.\u201d He said he\u2019s never seen anything like it.\n!\n_The courtship._\nThe video shows a man slicing a banana, and then slicing a kiwi. He purposefully slices the end of the fruit off, instead of slicing them in the middle.\n\u201cThat\u2019s how grafting works,\u201d Hughson explained. \u201cYou take one piece of a plant and you insert one into the other or kind of push them together, and then a process starts that results in a change in the genetic makeup of the plant. You\u2019ve basically created a chimera.\u201d\nIn the video, the man then puts the two pieces of fruit flesh together, seeds touching. That way, the seeds can gently rub one another and stimulate the reproductive process. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty important,\u201d Hughson explains. \u201cThey have to be touching or else it won\u2019t work. Chimeras aren\u2019t created\u00a0via some kind of\u00a0airborne reproduction process.\u201d\nOnce the two pieces of fruit are touching one another, they have to be placed in soil. They should be covered so the reproductive process can continue undisturbed. \u201cI think one inch of soil is fine,\u201d Hughson said in agreement with the video.\n!\n_This image shows the fruits mixing under the soil. The yellow color is banana, and the green is kiwi._\nUnder cover, on a soft bed of fluffy soil, the magic begins to happen. The banana and the kiwi are touching each other,\u00a0and slowly begin to enter one another. The banana usually hardens up a bit, and the kiwi\u00a0releases juices\u00a0that surround the banana. Soon, a softening process begins. The process is quite beautiful to watch, according to Hughson. \u201cIt\u2019s a magical thing.\u201d\nAfter a few weeks, according to the video, your fruit will be ready to harvest. \u201cThis is true,\u201d Hughson confirmed. \u201cThe process takes just a few weeks, and before you know it, you have a hybrid!\u201d\n!\n_A banana kiwi hybrid fruit.

All the articles agree that the kiwi-banana is indeed a false claim. Snopes even points out that this particular Facebook video is a small snippet taken from a longer video that was shared to Facebook on April 1st, 2014. The original video posted in 2014 was posted as an April Fool\u2019s joke; the individual that posted it even pointed out that the kiwi-banana was indeed a joke.\nThere is a article on National Geographic\u2019s website that goes over how it is impossible to be able to squish two fruit to grow a hybrid. National Geographic points out that both bananas and kiwis are already hybrid fruit themselves. They became hybrids because in nature the pollen from one fruit would land onto another resulting in a interspecies hybrid. Hybrid fruits are possible as results of cross pollination, not by squishing two different fruits together and putting them in potting soil.\nConclusion\nWhile social media is without doubt a valuable tool to many people\u2019s lives. Social media platforms have helped friends and family stay connected and has allowed for individuals to be able to share their thoughts and ideas. However, it has become a widely used source for fake news and rumors. Individuals using social media rarely question the validity of articles that show up on their news feeds. It does not take much to fact check the articles that are widely shared around social media; but the reality of it is, most share an article just by the headline without even clicking onto the full article.\nWorks Cited\nBecker, Rachel A. \u201cWhy This April Fools\u2019 Kiwi Hybrid Is Bananas.\u201d Culture, National Geographic, 10 Feb. 2021, www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/april-fools-kiwi-banana-hybrid-video.\nEvon, Dan. \u201cFACT CHECK: How to Create a Hybrid Kiwi-Banana Fruit.\u201d Snopes.com, 14 Aug. 2018, www.snopes.com/fact-check/banana-kiwi-hoax-video/.\n--\n--\nHelp\nStatus\nAbout\nCareers\nPress\nBlog\nPrivacy\nTerms\nText to speech\nTeams",
