    "Judgment": "Yes",
    "Confidence": "95%",
    "Reason": "The provided video transcript contains a clear statement from Donald Trump where he asserts, 'The answer is that there has to be some form of punishment. For the woman? Yeah. There has to be some form.' This directly affirms the claim that Trump stated there should be some form of punishment for women who have abortions. The context of the conversation addresses the implications of banning abortion and the legal ramifications of classifying it as a crime, which reinforces the understanding that he is discussing punishment in this context. Therefore, the existing information is sufficient to judge the truthfulness of the claim as true, with high reliability."
