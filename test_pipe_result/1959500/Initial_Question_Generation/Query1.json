But that has changed a lot recently, ever since developing a keen interest in green tea (and herbal teas).\nThis might sound a tad extreme (or not…I dunno), but I am currently up to 6 or 7 cups of the stuff, on average, each day (still drink a bit of coffee, but not as much). My wife usually has at least a couple of cups of herbal tea each day as well, and so – for the first time _ever_ – I have found myself with a LOT of used tea bags on my hands!\nNaturally, being the worm-head that I am, this got me thinking…(Uh oh! haha)\nI started wondering what it would be like to basically set up a vermicomposting system that would ONLY receive tea bags – nothing else. This just happened to be right around the time that I also checked on my ““, so I knew what I had to do!  \n!\n* * *\nHalf of the material from the badly neglected bin was used for my , and the other half will serve as my starter culture for the tea bag vermicomposting project.\nNOTE: I mentioned above that the plan was to set up a system that will “ONLY receive tea bags”. While this will be true moving forward, I did at least want to help things out a bit by adding some bedding and a little food (other than tea bags) when starting up the system.\n* * *\nThe set-up process was extremely simple. First I added a bit of shredded cardboard (on the empty side), along with my current supply of tea bags.\n!\n* * *\nI then added some water and sprinkled in a small amount of chick starter feed.\n!\n* * *\nNext, I added a bit more cardboard and then simply moved all the wormy material over from the other side. As touched on in my  post, there seemed to be a lot more worms in the material used for the tea bag project, so...[Content truncated]",

Those can come with eggs in them that only hatch after the box has been on your shelf for weeks or months. Freezing kills them. Kinda sucks that the manufacturers aren't required to freeze them before shipping them out.\nEdit: Just realized you mentioned that, so consider my comment a reinforcement for everyone who's not aware of the issue yet.\nReply reply\n4 more replies\n4 more replies\n4 more replies\n4 more replies\n• \nThat's what the boiling water is for.\nReply reply\n14 more replies\n14 more replies\n• \nIs this because Lipton just puts lots...[Content truncated]",

He explained that they use the cheapest grade of tea (dust) available. Also many tea companies mix non-tea additives (fillers) to their tea bags.\nAfter hearing this I decided, if it's not full loose leaf, I don't drink it. We found that companies like Elephant Chateau  deliver the 3 highest grades of tea direct from Ceylon mountain estates with the option for plant-based pyramid bags (soilon) or a free stainless steel infuser.\nBonus, the tea actually tastes like tea and is tasty enough to drink plain unlike Lipton dust. It always funny to hear people promote all the health benefits of tea then turn around and dump 100 grams of sugar into a cup to make it palatable.\nbrokenkebab on Sept 25, 2019 | next \nTo be fair, bagged tea exists because there are lots of buyers who only want quick refreshing non-coffee caffeine, and don't care for taste that much. Or sometimes they just want a background for those 100 g. of sugar you mentioned. Tea dust is a perfect match for this market, because it releases everything it holds to water immediately, while whole leaves may require some patience, and proper procedure.\nmumblemumble on Sept 25, 2019 | parent | next \nFWIW, I'm personally fond of tea dust for...[Content truncated]",

It’s probably nothing to worry about, just some bacteria growing and polyphenols settling out, but I wouldn’t drink that tea.\nAll this relates to the subject of kombucha, the tea based drink derived from letting sweetened versions of teas grow living cultures to change aspects:\n“Scoby” is actually an acronym: Symbiotic Culture Of Bacteria and Yeast. And that’s exactly what it is! A scoby is the living home for the bacteria and yeast that transform sweet tea into tangy, fizzy kombucha — think of the scoby as the coral reef of the bacteria and yeast world. It a rubbery raft that floats on the surface of the kombucha. Aside from being a home for yeast and good bacteria, the scoby seals off the fermenting kombucha from the air and protects it from outside, undesirable bacterias while it’s fermenting.\nYour tea was probably safe enough, but people making kombucha learn what to look out for, for signs of changes that are positive and others that represent risk. I wouldn’t sweat it, but I wouldn’t drink slimy or sour tea. I’ve barely tried any kombucha, but that’s essentially what it is, a tea version that has changed to become sour, and I guess it’s safe enough.\n!\nfrom that article\n!\nvisiting a friend’s tea shop, a cafe section still being set up, with kombucha (fermenting?) in the covered jars.\nLater edit:\nLooking back it occurred to me that this never answers the question, only saying that the compounds in teas can combine in such...[Content truncated]",

In response to the video of Lipton’s Lemon Green Tea bags, Liptop as a company replied “there are no “worms” in our tea bags”. These are small lemon flavour pieces which have been mistaken for worms. If you put these lemon flavour pieces in hot water they will dissolve as you can see from this video. The tea is of the highest quality standard and is absolutely safe to consume.

(Image source: News18)\nThe history of the 2003 Cadbury worm crisis seems to have found its way back to 2024. In January 2022, a man had shared a video that he had found worms in a box of Kellogg’s Chocos. The video has gone viral and has garnered widespread criticism, and also questioned the standards of food safety.\n> \nThe video was posted on Instagram and a response from Kellogg’s Chocos has surfaced. The brand said, “We deeply regret the inconvenience caused to you. Our Consumer Affairs team would get in touch with you to understand your concern. Request you to inbox us your contact details.”\nThis does not end with one example.\nOn February 12, a resident of Hyderabad, Robin Zaccheus, found a live worm in a bar of Cadbury milk chocolate that he had purchased from a store at Ameerpet metro station on Friday.\nTaking to X, he wrote, “Found a worm crawling in Cadbury chocolate purchased at Ratnadeep Metro Ameerpet today.. Is there a quality check for these near to expiry products? Who is responsible for public health hazards?”\n> Found a worm crawling in Cadbury chocolate purchased at Ratnadeep Metro Ameerpet today..  \n>   \n> Is there a quality check for these near to expiry products?

In fact, they only found one brand that didn’t: Jacksons of Picadilly. A  also published in 2010 stated that (according to the UK Tea Council) 96% of those 165 million cups of tea drunk in the UK every day were made with teabags. It also revealed that Twinings, Clipper, Tetley and Typhoo also make their teabags using plastic.\nTwinings! I was so pleased last year when I thought I’d finally found a plastic-free brand of teabag. Now I find that they may not use plastic in their packaging but they’re using it in the actual teabag!\nSomething else caught my eye in the article, and it made me really mad. It’s a quote from Teadirect’s Whitney Kakos (who according to the internet, was the Sustainability Manager for Teadirect in 2010). She said: “Most consumers don’t notice \\ and probably don’t care.”\nWell I’ve noticed, and I care, and I don’t think I’m the only one!\n**Revelation Three: The Research is OLD but the findings are CURRENT**\n======================================================================\nThese articles were written in 2010, which was four years ago, so it’s possible that things have changed. Whilst I was busy researching all of this, by chance (or destiny?!) another plastic-free blogger  was doing her own research into teabags, and contacting all the companies in question asking whether they still use plastic in their teabags.\nNot writing letters and sitting patiently for a reply, she was straight onto Twitter to find out what was going on.\nHere’s what she asked:\n_\\ Can you please let me know if you use plasticisers, or a similar material, in your tea bags? Thank you._\nHere are the answers (so far):\n!\n(There’s since been a phone call to PG Tips, who confirmed that yes, their teabags contain plastic).\n**Revelation Five: The World’s gone Mad**\n=========================================\nThis is the final revelation: something I discovered yesterday. You can now buy tea in individual plastic pods (like the coffee pods)!\n!Individual portions of tea in individual single-use plastic pods. What a waste. Photo borrowed from my friend Amy.\nThese aren’t teabags containing plastic, they’re worse! Individual plastic pods with single portions of tea! What’s wrong...[Content truncated]",
