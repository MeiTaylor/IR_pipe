The end product is **compost**. Microorganisms feed on the materials added to the compost pile during the composting process. They use carbon and nitrogen to grow and reproduce, water to digest materials, and oxygen to breathe.\nYou can compost at home using food scraps from your kitchen and dry leaves and woody material from your yard.\nWhy Compost at Home?\n--------------------\nComposting is nature’s way of recycling. It is one of the most powerful actions we can take to reduce our trash, address climate change, and build healthy soil. By turning our food scraps and yard trim into compost, we transform our waste streams into a beneficial, value-added soil amendment and use it to protect the environment and create resilient communities.\n*   Composting is a resourceful way to recycle the food scraps and yard trim you generate at home all year and manage your waste more sustainably.\n*   You reduce the volume of materials that might otherwise be disposed of in landfills or trash incinerators – leaves, grass clippings, yard trim, and food scraps – and prevent powerful greenhouse gases from being emitted into the atmosphere.\n*   Composting involves minimal effort, equipment, expense, and expertise and can be fun. \n*   You save money by producing a free, high-quality soil amendment – compost – which reduces your use of fertilizer and pesticides.\n*   You can use your compost to build healthier soil, prevent soil erosion, conserve water, and improve plant growth in your garden and yard.\nOptions for Composting at Home\n------------------------------\nThere are different ways to compost at home:\n*   Backyard composting.\n*   \nIf you don’t have a space for composting, consider participating in a local municipal or community composting program which may...[Content truncated]",

Over one-third of all available food goes uneaten through loss or waste. Composting keeps food waste out of landfills where it decomposes and releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas.\nStart vermicomposting by  from North Carolina State University Extension:\n1.  **Select Container**: Make your own bin from plastic or wood storage containers or purchase one. Worm bins require holes for aeration and drainage.\n2.  **Bin Location**: The temperature inside a worm bin should be 59-77 degrees F. The bin can be kept indoors or outdoors in the shade. During colder months, insulate an outdoor bin with blankets, straw, or other material to keep it warm.\n3.  **Worm Bin Setup**:\n*   Create a bedding of shredded paper (black and white newspaper, non-glossy office paper, paper bags, or cardboard) or dried leaves. Soak the material for ten minutes, wring out excess water, and place it in the bin with a handful of soil.\n*   Add at least one pound of worms to your bin. There are over 9,000 species of earthworms, but only seven are suitable for vermicomposting. Red wigglers, which you can buy from a worm grower, are recommended. Do not use worms from a bait shop or your garden since they will not thrive in your bin.\n*   Feed your worms vegetable and fruit scraps, coffee grounds, tea bags, and crushed eggshells. Avoid meat...[Content truncated]",

Ailments included liver problems, lactic acidosis (a buildup of lactic acid in the body), allergic reactions, and nausea.\nFor this reason, the CDC recommends drinking only 4 ounces of kombucha daily. Overconsumption can lead to side effects, including headache, nausea, and upset stomach.  \nIs kombucha safe?\nWhen properly prepared and drank in moderation, kombucha is generally considered safe. \nIs kombucha safe during pregnancy?\nIf you’re pregnant, experts advise against drinking homemade or store-bought kombucha. There are two primary reasons: alcohol and caffeine. Because kombucha may contain even a low level of alcohol, it’s considered a risk to pregnant women. Likewise, the caffeine levels in kombucha may not be ideal for moms-to-be. There is also the possibility of bacterial contamination in kombucha, especially if made at home.\nIs kombucha safe for kids?\nKombucha is not recommended for young children. Older children may enjoy kombucha, but because it contains caffeine and small amounts of alcohol, experts recommend limiting your child’s daily kombucha consumption.\nCan you drink kombucha every day?\nIf you are pregnant or have a weakened immune system due to illness or treatment for an illness, you should avoid drinking kombucha. Otherwise, in moderation, you can drink kombucha daily. \nToday, commercially produced kombucha drinks can be purchased in most grocery and convenience stores and ordered online. If you want to make kombucha at home, kombucha kits, including the starter liquid and SCOBY, may be purchased online or specialty health food stores.\nHow long is kombucha good for after opening?\nStore-bought kombucha may last in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week after opening. After a week, your kombucha may lose its fizz and nutritional value. Kombucha gone bad will smell and taste vinegary and may look cloudy or slimy — and should be thrown away.\nKombucha is an ancient fermented tea that may have many health benefits, such as improving digestion, boosting the immune system, lowering cholesterol levels, and supporting cardiovascular health. Today kombucha is widely available in stores, and kombucha starter kits can be purchased to make at home. It’s important to follow safety guidelines when making kombucha at home to avoid contamination that could lead to potential food poisoning. \nWhat does drinking kombucha do for you?\nDrinking kombucha may provide a variety of health benefits from aiding in digestion, to ridding your body of toxins and boosting energy levels.

However, the two types of teabags made from a combination of cellulose and PLA broke down into smaller pieces, losing between 60% and 80% of their overall mass and with the PLA component remaining.\nThe study also examined the impacts of the discs cut from the teabags on a species of earthworm, Eisenia fetida, which has a critical role in soil nutrient turnover as it consumes organic matter.\nResearchers found that being exposed to three different concentrations of teabag discs -- equivalent to the mass of half, one and two teabags -- resulted in up to 15% greater mortality, while some concentrations of PLA had a detrimental effect on earthworm reproduction.\nWriting in the journal Science of the Total Environment, the study's authors highlight the need for accurate disposal information to be clearly displayed on product packaging.\nOnly one of the manufacturers whose products were chosen for the study indicated on the packaging that the teabags were not home compostable.\nThis could lead to them ending up in soil, while there is also high potential for consumer confusion...[Content truncated]",

The pupae look like small sleeping bags. This stage lasts 7-20 days, depending on the temperature.\n*   **Adult.** Finally, the pupa splits open, and the adult moth crawls out and opens its wings to fly. They'll begin mating and lay eggs 3 days after emergence.\n**How long do moths live?**\nMany moths have short lives. Some only last a few days after reaching the adult stage and mating. Certain species of moths will live for a few months, or even longer.\n**Do moths bite?**\nAdult moths don't bite or sting. There is an exception with the vampire moth species, however. Vampire moths, like mosquitoes, can bite and suck the blood from animals and humans. This behavior has only been observed in male vampire moths.\nPantry moths are common household pests. They are small flying insects that infest or contaminate stored pantry goods such as grain, cereal, flour, and other dry food. They are also known as grain moths or Indian meal moths because they commonly infest powdered Indian corn or cornmeal in America.\nPantry moths are attracted to food sources in your pantry, which they eat, and then they lay eggs. Adult females can lay hundreds of eggs at a time, and the larvae can chew through thin cardboard and plastic bags storing your food. The larvae feed on these food sources, making them inedible. Pantry moths can be difficult to get rid of once they infest the food in your pantry.\nIdentifying each moth species can be difficult since there are many types of moths. Most moth species look like their butterfly cousin but with duller colors and patterns. Aside from the differences in colors, they also differ in size.\n**Clothes moth**\nSome home-invading moths are referred to as clothes moths because they are attracted to fabric. Two species of clothes moths are the webbing clothes moth and the casemaking clothes moth.\n*   The **webbing clothes moth** is more common than the casemaking clothes moth. Webbing clothes moths have golden bodies with red and gold hair on their heads and wings. Their wings are around 1/2-inch wide. They’re known to be weak flyers and aren’t attracted to light sources, so you’ll usually find them hiding inside closets. They tend to chew on and damage fabrics...[Content truncated]",

These living fertilizer tubes are full of countless beneficial bacteria and enzymes that help sustain the life and fertility of our horticultural and agricultural systems. Worms dig and aerate the soil, allowing more water to soak in.\nWhen living in your worm farm, worms will eat up to 3-4kg of your kitchen waste every week, then turn it into worm castings (rich plant food) and worm tea (liquid fertilizer) that can be used to improve the health of your garden.\nKeeping a worm farm is fun for the whole family and a great way to get everyone involved in nurturing the environment and making your home more sustainable.\nTHE A.D.A.M PRINCIPLE\n---------------------\nFollow the A.D.A.M principle to keep your compost bin healthy and happy:\n*   !\n    ALIVENESS\n    Compost is a ‘living creature’ full of worms and healthy microbes.\n*   !\n    DIVERSITY\n    Mix a variety of ingredients into your compost bin, such  \n    as food scraps, dry leaves, fine woody mulch, grass, hair,  \n    herbs etc. After all, variety is the spice of life!\n*   !\n    AERATION\n    Use an aerating tool to aerate your  \n    compost regularly.\n*   !\n    MOISTURE\n    All living things need water, but make sure  \n    your compost is not too wet and doesn’t  \n    become dry like a wrung-out sponge.\n!\nFUN FACT\n--------\nThe word Adam comes from the word ADAMAH, meaning ‘Earth’ or ‘Red Clay’.\nWhat to Recycle!\n----------------\nWorms will eat anything that was once living,\n*   Leftover vegetable scraps, fruit and vegetable peelings\n*   Tea leaves...[Content truncated]",

If a product doesn't match all the information in the recall completely (brand, product name, use or freeze by date, EST number, etc.), then it is not considered part of the recall and is safe to use.\nIf the product details in the recall notice match the details on the food product you have at home, do not open or consume the product. Instead, do one of the following:\n*   **Return the product** to the place of purchase for a refund.\n*   **Dispose of the product** following the instructions provided in the recall notice to make sure no one will consume it.\n### Food Safety Recalls\n### What is a Food Recall?\nA food recall occurs when a food producer takes a product off the market because there is reason to believe that it may cause consumers to become...[Content truncated]",

Bug Shit Tea, Moth Poop Tea or Pearl tea.\nIf you've tried civet coffee you may like to try Worm Poo Tea!\nBugapoop Tea is a special tea made from the feces of grain moth larvae. These larvae are fed on nothing else but special tea leaves (Camellia sinensis) that have been naturally fermented. As the leaves pass through the larvae's body they continue fermentation. Their droppings are handpicked and the collected droppings are dried and then further aged. \nBugapoop or General Pearl Tea as it's originally known as in China is black in color, freshly fragrant, and has been used for a long time in the mountain areas of Guangxi, Funan and Guixhou by the Zhuan, Tong and Miao nationalities. According to historical records it has positive health benefits for fever, high blood pressure, digestion and it has good detoxifying properties. Whatever the extent of its health benefits, Bug A Poop serves as a good “cooling beverage” which has a higher nutritive value than regular tea. It contains 18 kinds of amino-acids, protein, Saccharide, tannin, vitamins, and microelements.\nHow to use:\nAdd one tea bag to a cup and pour in boiling water, allow it to steep for 20 seconds. You can repeat the steeping process with several cups of hot water until you achieve your desired taste. Further steeping results in a mellower, sweeter and less pungent taste.\nIngredients: \nDroppings of Andraca theae (Andraca theae worms are fed on Camellia sinensis tea plant).\nNet Weight 8g - 5 x tea bags\n      2 reviews / Write a review\nTags:\n                 Bugapoop tea,\n                         worm poo tea,\n                         moth poo tea  \nThis bag contains one old-world edible Tarantula (Cyriopagopus albostriatus, previously Haplopelma A..\n$9.80        \nDiscover the Amazing Silk Moth Educational Gift Set from Thailand Unique!
