You can see there are living worms inside.\n\"It's not one or two, it's a lot.\"\nShe then opens a second teabag and claims to discover even more worms.\nClaims: Ismat says she found worms in her lemon green teabag (\nImage:\nIsmat Raza)\nIsmat confirmed that the teabags were packaged in November 2015. The expiry date was reportedly in October 2017.\nThe video was supposedly filmed in Dubai before being shared on social media.\nLipton immediately posted a response to the video  , writing: \"In response to the video of Lipton's Lemon Green Tea bags, there are no \u201cworms\u201d in our tea bags.\n\"These are small lemon flavour pieces which have been mistaken for worms.

But that has changed a lot recently, ever since developing a keen interest in green tea (and herbal teas).\nThis might sound a tad extreme (or not\u2026I dunno), but I am currently up to 6 or 7 cups of the stuff, on average, each day (still drink a bit of coffee, but not as much). My wife usually has at least a couple of cups of herbal tea each day as well, and so \u2013 for the first time _ever_ \u2013 I have found myself with a LOT of used tea bags on my hands!\nNaturally, being the worm-head that I am, this got me thinking\u2026(Uh oh! haha)\nI started wondering what it would be like to basically set up a vermicomposting system that would ONLY receive tea bags \u2013 nothing else. This just happened to be right around the time that I also checked on my \u201c\u201c, so I knew what I had to do!  \n!\n* * *\nHalf of the material from the badly neglected bin was used for my , and the other half will serve as my starter culture for the tea bag vermicomposting project.\nNOTE: I mentioned above that the plan was to set up a system that will \u201cONLY receive tea bags\u201d. While this will be true moving forward, I did at least want to help things out a bit by adding some bedding and a little food (other than tea bags) when starting up the system.\n* * *\nThe set-up process was extremely simple. First I added a bit of shredded cardboard (on the empty side), along with my current supply of tea bags.\n!\n* * *\nI then added some water and sprinkled in a small amount of chick starter feed.\n!\n* * *\nNext, I added a bit more cardboard and then simply moved all the wormy material over from the other side. As touched on in my  post, there seemed to be a lot more worms in the material used for the tea bag project, so...[Content truncated]",

He explained that they use the cheapest grade of tea (dust) available. Also many tea companies mix non-tea additives (fillers) to their tea bags.\nAfter hearing this I decided, if it's not full loose leaf, I don't drink it. We found that companies like Elephant Chateau  deliver the 3 highest grades of tea direct from Ceylon mountain estates with the option for plant-based pyramid bags (soilon) or a free stainless steel infuser.\nBonus, the tea actually tastes like tea and is tasty enough to drink plain unlike Lipton dust. It always funny to hear people promote all the health benefits of tea then turn around and dump 100 grams of sugar into a cup to make it palatable.\nbrokenkebab on Sept 25, 2019 | next \nTo be fair, bagged tea exists because there are lots of buyers who only want quick refreshing non-coffee caffeine, and don't care for taste that much. Or sometimes they just want a background for those 100 g. of sugar you mentioned. Tea dust is a perfect match for this market, because it releases everything it holds to water immediately, while whole leaves may require some patience, and proper procedure.\nmumblemumble on Sept 25, 2019 | parent | next \nFWIW, I'm personally fond of tea dust for...[Content truncated]",

In fact, they only found one brand that didn\u2019t: Jacksons of Picadilly. A  also published in 2010 stated that (according to the UK Tea Council) 96% of those 165 million cups of tea drunk in the UK every day were made with teabags. It also revealed that Twinings, Clipper, Tetley and Typhoo also make their teabags using plastic.\nTwinings! I was so pleased last year when I thought I\u2019d finally found a plastic-free brand of teabag. Now I find that they may not use plastic in their packaging but they\u2019re using it in the actual teabag!\nSomething else caught my eye in the article, and it made me really mad. It\u2019s a quote from Teadirect\u2019s Whitney Kakos (who according to the internet, was the Sustainability Manager for Teadirect in 2010). She said: \u201cMost consumers don\u2019t notice \\ and probably don\u2019t care.\u201d\nWell I\u2019ve noticed, and I care, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only one!\n**Revelation Three: The Research is OLD but the findings are CURRENT**\n======================================================================\nThese articles were written in 2010, which was four years ago, so it\u2019s possible that things have changed. Whilst I was busy researching all of this, by chance (or destiny?!) another plastic-free blogger  was doing her own research into teabags, and contacting all the companies in question asking whether they still use plastic in their teabags.\nNot writing letters and sitting patiently for a reply, she was straight onto Twitter to find out what was going on.\nHere\u2019s what she asked:\n_\\ Can you please let me know if you use plasticisers, or a similar material, in your tea bags? Thank you._\nHere are the answers (so far):\n!\n(There\u2019s since been a phone call to PG Tips, who confirmed that yes, their teabags contain plastic).\n**Revelation Five: The World\u2019s gone Mad**\n=========================================\nThis is the final revelation: something I discovered yesterday. You can now buy tea in individual plastic pods (like the coffee pods)!\n!Individual portions of tea in individual single-use plastic pods. What a waste. Photo borrowed from my friend Amy.\nThese aren\u2019t teabags containing plastic, they\u2019re worse! Individual plastic pods with single portions of tea! What\u2019s wrong...[Content truncated]",
