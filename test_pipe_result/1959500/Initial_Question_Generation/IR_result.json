However, the two types of teabags made from a combination of cellulose and PLA broke down into smaller pieces, losing between 60% and 80% of their overall mass and with the PLA component remaining.\nThe study also examined the impacts of the discs cut from the teabags on a species of earthworm, Eisenia fetida, which has a critical role in soil nutrient turnover as it consumes organic matter.\nResearchers found that being exposed to three different concentrations of teabag discs -- equivalent to the mass of half, one and two teabags -- resulted in up to 15% greater mortality, while some concentrations of PLA had a detrimental effect on earthworm reproduction.\nWriting in the journal Science of the Total Environment, the study's authors highlight the need for accurate disposal information to be clearly displayed on product packaging.\nOnly one of the manufacturers whose products were chosen for the study indicated on the packaging that the teabags were not home compostable.\nThis could lead to them ending up in soil, while there is also high potential for consumer confusion...[Content truncated]",

The end product is **compost**. Microorganisms feed on the materials added to the compost pile during the composting process. They use carbon and nitrogen to grow and reproduce, water to digest materials, and oxygen to breathe.\nYou can compost at home using food scraps from your kitchen and dry leaves and woody material from your yard.\nWhy Compost at Home?\n--------------------\nComposting is nature’s way of recycling. It is one of the most powerful actions we can take to reduce our trash, address climate change, and build healthy soil. By turning our food scraps and yard trim into compost, we transform our waste streams into a beneficial, value-added soil amendment and use it to protect the environment and create resilient communities.\n*   Composting is a resourceful way to recycle the food scraps and yard trim you generate at home all year and manage your waste more sustainably.\n*   You reduce the volume of materials that might otherwise be disposed of in landfills or trash incinerators – leaves, grass clippings, yard trim, and food scraps – and prevent powerful greenhouse gases from being emitted into the atmosphere.\n*   Composting involves minimal effort, equipment, expense, and expertise and can be fun. \n*   You save money by producing a free, high-quality soil amendment – compost – which reduces your use of fertilizer and pesticides.\n*   You can use your compost to build healthier soil, prevent soil erosion, conserve water, and improve plant growth in your garden and yard.\nOptions for Composting at Home\n------------------------------\nThere are different ways to compost at home:\n*   Backyard composting.\n*   \nIf you don’t have a space for composting, consider participating in a local municipal or community composting program which may...[Content truncated]",

Ailments included liver problems, lactic acidosis (a buildup of lactic acid in the body), allergic reactions, and nausea.\nFor this reason, the CDC recommends drinking only 4 ounces of kombucha daily. Overconsumption can lead to side effects, including headache, nausea, and upset stomach.  \nIs kombucha safe?\nWhen properly prepared and drank in moderation, kombucha is generally considered safe. \nIs kombucha safe during pregnancy?\nIf you’re pregnant, experts advise against drinking homemade or store-bought kombucha. There are two primary reasons: alcohol and caffeine. Because kombucha may contain even a low level of alcohol, it’s considered a risk to pregnant women. Likewise, the caffeine levels in kombucha may not be ideal for moms-to-be. There is also the possibility of bacterial contamination in kombucha, especially if made at home.\nIs kombucha safe for kids?\nKombucha is not recommended for young children. Older children may enjoy kombucha, but because it contains caffeine and small amounts of alcohol, experts recommend limiting your child’s daily kombucha consumption.\nCan you drink kombucha every day?\nIf you are pregnant or have a weakened immune system due to illness or treatment for an illness, you should avoid drinking kombucha. Otherwise, in moderation, you can drink kombucha daily. \nToday, commercially produced kombucha drinks can be purchased in most grocery and convenience stores and ordered online. If you want to make kombucha at home, kombucha kits, including the starter liquid and SCOBY, may be purchased online or specialty health food stores.\nHow long is kombucha good for after opening?\nStore-bought kombucha may last in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week after opening. After a week, your kombucha may lose its fizz and nutritional value. Kombucha gone bad will smell and taste vinegary and may look cloudy or slimy — and should be thrown away.\nKombucha is an ancient fermented tea that may have many health benefits, such as improving digestion, boosting the immune system, lowering cholesterol levels, and supporting cardiovascular health. Today kombucha is widely available in stores, and kombucha starter kits can be purchased to make at home. It’s important to follow safety guidelines when making kombucha at home to avoid contamination that could lead to potential food poisoning. \nWhat does drinking kombucha do for you?\nDrinking kombucha may provide a variety of health benefits from aiding in digestion, to ridding your body of toxins and boosting energy levels.

        "Question": "What evidence exists to support the claim of live worms in Lipton lemon flavor green tea bags?",
        "Answer": "The claim that there are live worms in Lipton lemon flavor green tea bags is primarily supported by a viral video where a person allegedly found worms in multiple tea bags of this flavor. The video transcript shows the person stating that they opened different bags and found living worms inside them, suggesting it was a widespread issue with this specific tea variety. However, the evidence presented by Lipton directly contradicts this claim. Lipton responded to the video by explaining that what appeared to be worms were, in fact, small pieces of lemon flavoring that had been mistaken for worms. They clarified that these pieces dissolve in hot water and affirmed that the tea is safe for consumption, reflecting a high-quality standard. This response was further backed by authorities, with the Dubai Municipality supporting Lipton's claims about the nature of the contents in the tea bags. There are also anecdotal accounts from individuals, such as one who claimed that a friend worked for Lipton and indicated that the tea incorporates non-tea additives or fillers, which could potentially lead to confusion about the contents of the tea bags. However, this does not directly support the existence of worms but rather raises concerns about the quality of tea. Another blog reference discusses foreign objects being found, but it lacks specific evidence or clarity on the nature of those objects, and thus doesn't provide strong corroborative support for the claim of worms. In conclusion, while the initial video raised concerns about the presence of live worms in Lipton’s lemon flavor green tea, substantial counter-evidence from Lipton and local authorities disputes this claim. The consensus suggests that the supposed worms were not actually worms, but rather lemon flavor bits.",
