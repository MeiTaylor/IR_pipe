Tea Bags Can Tell Us.**\nGabriella Gimson, a physical geography student at University of Saint Andrews (Scotland, UK), is analyzing unearthed tea bags at San Elijo Lagoon. For her senior thesis, Gabriella is focusing on carbon storage in the wetland soil of San Elijo Lagoon Ecological Reserve.\nShe partnered with our Science Research Director Tim Stillinger to access the lagoon for her testing. (Gabriella is one of the participating student researchers in our collegiate collective.)\nShe is using the Tea Bag Index\u2014a method that measures the decomposition rates of Lipton tea bags buried in soil. This simple method enables standardized measurements in wetlands around the globe, at a scale not possible with more expensive or complicated monitoring methods.\n!(blob:https://naturecollective.org/196f44e8ef8fdd91d076cdccd2ab95b8)\n_Above: Gabriella Gimson observes Lipton tea bags unearthed from 8-centimeters deep within designated soil installation sites at San Elijo Lagoon._\nDecomposition is a natural process that produces greenhouse carbon dioxide.

(2013) \\\\], provides standardized litter decomposition data due to uniformity of the litters and bags, which is necessary for large-scale analysis of the effects of environmental factors on decomposition rates. The tea bag method uses commercially available tetra-shaped tea bags of green tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze) and rooibos tea (Aspalathus linearis (Burm. f.) R. Dahlgren), produced by Lipton, as a substitute for litters and soil organic matter. In the method, the amount of tea leaves decomposed during a 90-day incubation period is used to calculate the decomposition constant k and stabilization factor S (Tea Bag Index) \\\\]. Temporal variations in chemical composition during the decomposition process exhibited were typical of local leaf litters \\\\], indicating that tea bags can be representative of local litters. A large number of studies have used the tea bag method to assess decomposition potential \\,,,,,\\].\nHowever, it remains uncertain whether tea bag decomposition in response to wetness is representative of that of local litters. Generally, higher decomposition rates are observed in wetter conditions, but excess water inhibits decomposition: according to Prescott (2010), water contents higher than 80% (wet weight basis) suppresses litter decomposition rates. By contrast, a field experiment reported that tea bag decomposition was not suppressed, even at high water contents, based on comparison of tea bag decomposition data obtained from various study sites \\\\]. Tea leaves may have large water-leachable fractions, where the inhibitory impact of very high water content on litter decomposition may be negated by large leaching fractions under wetter conditions. If this is the case, tea bags should not be used to determine litter decomposition rates under high soil water contents. In field studies, however, other environmental factors covary with soil water content, so it remains unclear whether the effect of soil water on tea bag decomposition becomes inhibitory at higher water contents. In the present study, we performed laboratory incubation and leaching experiments to clarify the effect of water content on tea bag decomposition, and the potential contribution of leaching loss.\nTo utilize the tea bag method to test the impact of environmental changes on litter decomposition at a large scale, a practical issue must be resolved first. Lipton changed the mesh materials for its tea bags from woven nylon mesh (0.25 mm...[Content truncated]",

However, this tea bag cannot be easily found in Australia, having to be imported from Europe. The 90-day incubation period also poses problems for school and citizen science projects, such as missing tea bags and organism-induced damage.\nThe study aims to: (1) investigate the suitable alternative Australian tea bag brands for the decomposition studies; (2) assess the potential for reducing the incubation period; and (3) evaluate the priming effects of different substrates on decomposition rate.\nThe feasibility of two local Australian tea bag brands (Madame Flavour or T2) was compared to Lipton by collecting time-series data over the incubation period in pot experiments with the addition of sugar, citric acid and microplastic.\nWe found an alternative tea brand that can be used for TBI in Australia.\n(1) Madame Flavour tea bags can be used as an alternative litter material for the TBI in Australia. (2) The incubation period potentially could be reduced to 21\u00a0days, with another sampling taken on day 4 and 14.

TeaComposition is a citizen science project introducing the Tea Bag Index (TBI) method to students in Australia to support research on soil decomposition using tea bags (green and rooibos). Soil microbial driven decomposition is an essential soil function that releases soil organic matter (SOM) and nutrients, i.e., soil ecosystem services. The TBI experiments enable citizens to understand this process (increasing soil connectivity) and this information is valuable for assessing urban soil conditions. With 430 TBI in-field incubations between 2017 and 2020, this project engaged more than 3200 students who tested the TBI method on more than 50 school grounds and collected soil samples for analyses of soil properties.

TeaComposition is a citizen science project introducing the Tea Bag Index (TBI) method to students in Australia to support research on soil decomposition using tea bags (green and rooibos). Soil microbial driven decomposition is an essential soil function that releases soil organic matter (SOM) and nutrients, i.e., soil ecosystem services. The TBI experiments enable citizens to understand this process (increasing soil connectivity) and this information is valuable for assessing urban soil conditions. With 430 TBI in-field incubations between 2017 and 2020, this project engaged more than 3200 students who tested the TBI method on more than 50 school grounds and collected soil samples for analyses of soil properties. Approximately 50% of the tea bags were recovered and mean TBI parameters were: decomposition rate (k)\u00a0=\u00a00.02 gd\u22121 and stabilisation factor (S)\u00a0=\u00a00.32. Soil texture, SOC and SI had the most significant relationships with TBI. Clay and Slaking Index (SI) had negative impacts on k (rs\u00a0=\u00a0-0.37, -0.22, _p_\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05, respectively) and SOC had a negative effect for S (rs\\=-0.27; _p_\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). These results suggest a combination of high clay and SOC may be related to reduced potential for C sequestration. Regarding citizen science, this study suggests further research using a local tea brand and shorter burials. This suggestion aims to increase Australian citizen participation.\nKeywords\n--------\nCitizen science\nSoil decomposition\nTea Bag Index\nSoil connectivity\nCited by (0)\n------------\n\u00a9 2021 The University of Sydney.

Thousands of plastic compounds are used across the world today, and of those, more than 20% have been classified by the European Union as being of concern due to their persistence, accumulation in human fatty tissues, and/or toxicity, while 39% have not been linked to any negative health effects. MP pollution poses a health concern. The more plastic created, the more the subsequent generation will have to endure it is unknowable impacts, which might pose an irreparable health danger. Despite the fact that research has mostly concentrated on a small number of plastic compounds, a wide variety of health conditions, including endocrine disruption, reproductive toxicity, cancer risk, problems with metabolism and nutrition, and interference with neurodevelopment, are also a concern.\nDue to the potential health risks and negative impacts on the environment, the use of MPs in tea bags and other products is a major issue. In spite of the material\u2019s nonbiodegradability, polypropylene is frequently used in manufacturing tea bags. Given that tea bags are subjected to high temperatures during the brewing process, it is concerning that certain branded teas are offered in tea bags made from allegedly \u2018food grade\u2019 polymers, such as nylon. In tea bags additionally available are fluorine compounds, arsenic, radium salt, aluminum, copper, lead, mercury, cadmium, barium, nitrates, and many more. So you are sipping tea and consuming these dangerous substances in the same bag. Tea bag plastics, which can take hundreds of years to decompose in nature, may fragment into particles that range in size from 1\u00a0\u00b5m to 5\u00a0mm, or MPs. Instead of utilizing the conventional paper tea bags, tea makers now use plastic ones. This is concerning since water is regularly heated to 95\u00b0C or more while making tea, and even \u2018food grade\u2019 plastics can break down or...[Content truncated]",

Here\u2019s our process.\nHealthline only shows you brands and products that we stand behind.\nGreen tea may help support cognition, maintenance of moderate weight, and offer some protection against cancer.\nGreen tea is touted to be one of the healthiest beverages on the planet that could have many potential health benefits.\nHere are 10 possible health benefits of green tea.\nGreen tea contains a type of polyphenol called a catechin. Catechins are antioxidants that help prevent cell damage and provide other health benefits.\nThe most well-known and abundant catechin in green tea is epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which research has found may be involved in improving various health conditions or markers of disease.\nGreen tea has polyphenol antioxidants, including a catechin called EGCG. These antioxidants could have various beneficial effects on health.\nA 2017 research paper found that drinking green tea may benefit cognition, mood, and brain function, possibly due to compounds in green tea like caffeine and L-theanine.\nA 2020 study also suggested that green tea is linked with a 64% lower chance of cognitive impairment in middle-aged and older adults. More human studies are needed to further explore this effect.\nGreen tea has functional ingredients that may combine to improve brain function and cognitive health. Green tea seems to be linked with a lower chance of cognitive impairment in middle and older age. \nA 2022 review found that the ability of green tea to positively influence your metabolism is enhanced with aerobic or resistance exercise. \nThat said, the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements suggests that while some studies do show an ability for green tea to improve how your body breaks down fat, its overall effect on weight loss is likely to be small. \nGreen tea may increase metabolic rate and increase fat burning in the short term, although not all studies agree. Green tea\u2019s ability to improve fat burning is improved when paired with exercise.\nWhile the evidence is mixed and inconsistent, research has linked drinking green tea with a reduced chance of developing some types of cancer, such as lung cancer or ovarian cancer.\nA 2020 review found that while experimental research shows a modest beneficial effect, scientists could not conclude any consistent effects of green tea on overall cancer likelihood. Additional high quality research is needed. \nThere is some evidence of a relationship between drinking green tea and less chance of certain cancers. But, much more research in humans is needed to better explore this....[Content truncated]",
