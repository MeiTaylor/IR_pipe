TeaComposition is a citizen science project introducing the Tea Bag Index (TBI) method to students in Australia to support research on soil decomposition using tea bags (green and rooibos). Soil microbial driven decomposition is an essential soil function that releases soil organic matter (SOM) and nutrients, i.e., soil ecosystem services. The TBI experiments enable citizens to understand this process (increasing soil connectivity) and this information is valuable for assessing urban soil conditions. With 430 TBI in-field incubations between 2017 and 2020, this project engaged more than 3200 students who tested the TBI method on more than 50 school grounds and collected soil samples for analyses of soil properties. Approximately 50% of the tea bags were recovered and mean TBI parameters were: decomposition rate (k) = 0.02 gd−1 and stabilisation factor (S) = 0.32. Soil texture, SOC and SI had the most significant relationships with TBI. Clay and Slaking Index (SI) had negative impacts on k (rs = -0.37, -0.22, _p_ ≤ 0.05, respectively) and SOC had a negative effect for S (rs\\=-0.27; _p_ ≤ 0.05). These results suggest a combination of high clay and SOC may be related to reduced potential for C sequestration. Regarding citizen science, this study suggests further research using a local tea brand and shorter burials. This suggestion aims to increase Australian citizen participation.\nKeywords\n--------\nCitizen science\nSoil decomposition\nTea Bag Index\nSoil connectivity\nCited by (0)\n------------\n© 2021 The University of Sydney.

(2013) \\\\], provides standardized litter decomposition data due to uniformity of the litters and bags, which is necessary for large-scale analysis of the effects of environmental factors on decomposition rates. The tea bag method uses commercially available tetra-shaped tea bags of green tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze) and rooibos tea (Aspalathus linearis (Burm. f.) R. Dahlgren), produced by Lipton, as a substitute for litters and soil organic matter. In the method, the amount of tea leaves decomposed during a 90-day incubation period is used to calculate the decomposition constant k and stabilization factor S (Tea Bag Index) \\\\]. Temporal variations in chemical composition during the decomposition process exhibited were typical of local leaf litters \\\\], indicating that tea bags can be representative of local litters. A large number of studies have used the tea bag method to assess decomposition potential \\,,,,,\\].\nHowever, it remains uncertain whether tea bag decomposition in response to wetness is representative of that of local litters. Generally, higher decomposition rates are observed in wetter conditions, but excess water inhibits decomposition: according to Prescott (2010), water contents higher than 80% (wet weight basis) suppresses litter decomposition rates. By contrast, a field experiment reported that tea bag decomposition was not suppressed, even at high water contents, based on comparison of tea bag decomposition data obtained from various study sites \\\\]. Tea leaves may have large water-leachable fractions, where the inhibitory impact of very high water content on litter decomposition may be negated by large leaching fractions under wetter conditions. If this is the case, tea bags should not be used to determine litter decomposition rates under high soil water contents. In field studies, however, other environmental factors covary with soil water content, so it remains unclear whether the effect of soil water on tea bag decomposition becomes inhibitory at higher water contents. In the present study, we performed laboratory incubation and leaching experiments to clarify the effect of water content on tea bag decomposition, and the potential contribution of leaching loss.\nTo utilize the tea bag method to test the impact of environmental changes on litter decomposition at a large scale, a practical issue must be resolved first.

The objective of this work was to highlight the importance of green tea by evaluating the antioxidant activity of the most popular green tea brands in Saudi Arabia, Lipton and Rabea. To our knowledge, no studies have so far been done to estimate the antioxidant activity of these brands. To determine the antioxidant activities of these two brands, 10 mg/ml of each brand was extracted and their total phenolic content (TPC), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity, hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity, ferric reducing power and ferrous ion chelating effect were measured. The TPC of Lipton tea was 678.7 υg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/10mg, whereas in Rabea tea, the TPC was 647.1 υg GAE/10mg. The presence study indicated that there were no significant differences in total phenolic contents and the percentage inhibition as shown in DPPH and H2O2 assays among Lipton and Rabea green teas. Moreover, it was found that all assays have exhibited high antioxidant activity in both green teas. In conclusion, our study showed evidence for evenness and stability of the antioxidant activity of the two commercial green teas available in the markets of Saudi Arabia. Continued researches are needed to further the current knowledge on the health-promoting effects of this popular beverage using different supplements by different mechanisms.\nKeywords\nGreen Tea,  Polyphenols,  Antioxidants,  Radical Scavenging Activity,  Total Phenolic Content \nShare and Cite: \nReceived 17 February 2016; accepted 14 June 2016; published 17 June 2016\n\n\n1. Introduction\nTea is the most widely consumed drink in the world after water. It has been cultivated and consumed for more than 2000 years.

There were no significant differences in biochemical analysis between the groups, which may indicate the safety of this product.

GTPs were also found to reduce significantly serum glucose levels in alloxan diabetic rats at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Continued daily administration (15 days) of the extract at 50 or 100 mg/kg produced 29% and 44% reduction, respectively, in the elevated serum glucose level produced by alloxan administration. Elevated hepatic and renal enzymes produced by alloxan were found to be reduced significantly by GTPs. The serum lipid peroxidation level was increased by alloxan and reduced significantly by the administration of 100 mg/kg of GTPs. Decreased liver glycogen resulting from alloxan administration showed a significant increase after GTP treatment. The GTP-treated group showed increased antioxidant potential, as seen from improvements in superoxide dismutase and glutathione levels. However, catalase, lipid peroxidation, and glutathione peroxidase levels were unchanged. These results indicate that alterations in the glucose utilizing system and oxidation status in rats that were increased by alloxan were partially reversed by the administration of GTPs \\\\].\nCatechins also reduced plasma triglyceride levels in an oral glucose-tolerance test in normal rats \\\\].

In conclusion, our study showed evidence for evenness and stability of the antioxidant activity of the two commercial green teas available in the markets of Saudi Arabia. Continued researches are needed to further the current knowledge on the health-promoting effects of this popular beverage using different supplements by different mechanisms.\nKeywords\nGreen Tea,  Polyphenols,  Antioxidants,  Radical Scavenging Activity,  Total Phenolic Content \nShare and Cite: \nReceived 17 February 2016; accepted 14 June 2016; published 17 June 2016\n\n\n1. Introduction\nTea is the most widely consumed drink in the world after water. It has been cultivated and consumed for more than 2000 years. Tea comes from the leaves of two classes of Camellia sinensis plant: assamica and sinensis, which originate in China and Southeast Asia [1] [2] . Tea has complex structure, which contains polyphenols, amino acids, proteins, alkaloids, minerals, carbohydrates, volatile compounds and trace elements [3]...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What scientific testing has confirmed the contents of Lipton lemon flavor green tea bags?",
        "Answer": "Scientific testing related to Lipton lemon flavor green tea bags primarily involves studies focusing on the chemical composition and antioxidant activity of Lipton green teas. One notable study compared the antioxidant activity between Lipton green tea and another popular brand, Rabea, in Saudi Arabia. It evaluated the total phenolic content and various antioxidant activities, demonstrating that Lipton green tea has a total phenolic content of 678.7 µg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per 10 mg, indicating its antioxidative properties. While these studies affirm the quality and antioxidant benefits of Lipton tea, they do not address the specific claim regarding the presence of live worms explicitly. Lipton's response to the video featuring alleged worms clarified that the items identified as worms were not actual worms but rather small pieces of the lemon flavoring used in the tea, which dissolve in hot water. This assertion was supported by local authorities, who confirmed the safety and quality of the tea bags. Thus, while there are studies confirming the contents and quality of Lipton teas, specific scientific testing directly confirming the presence of any foreign, living organisms within the tea bags has not been made public as part of the brand's quality control assurances.",
