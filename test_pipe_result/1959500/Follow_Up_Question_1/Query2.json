Twenty-five patients with different gastrointestinal pathologies were included in the study and divided into treatment and control groups. The tolerance of tableted green tea was good in the treatment group, who showed better dynamics of quality-of-life indices, especially in scales of body pain and social functioning. There were no significant differences in biochemical analysis between the groups, which may indicate the safety of this product. Analysis revealed that the treatment group showed a decreased level of all antioxidant status indices, as reflected in a significant decreasing of the lipid peroxidation index from 4.63 to 4.14.\n### Effects on carbohydrate metabolism\nType II diabetes is a heterogeneous disorder that involves resistance of glucose and lipid metabolism in peripheral tissues to the biological activity of insulin and inadequate insulin secretion by pancreatic β cells \\\\]. Animal models of diabetes are available: Zucker rats, which are genetically obese; injection of streptozotocin or alloxan, which destroys pancreatic β cells; and treatment with sucrose-rich diets, which induces obesity and insulin resistance.\nIn a study by Sabu _et al_. \\\\], administration of GTPs (500 mg/kg) to normal rats increased glucose tolerance significantly at 60 minutes. GTPs were also found to reduce significantly serum glucose levels in alloxan diabetic rats at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Continued daily administration (15 days) of the extract at 50 or 100 mg/kg produced 29% and 44% reduction, respectively, in the elevated serum glucose level produced by alloxan administration. Elevated hepatic and renal enzymes produced by alloxan were found to be reduced significantly by GTPs. The serum lipid peroxidation level was increased by alloxan and reduced significantly by the administration of 100 mg/kg of GTPs. Decreased liver glycogen resulting from alloxan administration showed a significant increase after GTP treatment. The GTP-treated group showed increased antioxidant potential, as seen from improvements in superoxide dismutase and glutathione levels. However, catalase, lipid peroxidation, and glutathione peroxidase levels were unchanged. These results indicate that alterations in the glucose utilizing system and oxidation status in rats that were increased by alloxan were partially reversed by the administration of GTPs \\\\].\nCatechins also reduced plasma triglyceride levels in an oral glucose-tolerance test in normal rats \\\\]. Green tea extract intake reduced these values in both Zucker rats and rats fed a sucrose-rich diet \\,\\]. Several human- and animal-based studies suggested that green...[Content truncated]",

The presence study indicated that there were no significant differences in total phenolic contents and the percentage inhibition as shown in DPPH and H2O2 assays among Lipton and Rabea green teas. Moreover, it was found that all assays have exhibited high antioxidant activity in both green teas. In conclusion, our study showed evidence for evenness and stability of the antioxidant activity of the two commercial green teas available in the markets of Saudi Arabia. Continued researches are needed to further the current knowledge on the health-promoting effects of this popular beverage using different supplements by different mechanisms.\nKeywords\nGreen Tea,  Polyphenols,  Antioxidants,  Radical Scavenging Activity,  Total Phenolic Content \nShare and Cite: \nReceived 17 February 2016; accepted 14 June 2016; published 17 June 2016\n\n\n1. Introduction\nTea is the most widely consumed drink in the world after water. It has been cultivated and consumed for more than 2000 years. Tea comes from the leaves of two classes of Camellia sinensis plant: assamica and sinensis, which originate in China and Southeast Asia [1] [2] . Tea has complex structure, which contains polyphenols, amino acids, proteins, alkaloids, minerals, carbohydrates, volatile compounds and trace elements [3]...[Content truncated]",

Really I do. I’m not a picky guy. I’m certainly not a snob. I love a five-course meal at a five-star restaurant, but I also must confess a fondness for a “Snag Burger” at the bar down the street from my shop. I love a good Indian buffet, a medium-rare steak, authentic London fish and chips, and an authentic Inverness haggis with neeps & tatties. Basically, if the chef cares about how the food tastes, I’m probably going to enjoy it. And if your servers care about serving the customers, I’m probably going to enjoy being in your restaurant. I love eating out.\nBut we’ve really got to talk about your tea.\nTo many people, having the right wine to go with their dinner transforms a good meal into a great one. Coffee drinkers will greatly appreciate fresh-brewed coffee, and beer aficionados will be greatly disappointed it you offer nothing but bland “megabrews” like Bud and Coors.\nThose of us that love our tea feel exactly the same way. I’ve had some wonderful meals in restaurants and gone home disappointed because I got some bitter, oversteeped Lipton tea from a teabag instead of the restaurant putting in just a wee bit of effort and providing a good cup.\nI’m not a , telling you and your other patrons the one and only way to make a proper cup of tea. Most of what I’m asking for is a proper selection and giving us the option to steep it as we wish.\n### #1: Tell us (or show us) the options!\nFirst, if your restaurant is even half a notch above fast food, you have more than one type of tea, right? It may be  from the factory floor in a Lipton teabag, but you’ll have a black tea, a green tea, something without caffeine, and either  or Moroccan Mint. If you don’t offer at least those four, you’d might as well hang a sign that says, “Tea Drinkers Not Welcome.”\nSo let’s start with that. When we order a cup of hot tea, either ask what kind we want, or present us with a basket or box containing a selection to choose from. Don’t just bring out a cup of black tea and then let us find out later that you had other options.\n### #2: Hot water. Really hot water.\nNext, don’t grab the water until you’re...[Content truncated]",

The authors’ assumption that the fluoride variability would be lower in processed beverages and foods than that of municipal water was made based on existing data and the results of the water pilot study (Miller-Ihli et al ., 2003), and hence fewer samples. The procurement and sample preparation of the foods and beverages that are the chief contributors of fluoride were handled through NFNAP supervised contracts and agreements. Sample units were purchased at retail sites, following detailed instruction from NDL. Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Food Analysis Laboratory Control Center (FALCC) handled sample preparation. A quality control (QC) oversight program was established by the NFDIAS Laboratory Methods/Quality Control Working Group with representation from NDL, the University of Iowa, and FALCC. NFDIAS quality control materials were prepared by the USDA, Food Composition Laboratory (FCL) and by the NDL and characterized by three cooperating laboratories. The University of Iowa, College of Dentistry, conducted the laboratory analysis of fluoride. Samples were analyzed using a fluoride ion-specific electrode direct read method for clear liquids and a micro-diffusion method for other food samples. The direct reading method was validated using Certified Reference Material (National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2671a, Fluoride in Freeze-Dried Urine) and by a comparison of results for several beverage samples between University of Iowa and FCL (Patterson et al ., 2004). The micro-diffusion method was validated by analysis of a Certified Reference Material (National Research Centre for Certified Reference Materials, Beijing, China, GBW 08572 Prawns) and other reference materials that have reference values for the fluoride content (for example: NIST, SRM 8436), prior to sample analysis. Methodological procedures for analyzing carbonated beverages were developed at the University of Iowa and presented at the March 2004 International Association for Dental Research (IADR) Meeting (Heilman et al ., 2004). Values in the database are reported on a 100 gram and on a ppm basis on the edible portion of a food. For some foods, no standard error was available from the literature source. Much of the literature data as well as the analytical data reported by the University of Iowa were reported on a ppm basis. Specific gravities needed for fluoride data conversion and migrations were obtained from VPI. Specific gravities for literature data were based on the specific gravities obtained...[Content truncated]",
