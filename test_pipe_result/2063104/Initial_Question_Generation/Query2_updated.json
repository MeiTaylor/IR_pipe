Mr. Obama declined to comment specifically on the efforts by the F.B.I. to require Apple\u2019s help in gaining data from an iPhone used by one of the terrorists in the December attack in San Bernardino, Calif.\nBut the president warned that America had already accepted that law enforcement can \u201crifle through your underwear\u201d in searches for those suspected of preying on children, and he said there was no reason that a person\u2019s digital information should be treated differently.\n\u201cIf, technologically, it is possible to make an impenetrable device or system, where the encryption is so strong that there is no key, there is no door at all, then how do we apprehend the child pornographer?\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cHow do we disrupt a terrorist plot?\u201d\nIf the government has no way into a smartphone, he added, \u201cthen everyone is walking around with a Swiss bank account in your pocket.\u201d\nMr. Obama\u2019s decision to embrace the law enforcement position on encryption represents a fundamental break with a tech community that has strongly supported his political career. For years, the president nurtured close ties to Silicon Valley, tapping the youthful talent there to help him reshape the federal government\u2019s aging technology infrastructure and seeking out leading executives for private advice and millions in campaign cash.\n* * *\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Texas, on Friday. **Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images** ****hide caption****\n****toggle caption****\nMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n  !\nPresident Obama speaks during the South by Southwest Interactive conference in Austin, Texas, on Friday.\nMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\nIn his wide-ranging keynote interview at South by Southwest, the music, film and tech festival in Austin, Texas, President Obama focused on technology's role in civic life.\nObama, who was interviewed by Evan Smith, editor of the _Texas Tribune,_ cited low voter turnout as an area in which technology could improve citizens' participation in government. He said it was \"easier to order a pizza than to vote\" and said we need to think about how to \"redesign our systems so that we don't have 50 percent or 55 percent voter participation in presidential elections.\"\nCalling on government and private companies to work together, Obama said it's vital to \"create systems that make government more responsive and make it work better.\"\nWhen asked about people who are ideologically anti-government, the president pointed to the collective good, saying someone checking the weather on a smart phone is benefiting from government services.\n\"When government does great things, we take it for granted and it's not a story,\" he said, citing roads, geosatellite systems, armed forces and other public benefits as evidence.\nSmith also asked Obama about the \"massive digital divide\" in the U.S., pointing to the fact that minorities have significantly less access to the Internet, which makes it more difficult for them to be engaged citizens or even do their homework.\nObama responded by describing a program called the Opportunity Network, which installs Wi-Fi in low-income housing and rural areas. He acknowledged that this was only part of the answer, saying \"I'm trying to solve every problem.\"\nBut, Obama said, solving problems requires cooperation.

President and Mrs. Obama\u2019s visit here will inspire attendees to that purpose.\u201d\nUnfortunately, the president\u2019s speech happens on the same day as a panel near and dear to the first lady\u2019s health-conscious interests\u2014. Luckily SXSW features   panels.\nThe tech festival has become a go-to for  and . No word if the Obamas will stick around for , or if someone will disrupt the \nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser will also be in attendance.\nYou haven't listened to any stories!\nWhat's the hold up?\nWAMU stopped publishing DCist.com in February 2024. You are viewing the site archive.",

The group has been present at SXSW for the last three years and said the commander-in-chief\u2019s high-profile appearance did not play a role in their planning this year.\n\u201cThe fact that President Obama is going to be in Austin at the same time changes nothing. We won\u2019t be deterred or barred from exercising our liberties,\u201d Open Carry Texas wrote on Facebook. \u201cIn fact, if Obama sees us, we look forward to him approaching us, shaking our hands, and thanking us for exercising our rights in a safe and legal manner in the way he is tasked with supporting and defending.\u201d\nThe group said it doesn\u2019t have a rally or march planned, and that their teams would be limited to up to 10 people at the South entrance to the Capitol. Still, their planned presence has sparked outrage among anti-gun groups, including Moms Demand Action, which is planning a counter-protest.\nThe Secret Service said in a statement that it\u2019s aware of the demonstration. \u201cThe Secret Service works closely with our local law enforcement partners in each state to ensure a safe environment for our and the public,\u201d agency spokesman Robert Hoback said in a statement. \u201cIndividuals determined to be carrying firearms will not be allowed past a predetermined outer perimeter checkpoint, regardless of whether they possess a ticket to the event.\u201d\nSXSW attendees are prohibited from carrying weapons of any kind, including concealed or displayed firearms, according to the festival\u2019s website.\nContact us at letters@time.com",
