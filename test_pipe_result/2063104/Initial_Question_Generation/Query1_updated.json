It\u2019s likely that Taylor\u2019s wife, Peggy, and\u00a0John Quincy Adams\u2019s spouse, Louisa Adams, also attended her funeral.\u00a0But while Madison\u2019s death garnered attention, it didn\u2019t take on the quasi-state funeral air of later years.\n(No first lady has ever been given an official state funeral. They\u2019re generally accorded the same courtesies as military family members at Arlington National Cemetery, meaning family can request\u00a0military body bearers and a military chaplain, according to the Defense Department.)\n\u2018One last time\u2019: Barbara Bush had already faced a death more painful than her own\nFirst lady Julia Grant, wife of Ulysses S.
