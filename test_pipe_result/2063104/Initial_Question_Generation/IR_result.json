He said it was \"easier to order a pizza than to vote\" and said we need to think about how to \"redesign our systems so that we don't have 50 percent or 55 percent voter participation in presidential elections.\"\nCalling on government and private companies to work together, Obama said it's vital to \"create systems that make government more responsive and make it work better.\"\nWhen asked about people who are ideologically anti-government, the president pointed to the collective good, saying someone checking the weather on a smart phone is benefiting from government services.\n\"When government does great things, we take it for granted and it's not a story,\" he said, citing roads, geosatellite systems, armed forces and other public benefits as evidence.\nSmith also asked Obama about the \"massive digital divide\" in the U.S., pointing to the fact that minorities have significantly less access to the Internet, which makes it more difficult for them to be engaged citizens or even do their homework.\nObama responded by describing a program called the Opportunity Network, which installs Wi-Fi in low-income housing and rural areas. He acknowledged that this was only part of the answer, saying \"I'm trying to solve every problem.\"\nBut, Obama said, solving problems requires cooperation. He said the country needs to re-imagine the relationship between government and the private sector \"so that we use technology data, social media in order to join forces around problems.\"\nIf the U.S. does that, he said, \"there's no problem that we face in this country that's not solvable.\"\nAt the end of the interview, when asked about the ongoing legal battle between Apple and the FBI over accessing data on the iPhone of the San Bernardino shooters, Obama declined to comment specifically, but urged against \"absolutist\" views on either side of the issue.\nThe president said that while there must be some concessions to personal privacy (he cited airport security as one such existing concession) he said he was \"way on the civil liberties side\" of the debate.

It's the first time in the festival's 30-year history that a sitting president and first lady have participated.\nMichelle Obama will be at the former first lady's funeral, which  at the Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. But White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest confirmed Tuesday that President Obama won't be there.\n\"The president will not attend,\" he said at the daily White House briefing. \"The president is traveling in Texas.\"\nReagan, 94, died Saturday of congestive heart failure.

Not since John F. Kennedy attended the funeral of Eleanor Roosevelt in 1962 has a sitting president attended the service of a late first lady. Michelle Obama also attended the 2011 funeral of Betty Ford, and the president did not.\n“He is sending his contempt for the Reagan presidency, his hostility to the Reagan ideology, and he is once again proving that he has never been president of all of the American people. He is president of his faction,” Gingrich said, adding that he would be attending Reagan’s service on Friday in California with his wife, Callista. “He does not do any of the ceremonial duties that the president of the American people would do, and it’s why he is the most destructive and most divisive president, I think, since James Buchanan in the 1850s.”\nGingrich also blasted Obama as “the man who refused to attend the funeral of a sitting Supreme Court justice because he...[Content truncated]"

Nor does it matter that Obama is following the examples set by his modern predecessors whose time in office coincides with the instant transmission of news and the arrival of air travel, or that then-President George W. Bush didn’t attend fellow Texan Lady Bird Johnson’s funeral in 2007 (and no one raised a fuss).\nNo, none of it matters.

        "Question": "Did President Obama attend Nancy Reagan's funeral or the South by Southwest festival?",
        "Answer": "President Obama did not attend Nancy Reagan's funeral; instead, he attended the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas. This decision was confirmed by White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, who stated, \"The president will not attend\" the funeral as he was traveling in Texas for the festival where he was scheduled to speak. While First Lady Michelle Obama did attend Nancy Reagan's funeral, President Obama chose to focus on the SXSW event, where he aimed to engage with innovative thinkers and gather ideas to modernize government processes. This choice sparked criticism from some, including Newt Gingrich, who interpreted it as a sign of contempt for the Reagan legacy and an inappropriate absence for a sitting president at such a significant memorial. Overall, it is clear from various reports that Obama opted for the festival over attending the funeral, which aligns with the typical behavior of sitting presidents, as attending funerals of former first ladies has not been a common practice historically.",
