Experimenting on McDonald's products to show how indestructible and indigestible they are , but in this case, you can blame science, not the burger, for these puzzling results.\n shows that as soon as the molten copper makes contact with the burger bun, it starts to ball up and roll off the surface.\nAnd while the top of the bun is well and truly burnt by the end of it, we're shown that the rest of the burger underneath is completely fine - the molten copper didn't get even close to melting through the surface of the bread. Buns of steel!\nWe also see a similar effect on the burger patty when it's directly exposed to the molten copper, and just so you know, that copper is heated to around 1,093 degrees Celsius (2,000 degrees Fahrenheit).\nPretty nuts, right? Well no, not at all, if you know your basic physics.\n, the video footage is real, but the implications that Big Macs are bad specifically because they don't melt from molten copper exposure are false. \"In fact, the results showcased in this video (just like experiments with seemingly non-rotting hamburgers) could likely be replicated with any burger (or similar food item), regardless of brand,\" \nThe phenomenon that's being demonstrated here isn't terrible food, it's the , which we last saw in  of molten salt being added to water.\nYou can also see the Leidenfrost effect in action , where molten copper is poured into water, , where it forces water into an amazing star shape on a hot surface.\nThe Leidenfrost effect is defined in physics as when a liquid comes in contact with a mass that's significantly hotter than its boiling point, and produces an insulating vapour layer that protects the liquid from boiling and evaporating away immediately.\nYou've probably seen it in cooking when you get drops of water on a really hot pan - the water balls up and skids across the surface, protected by a layer of water vapour.\nSo in the case of the Big Mac, some of the moisture in the burger bun boils when it comes into contact with the molten copper, and this produces a strong, insulating layer that initially protects it.\n, the guys from Mythbusters demonstrated this effect in 2009 by showing that you could dip your hand into molten lead without getting burned:\nwidth=\"700\u2033 height=\"414\u2033 allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" seamless=\"seamless\">\nStill though, do _not_...[Content truncated]",

It explains the Leidenfrost effect observed when molten copper is poured over the Big Mac, clarifying that the 'indestructibility' of the burger is a result of physical principles rather than properties of the food itself.

Problem is, it didn't change much. Sure, the burger shrank some, and the fries look a little shriveled, but **no mold, no sign of decay**. McDonald's  saying they couldn't respond to the project because they were unsure what condition the burger and fries were kept in; we suppose they're alluding to the possibility that they were frozen? Or stored in the vacuum that is outer space? Watch the video below and decide for yourself.\n**Video: Happy Meal Mold-Free After Six Months**\n\u00b7  \\  \n\u00b7  \\  \n\u00b7  \\\nMore From Eater\n---------------\nSign up for the Sign up for Eater's newsletter\n----------------------------------------------\nThe freshest news from the food world every day\n#### Thanks for signing up!\nCheck your inbox for a welcome email.\nEmail **(required)**\nOops.

But according to a recent investigation by Consumer Reports, they\u2019re very much there \u2014 as well as in your salad bowl, fry bag and sandwich wrap.\nSo what are these virtually indestructible compounds, created in a lab in 1938 by a 27-year-old chemist? And how worried do you need to be about them?\nThis is what you should know about PFAS.\nAs one researcher put it: \u201ceverywhere.\u201d\nPFAS are in your shampoo bottle, your stain-resistant couch, your dental floss, your bicycle lubricant. And when these multipurpose compounds are used in food packaging, they have a way of transferring to the food itself. To say that PFAS are difficult to avoid is an understatement.\nAlthough these substances have been in use for eight decades, regulators have only recently acquired the scientific understanding and technical capacity needed to test for them at the very low concentrations \u2014 measured in parts per trillion \u2014 at which they\u2019re present in food, according to the Food and Drug Administration.\nIn light of those advances, the F.D.A. recommends not reading too much into the fact that a given product might have \u201cdetectable\u201d levels of the chemicals. \u201cEven when there have been detectable levels of PFAS,\u201d the agency said, \u201cour safety assessments have shown no cause for avoiding these foods.\u201d\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

They deal with this by giving them corrective doses of antibiotics and certain steroids that keep them gaining rather than losing muscle. Then they\u2019re quick-slaughtered, parted out in as sanitary a set of conditions as they can achieve for the price (because rotting meat cannot be sold) and then super-fast frozen. They\u2019re thawed just enough to complete the removal of meat from bones, and turned into various forms of ground beef, still at very low temperature. Then, the burgers themselves are formed and frozen. The temperatures at which they\u2019re frozen and packed and kept will stun or kill most decay bacteria.\nThen, they\u2019re transported in refrigerated trucks to the individual franchised stores. There, they defrost them enough to be cooked, and when they do cook them, it\u2019s quick but complete. There is no such thing as a rare McBurger. Any excess water that hasn\u2019t been freeze-dried off the outside, is sweated out during the process of cooking the meat to well-done.\nNote that the cooks all have to meet sanitary requirements, so as not to contaminate the burgers.  \nThey then put them on their various vessels of bread with oily sauces, vegetables, and oh yes the tomatoes are kept from touching the meat. They\u2019re placed in their final resting boxes and kept under heat lamps.\nThey\u2019re kept at the legally mandated holding temperature, and if they aren\u2019t sold within an hour or two they are thrown away. Discarded. This is because (1) they taste unhappy and we can\u2019t have that in any happy meal, and (2) they might grow bacteria.\nOnce delivered into the hands of their customers, it\u2019s expected that they will be eaten within a few minutes. An hour at most. So they\u2019ll still be edible and taste exactly like a McBurger.\nBack in college, my then-future wife made a movie for a class she needed \u2026 and it involved googly eyes attached to fast food and was shot with an 8mm camera.\nThe story of an ordinary McDonalds burger which became aware of its existence, and became Cosmically McWare (1).

Without sufficient moisture \u2013 either in the food itself or the environment \u2013 bacteria and mold may not grow and therefore, decomposition is unlikely. So if food is or becomes dry enough, it is unlikely to grow mold or bacteria or decompose.\u00a0 Food prepared at home that is left to dehydrate could see similar results. Look closely, the burgers you are seeing are likely dried out and dehydrated, and by no means \u201cthe same as the day they were purchased.\u201d\nThe reality is that our burgers are made only with 100% USDA inspected beef. There are  and the only thing ever added is a touch of salt and pepper on the grill.\nLatest Stories\n--------------\n* * *\n*   Our Company\n    -----------\n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n*   Our Purpose & Impact\n    --------------------\n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n*   Investors\n    ---------\n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n*   All Stories\n    -----------\n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n*   Franchising Overview\n    --------------------\n    *   \n    *   \n*   Contact\n    -------\n    *   \n    *   \nOur Company\n-----------\n*   \n*   \n*   \nOur Purpose & Impact\n--------------------\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*...[Content truncated]",
