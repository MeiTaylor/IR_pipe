Without sufficient moisture – either in the food itself or the environment – bacteria and mold may not grow and therefore, decomposition is unlikely. So if food is or becomes dry enough, it is unlikely to grow mold or bacteria or decompose.  Food prepared at home that is left to dehydrate could see similar results. Look closely, the burgers you are seeing are likely dried out and dehydrated, and by no means “the same as the day they were purchased.”\nThe reality is that our burgers are made only with 100% USDA inspected beef. There are  and the only thing ever added is a touch of salt and pepper on the grill.\nLatest Stories\n--------------\n* * *\n*   Our Company\n    -----------\n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n*   Our Purpose & Impact\n    --------------------\n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n*   Investors\n    ---------\n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n*   All Stories\n    -----------\n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n*   Franchising Overview\n    --------------------\n    *   \n    *   \n*   Contact\n    -------\n    *   \n    *   \nOur Company\n-----------\n*   \n*   \n*   \nOur Purpose & Impact\n--------------------\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*...[Content truncated]",

But according to a recent investigation by Consumer Reports, they’re very much there — as well as in your salad bowl, fry bag and sandwich wrap.\nSo what are these virtually indestructible compounds, created in a lab in 1938 by a 27-year-old chemist? And how worried do you need to be about them?\nThis is what you should know about PFAS.\nAs one researcher put it: “everywhere.”\nPFAS are in your shampoo bottle, your stain-resistant couch, your dental floss, your bicycle lubricant. And when these multipurpose compounds are used in food packaging, they have a way of transferring to the food itself. To say that PFAS are difficult to avoid is an understatement.\nAlthough these substances have been in use for eight decades, regulators have only recently acquired the scientific understanding and technical capacity needed to test for them at the very low concentrations — measured in parts per trillion — at which they’re present in food, according to the Food and Drug Administration.\nIn light of those advances, the F.D.A. recommends not reading too much into the fact that a given product might have “detectable” levels of the chemicals. “Even when there have been detectable levels of PFAS,” the agency said, “our safety assessments have shown no cause for avoiding these foods.”\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Our brains have been wired to prefer high-calorie foods (sorry, dieters) and the Big Mac provides these calories in abundance - an average Big Mac contains 540 calories, which cause our blood sugar level to shoot up. Feel-good chemicals, like the neurotransmitter dopamine, are released into the brain, and you may catch yourself thinking: \"This is a tasty burger.\"\nIt's from the 20-30 minute point that the downhill slide starts. The high levels of fructose corn syrup and sodium inside the bun leave us  (and in the long term, this can lead to obesity, , and heart disease). Then the sodium - some 970 milligrams of it - causes dehydration and starts making the kidneys and heart work faster.

Without sufficient moisture – either in the food itself or the environment – bacteria and mold may not grow and therefore, decomposition is unlikely. So if food is or becomes dry enough, it is unlikely to grow mold or bacteria or decompose.  Food prepared at home that is left to dehydrate could see similar results. Look closely, the burgers you are seeing are likely dried out and dehydrated, and by no means “the same as the day they were purchased.”\nThe reality is that our burgers are made only with 100% USDA inspected beef. There are  and the only thing ever added is a touch of salt and pepper on the grill.\nLatest Stories\n--------------\n* * *\n*   Our Company\n    -----------\n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n*   Our Purpose & Impact\n    --------------------\n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n*   Investors\n    ---------\n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n*   All Stories\n    -----------\n    *   \n    *   \n    *   \n*   Franchising Overview\n    --------------------\n    *   \n    *   \n*   Contact\n    -------\n    *   \n    *   \nOur Company\n-----------\n*   \n*   \n*   \nOur Purpose & Impact\n--------------------\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*...[Content truncated]"

Over at comparison site, , there's a detailed infographic that shows the effect of eating one of the most iconic on-the-go meals of all time: the McDonald's Big Mac.\nFor the first 10 minutes, everything goes brilliantly, at least on the surface. Our brains have been wired to prefer high-calorie foods (sorry, dieters) and the Big Mac provides these calories in abundance - an average Big Mac contains 540 calories, which cause our blood sugar level to shoot up. Feel-good chemicals, like the neurotransmitter dopamine, are released into the brain, and you may catch yourself thinking: \"This is a tasty burger.\"\nIt's from the 20-30 minute point that the downhill slide starts. The high levels of fructose corn syrup and sodium inside the bun leave us  (and in the long term, this can lead to obesity, , and heart disease). Then the sodium - some 970 milligrams of it - causes dehydration and starts making the kidneys and heart work faster. Blood pressure rises, and you may well be tempted by a McFlurry or apple pie.\n, at the 40 minute mark, the body will probably still be craving similar types of food: losing control of your blood sugar...[Content truncated]"

    "QA": {
        "Question": "Does the video evidence support the claim that McDonald's food is indestructible and indigestible?",
        "Answer": "The video evidence does not support the claim that McDonald's food is indestructible and indigestible. While the video shows molten copper being poured onto a Big Mac and suggests that its structure remains unaffected by the extreme heat, this observation is primarily due to a scientific phenomenon known as the Leidenfrost effect. This effect occurs when a liquid encounters a surface that is significantly hotter than its boiling point, creating a protective vapor layer that prevents the liquid from making direct contact with the surface beneath it. As such, the molten copper rolled off the burger bun instead of penetrating it. Furthermore, the claim that McDonald's food is indigestible is misleading. All food, including McDonald's products, is digestible under normal conditions, and any assertions to the contrary can be attributed to misunderstandings of food preservation and decomposition. It has been documented that McDonald's burgers, like other types of food, can decompose when adequate moisture is present. The lack of decomposition in some cases can be explained by environmental conditions, such as low humidity, rather than indicating that the food is indestructible. Thus, the evidence presented in the video and supporting articles demonstrates that while the Big Mac may resist melting under extreme conditions due to physical principles, it does not render the food indestructible or indigestible in a nutritional sense. Therefore, the claim is not substantiated by scientific understanding and evidence.",
