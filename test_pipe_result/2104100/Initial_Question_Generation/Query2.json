The average time for food to completely pass through the human digestive system is 24-72 hours, depending on the individual and the specific food consumed.

Over at comparison site, , there's a detailed infographic that shows the effect of eating one of the most iconic on-the-go meals of all time: the McDonald's Big Mac.\nFor the first 10 minutes, everything goes brilliantly, at least on the surface. Our brains have been wired to prefer high-calorie foods (sorry, dieters) and the Big Mac provides these calories in abundance - an average Big Mac contains 540 calories, which cause our blood sugar level to shoot up. Feel-good chemicals, like the neurotransmitter dopamine, are released into the brain, and you may catch yourself thinking: \"This is a tasty burger.\"\nIt's from the 20-30 minute point that the downhill slide starts. The high levels of fructose corn syrup and sodium inside the bun leave us  (and in the long term, this can lead to obesity, , and heart disease). Then the sodium - some 970 milligrams of it - causes dehydration and starts making the kidneys and heart work faster. Blood pressure rises, and you may well be tempted by a McFlurry or apple pie.\n, at the 40 minute mark, the body will probably still be craving similar types of food: losing control of your blood sugar...[Content truncated]",

To guide us through all the physiological changes that take place the moment you put that burger or milkshake in your mouth, we assembled a team of nutrition experts to explain what exactly happens whenever you bite into that  or dig into a McFlurry.\nWhether you grab a supersized meal at McDonald's every day or just drop by occasionally, expect to see these effects when you eat Mcdonald's regularly, and for healthier meal options, check out our list of .\nDigestion problems\n------------------\n!\nMoab Republic/Shutterstock\nAnyone who loves to eat McDonald's has probably noticed that after their meal, it's so much harder to keep going with your day and everything feels so much heavier. Don't take this feeling for granted—your body faces some  when it tries to process all of the food you just took in.\n\"Fat is the slowest digested macronutrient,\" says . \"Foods with a high-fat content slow stomach emptying. This means they spend more time in your stomach which can result in bloating, nausea, and stomach aches. You may experience these symptoms within a 24-hour window after consuming a hamburger or milkshake, especially if you consume multiple high-fat items together. That may make you re-think the infamous question, 'Do you want fries and a shake with that?'\"\nTo learn which items can do the most serious damage, check out .\nHeart-rate spikes\n-----------------\n!\n8th.creator/Shutterstock\n has some very noticeable immediate effects, and if you can't go to McDonald's without grabbing a McFlurry or soda, expect to encounter spikes in your heart rate.\n\"Drinks such as milkshakes, soda, tea, lemonade, and coffee drinks all have ,\" says Gregg. \"The body converts sugar into glucose within minutes after consuming.

It goes without saying that, although tasty, the Big Mac is not the healthiest food option. And now, a new infographic claims to show exactly what this world-famous sandwich does to our body within an hour of eating it.\n A Big Mac contains 540 calories and 25 grams of fat. Consuming this sandwich alone – without the fries and soda that often accompany it – makes up more than 25% of an adult’s daily recommended calorie intake and over 40% of the recommended daily fat intake. \n The sandwich also contains 940 milligrams of salt – the majority of the 1,500 mg daily salt intake recommended by the American Heart Association. \n While most of us are aware that eating this sandwich is unlikely to be good for us, the nutritional values of food are often put to one side in favor of taste and convenience; around 50 million Americans each day visit fast food restaurants, with more than a fifth indulging in fast food twice weekly. \n But would you be deterred from opting for such foods if you knew what they did to your body after consumption? \n The website Fast Food Menu Price has created an infographic claiming to show how a Big Mac affects the body 10, 20, 30, 40 and 60 minutes after eating it. \n Within 10 minutes of eating a Big Mac, the high calorie content begins to increase blood sugar levels to abnormal levels, according to the infographic.

This was popularly attributed to the toxic mix of carbs and fat plus the added chemicals and preservatives in junk foods. But could there be another explanation?\nWe may have forgotten others who really don’t enjoy fast food. These are the poor creatures that live in the dark in our guts. These are the hundred trillion microbes that outnumber our total human cells ten to one and digest our food, provide many vitamins and nutrients and keep us healthy. Until recently we have viewed them as harmful—but those (like salmonella) are a tiny minority and most are essential for us.\nStudies in lab mice have shown that when fed an intensive high fat diet their microbes change dramatically and for the worse. This can be partly prevented by using probiotics; but there are obvious differences between us and lab mice, as well as our natural microbes.\nA recent study took a group of Africans who ate a traditional local diet high in beans and vegetables and swapped their diet with a group of African Americans who ate a diet high in fat and animal proteins and low dietary fibre. The Africans fared worse on American-style food: their metabolism changed to a diabetic and unhealthy profile within just two weeks. The African Americans instead had lower markers for colon cancer risk. Tests of both groups showed very different microbiomes, the populations of microbes in their guts.\nSur...[Content truncated]",

However, this is only part of the consideration of whether it is healthy or not.\nFast food is typically poor in terms of nutrition. According to a 2015 review, fast food tends to contain various substances that are generally unhealthy. It is high in sugar, salt, saturated or trans fats, and many processed preservatives and ingredients. It also lacks some beneficial nutrients.\nHowever, not all fast food has negative impacts, and a person can make an informed choice by researching the nutritional content of particular fast food items. People can find this information on the websites of most major restaurants.\nThat said, even the more healthy fast food items are generally high in sugar, salt, saturated fats, and trans fats. The Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion notes that the typical person in the United States consumes too much of these food components.\nFast food is typically high in sugar, salt, and saturated or trans fats.

People are (understandably!) concerned about what’s in their food, especially coming from franchises that churn out massive amounts of it for what might seem like suspiciously low prices. So when rumors about what’s in that food, or what the companies that make it might cover up, begin to circulate, people tend to eat them up (so to speak). Some of these rumors might seem absolutely ridiculous on paper. But considering its history, filled with , , and , there are plenty of people that wouldn’t put anything past McDonald’s.

This was a quintessential example of the Internet running absolutely wild with a disturbing food-origin story. Pink slime actually _is_ real—it’s what happens when meat is “mechanically processed,” removing all of the edible parts from the bones so that less goes to waste, and then (sometimes) treated with anti-microbial ammonia. But McDonald’s doesn’t use it. “The \\ photo is not a representation of how we create our Chicken McNuggets®, or for that matter, any item on our menu,”  reads. However, it’s a bit more complicated than that. McDonald’s disavowal of “pink slime” is fairly recent, and they only stopped using mechanically processed beef . McNuggets, in turn, have been made with all white meat since 2003.\n3 / 12\n  !\nScott Olson/Getty Images\nThey once made a sandwich with seaweed in it\n--------------------------------------------\n**True!** Anyone who frequented McDonald’s in the early 1990s might remember the “McLean Deluxe,” a rather lackluster attempt at a health-food option.
