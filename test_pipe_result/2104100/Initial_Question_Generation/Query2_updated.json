Over at comparison site, , there's a detailed infographic that shows the effect of eating one of the most iconic on-the-go meals of all time: the McDonald's Big Mac.\nFor the first 10 minutes, everything goes brilliantly, at least on the surface. Our brains have been wired to prefer high-calorie foods (sorry, dieters) and the Big Mac provides these calories in abundance - an average Big Mac contains 540 calories, which cause our blood sugar level to shoot up. Feel-good chemicals, like the neurotransmitter dopamine, are released into the brain, and you may catch yourself thinking: \"This is a tasty burger.\"\nIt's from the 20-30 minute point that the downhill slide starts. The high levels of fructose corn syrup and sodium inside the bun leave us  (and in the long term, this can lead to obesity, , and heart disease). Then the sodium - some 970 milligrams of it - causes dehydration and starts making the kidneys and heart work faster. Blood pressure rises, and you may well be tempted by a McFlurry or apple pie.\n, at the 40 minute mark, the body will probably still be craving similar types of food: losing control of your blood sugar...[Content truncated]",

It goes without saying that, although tasty, the Big Mac is not the healthiest food option. And now, a new infographic claims to show exactly what this world-famous sandwich does to our body within an hour of eating it.\n A Big Mac contains 540 calories and 25 grams of fat. Consuming this sandwich alone \u2013 without the fries and soda that often accompany it \u2013 makes up more than 25% of an adult\u2019s daily recommended calorie intake and over 40% of the recommended daily fat intake. \n The sandwich also contains 940 milligrams of salt \u2013 the majority of the 1,500 mg daily salt intake recommended by the American Heart Association. \n While most of us are aware that eating this sandwich is unlikely to be good for us, the nutritional values of food are often put to one side in favor of taste and convenience; around 50 million Americans each day visit fast food restaurants, with more than a fifth indulging in fast food twice weekly. \n But would you be deterred from opting for such foods if you knew what they did to your body after consumption? \n The website Fast Food Menu Price has created an infographic claiming to show how a Big Mac affects the body 10, 20, 30, 40 and 60 minutes after eating it. \n Within 10 minutes of eating a Big Mac, the high calorie content begins to increase blood sugar levels to abnormal levels, according to the infographic.

This was popularly attributed to the toxic mix of carbs and fat plus the added chemicals and preservatives in junk foods. But could there be another explanation?\nWe may have forgotten others who really don\u2019t enjoy fast food. These are the poor creatures that live in the dark in our guts. These are the hundred trillion microbes that outnumber our total human cells ten to one and digest our food, provide many vitamins and nutrients and keep us healthy. Until recently we have viewed them as harmful\u2014but those (like salmonella) are a tiny minority and most are essential for us.\nStudies in lab mice\u00a0have shown\u00a0that when fed an intensive high fat diet their microbes change dramatically and for the worse. This can be partly prevented by using probiotics; but there are obvious differences between us and lab mice, as well as our natural microbes.\nA\u00a0recent study\u00a0took a group of Africans who ate a traditional local diet high in beans and vegetables and swapped their diet with a group of African Americans who ate a diet high in fat and animal proteins and low dietary fibre. The Africans fared worse on American-style food: their metabolism changed to a diabetic and unhealthy profile within just two weeks. The African Americans instead had lower markers for colon cancer risk. Tests of both groups showed very different microbiomes, the populations of microbes in their guts.\nSur...[Content truncated]",
