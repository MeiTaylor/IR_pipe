The campaign decided to postpone the event, and there were more scuffles.\nWhat Mr Trump said: Mr Trump told MSNBC, external that he cancelled the rally because he \"didn't want to see anybody get hurt\". \nHe later told CNN, external that he had no regrets about his rallies, describing the protesters as \"bad dudes\". \"They were rough, tough guys,\" he added.\nWhat happened: Protesters repeatedly interrupted Mr Trump's speech at a rally in Missouri. More than 30 people were arrested. \nWhat Mr Trump said: \"They're allowed to get up and interrupt us horribly and we have to...[Content truncated]",

Harris was also invited to participate in the convention and “her confirmation is pending,” according to a statement from NABJ leaders.\nMayor Brandon Johnson, who is an enthusiastic supporter of Harris, said in a statement the city was prepared to protect Trump, who survived an assassination attempt on July 13 in Pennsylvania.\n“My administration’s values and practice are in complete opposition to former President Donald Trump’s agenda, but I want the people of Chicago to know that city departments and agencies are fully prepared to uphold safety during his scheduled visit,” Johnson said.\nChicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression and other groups announced plans to protest Trump’s appearance, which comes one day before the annual Lollapalooza music festival is set to take over Grant Park, which is across the street from the hotel.\nTrump’s aborted rally in March 2016 was one of the first indications that political violence would follow the Republican leader throughout his time in public office. Chicago taxpayers paid $248,000 to a mother who said she was .\nIn the weeks leading up to that rally, Trump encouraged violence at his political events, offering to pay the legal expenses of his supporters if they attacked protestors.\nSince that rally was canceled, Trump has repeatedly held up Chicago as the embodiment of all that is wrong with urban America — a “war-torn country” rife with voter fraud and consumed with violence and poverty.\nIn October 2019, Trump traveled to Chicago to speak to a gathering of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Former Supt. Eddie Johnson declined to attend his speech to protest Trump’s efforts to revoke millions of dollars in public safety grants to cities like Chicago because it is a self-proclaimed sanctuary city that prohibits officers from helping federal immigration agents.\nTrump used his speech to attack Johnson and falsely label Chicago’s violence worse than Afghanistan’s.\nFormer Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot responded by calling Trump’s comments “insulting, ignorant buffoonery.”\nJust 8%...[Content truncated]",

In the hours before the event, protesters both inside the event and in surrounding areas made their presence clear, and tension between them and the Trump supporters mounted. Minutes after Trump had been scheduled to take the podium, an announcer declared the event canceled. CNN relayed the following official statement from the Trump campaign:\n> \"Mr. Trump just arrived in Chicago, and after meeting with law enforcement, has determined that for the safety of all of the tens of thousands of people that have gathered in and around the arena, tonight's rally will be postponed to another date. Thank you very much for your attendance and please go in peace.\"\nThe protester faction in attendance erupted into rejoicing, repeatedly chanting “we stopped Trump” as well as \"We shut shit down\" and \"We stumped Trump.\" Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright” also served as a rallying cry.\n#### X content\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it  from.\nSeveral fistfights between Trump supporters and protesters reportedly broke out in the minutes following the announcement, and Chicago police reported five arrests.

At the family home, they also recovered 14 firearms and additional explosives, along with a second cellphone, a laptop and hard drive.\n    \n\n            Investigators have focused on Crooks’ online activity in the months and days before the attack. Family members and people he worked with described him as quiet and a loner but haven’t indicated that he showed any signs of planning an attack. In April, he searched websites for information on major depressive disorder and depressive crisis treatment.\n    \n\n            On his primary cellphone, investigators found an image of the arrest photo of Ethan Crumbley – the student who shot and killed four classmates at a Michigan high school in 2021 – along with information about Crumbley and his parents, who were both found guilty of involuntary manslaughter, the first time parents of a school shooter have been prosecuted.\n    \n\n            Three days after the Trump campaign announced the rally in Butler, a western Pennsylvania town about an hour from Crook’s home, Crooks made numerous searches online for well-known political figures and political events. He searched for the date and location of the Democratic National Convention, which takes place in August in Chicago, and for the location of  the Trump rally. He also searched for information on Trump, Biden and other major political figures.\n    \n\n            On the day of the rally, Crooks made several internet searches, including for photos of the location of Trump’s speech and for a local gun store not far from his home, where he purchased bullets that day.\n    \n\n            Investigators have found data showing that Crooks had visited the location of the rally a week before it was to be held. And on the morning of the rally, he visited the farm where the rally was to be held for over an hour. He then went home, and investigators believe he retrieved an AR-15 rifle owned by his father. Crooks’ father told investigators that he saw his son leave the home with the rifle and believed he was going to a shooting range that the two had frequented.\n    \n\n            On the day of the rally, his parents attempted to reach out to Crooks to find him. He didn’t respond.\n    \n© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.",

Put simply, white supremacy was the law these earliest public officials were sworn to enforce. Even states such as New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois that banned slavery enacted racist “Black laws,” which restricted travel and denied civil rights regarding voting, education, employment, and even residency for free Black people. footnote2_pZW8Xp3T7Sjv2See David Dorado Romo, “To Understand the El Paso Massacre, Look to the Long Legacy of Anti-Mexican Violence at the Border,” Texas Observer, August 9, 2019, https://www.texasobserver.org/to-understand-the-el-paso-massacre-look-to-the-long-legacy-of-anti-mexican-violence-at-the-border/. The U.S. Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which required law enforcement officials in free states to return escaped slaves to their enslavers in the South. footnote3_qJnrRw7WNM9c3Catherine A. Paul, “Fugitive Slave Act of 1850,” Social Welfare History Project, Virginia Commonwealth University Libraries, 2016, https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/federal/fugitive-slave-act-of-1850/.\nWhen slavery was finally abolished in the United States after the Civil War, de jure white supremacy lived on through Black codes and Jim Crow laws. In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, an openly racist law halting Chinese immigration and denying naturalization to Chinese nationals already living in the United States. footnote4_cx1jZxRxPNnO4Irene Hsu, “The Echoes of Chinese Exclusion,” New Republic, June 28, 2018, https://newrepublic.com/article/149437/echoes-chinese-exclusion. The Immigration Act of 1924 was also explicitly racist, codifying strict national origin quotas to limit Italian, eastern European, and nonwhite immigration. The law barred all immigration from Japan and other Asian countries not already excluded by previous legislation. footnote5_mkhoGmd9T6iW5“The Immigration Act of 1924 (The Johnson-Reed Act),” Office of the Historian, Department of State, https://history.state.gov/milestones/192...[Content truncated]",
