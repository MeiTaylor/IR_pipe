Trump’s campaign abruptly canceled his rally here on Friday night over security concerns as protesters clashed with his supporters inside an arena where he was to speak.\nMinutes after Mr. Trump was to have taken to a podium on the campus of a large, diverse public university just west of downtown, an announcer suddenly pronounced the event over before it had begun. Hundreds of protesters, who had promised to be a visible presence here and filled several sections of the arena, let out an elated, unstopping cheer. Mr. Trump’s supporters, many of whom had waited hours to see the Republican front-runner, seemed stunned and slowly filed out in anger.\nAround the country, protesters have interrupted virtually every Trump rally, but his planned appearance here — in a city run for decades by Democrats and populated by nearly equal thirds of blacks, Latinos and whites — had drawn some particularly incensed responses since it was announced days ago.\nThe canceled rally came on a day that Mr. Trump sought to move past the primary fight, saying that the party needed to come together behind him.\nElsewhere, Mr. Trump’s security has tried to identify and exclude potential demonstrators before they enter his events, but large groups of protesters had waited in line for seats here, and engaged in tense disputes with Trump supporters even as the University of Illinois at Chicago Pavilion was still filling up. For more than an hour before the event was to begin, security teams led protesters out, one by one, but many more remained, sparring with Trump supporters.\nIn a statement, Mr. Trump’s campaign said that he “has determined that for the safety of all of the tens of thousands of people that have gathered in and around the arena, tonight’s rally will be postponed to another date.”\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Protesters crowded the sidewalks, pushing at barricades formed by police as they tried to block Trump supporters’ cars from leaving.\n!\nA Trump supporter reacts to protesters inside the UIC Pavilion. Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images\nA spontaneous blockade of a parking garage formed, creating a standoff between screaming Trump supporters in the multi-level lot and screaming protesters on the ground below.\nFrom high up Trump supporters reportedly spat down on protesters who were chanting “Fuck Donald Trump” and preventing anyone leaving. Eventually, after police cleared a path for people to depart, protesters jeered and gestured at each car and its occupants making their way past barricades and a long column of mounted police.\nIn the parking garage afterwards, Nerijus Meskauskus, a Trump supporter from Oak Lawn, Illinois described being assaulted by protesters. He told the Guardian that he had been holding an American flag and smoking a cigarette with fellow Trump supporters after the rally when someone came up and grabbed the flag. As Meskauskus described it, he was surrounded by protesters and punched “six or seven times” before “cops grabbed me and pulled me over the barricade”. He said protesters were “trying to jump the barricade to attack me”.\nThe scenes of violence sparked condemnation for the tenor of Trump’s campaign from his top rival for the GOP nomination, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. “A campaign bears responsibility for creating an environment,” said Cruz. “The predictable consequence of \\ is it escalates. Today is unlikely to be the last such instance.”\n!\nA protester burns a Trump campaign flag outside the venue. Photograph: Jonathan Gibby/Getty Images\nThe Ohio governor, John Kasich, took a similar line. “Tonight the seeds of division that Donald Trump has been sowing this whole campaign finally bore fruit, and it was ugly.”\nMarco Rubio, the Florida senator, had harsh words for the protesters, telling Fox News there was “an industry” of protest movements in Chicago with some participants “probably being paid to do this.”\nPolitical violence on the scale witnessed on Friday is rare in American politics.\nFamously the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago witnessed repeated clashes between the police and anti-war protesters culminating in what a federal commission called “a police riot”.\nBut the three-way conflict between Trump supporters and protesters with the police caught in the middle is something unusual and represents a disturbing trend in an election where many of the norms and mores of American politics have gone by the wayside.\nA demonstrator in St.L...[Content truncated]",

Thank you very much for your attendance and please go in peace.”\nInside the Peabody Opera House in St. Louis earlier in the day, protesters interrupted Trump eight times, prompting catcalls and chants from the crowd as security officers removed them. Scores were injured or arrested in clashes between Trump supporters and critics outside the venue, where thousands had gathered in an overflow area to listen to the event over loudspeakers.\nTrump is known for his massive, raucous rallies — part campaign events, part media spectacles, part populist exaltations for his most loyal supporters. But the events have also become suffused with the kind of hostility and even violence that are unknown to modern presidential campaigns.\nAmid growing security concerns, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign canceled a Chicago rally on March 11.

Here’s the Proof,” Washington Post, June 10, 2020, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2018/09/18/theres-overwhelming-evidence-that-the-criminal-justice-system-is-racist-heres-the-proof/. These systemic inequities can also instill implicit biases — unconscious prejudices\n    that favor in-groups and stigmatize out-groups — among individual law enforcement officials, influencing their\n    day-to-day actions while interacting with the public. \nPolice reforms, often imposed after incidents of racist misconduct or brutality, have focused on addressing these\n    unconscious manifestations of bias. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), for example, has required implicit bias\n    training as part of consent decrees it imposes to root out discriminatory practices in law enforcement agencies.\n    Such training measures are designed to help law enforcement officers recognize these unconscious biases in order to\n    reduce their influence on police behavior.\nThese reforms, while well-intentioned, leave unaddressed an especially harmful form of bias, which remains entrenched\n    within law enforcement: explicit racism. Explicit racism in law enforcement takes many forms, from membership or\n    affiliation with violent white supremacist or far-right militant groups, to engaging in racially discriminatory\n    behavior toward the public or law enforcement colleagues, to making racist remarks and sharing them on social media.\n    While it is widely acknowledged that racist officers subsist within police departments around the country, federal,\n    state, and local governments are doing far too little to proactively identify them, report their behavior to\n    prosecutors who might unwittingly rely on their testimony in criminal cases, or protect the diverse communities they\n    are sworn to serve.\nEfforts to address systemic and implicit biases in law enforcement are unlikely to be effective in reducing the\n    racial disparities in the criminal justice system as long as explicit racism in law enforcement continues to endure.\n    There is ample evidence to demonstrate that it does.\nIn 2017, the FBI reported that white supremacists posed a “persistent threat of lethal violence” that has\n    produced more fatalities than any other category of domestic terrorists since 2000. footnote3_yF81aemce5tf3Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Homeland Security, Joint\n    Intelligence Bulletin, White Supremacist Extremism Poses Persistent Threat of Lethal Violence, May 10,\n    2017, https://www.document...[Content truncated]",
