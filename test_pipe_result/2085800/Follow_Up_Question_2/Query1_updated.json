Trump is safe, according to the Secret Service, but at least one rally attendee and the shooter were killed, according to reports.\nBut the moment is sure to intensify an already fraught election year, in which elected officials have faced an increasing number of threats and fear of violence.\nA survey conducted in late June from the University of Chicago found that there is now more support for violence against Trump (10% of American adults, or 26 million people) compared with violence in favor of Trump (6.9%, or 18 million people). Until January, the survey showed there was more support for violence in favor of Trump.\nAnd of the 26 million American adults who support violence to prevent Trump from regaining the presidency, more than 30% own guns and almost 80% have access to internet organizational tools.\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a link to the video instead.\n\u201cThere are more violent anti-Trump sentiments than pro-Trump sentiments,\u201d Bob Pape, a professor at the University of Chicago who directs the Chicago Project on Security and Threats, had said in an interview before the incident on Saturday night.\n\u201cSo we have to be prepared for violence coming from the left in opposition to Trump\u2019s rule.\u201d\nThe rise in support for political violence in the US comes at a time of extreme partisanship, rampant misinformation on social media, and violent rhetoric from Trump and his allies. Those factors came together on 6 January 2021 when thousands of people stormed the US Capitol.\nAccording to the survey, which was first shared with the Guardian as part of a series on political violence and attitudes towards democracy, the underlying causes of support for violence on both sides of the aisle both stem from distrust of the establishment and beliefs in conspiracy theories.\nOn both sides,...[Content truncated]",

Yet Joey Glimco, longtime extortion racketeer in Chicago\u2019s West Side poultry markets, at age 50 is an official of the U.S.\u2019s biggest and most powerful labor union: James Riddle Hoffa\u2019s Teamster Brotherhood (TIME, Aug. 31). in which he is president of Teamster Local 777 (taxi drivers) and boss of the Teamster joint council of Chicago. He has made crime pay exceedingly well. The Chicago Crime Commission estimated his rake-in from all sources\u2014union salaries, business profits, kickbacks, extortion payoffs\u2014at $70,000 a month.\nIn Washington last week, the three-member board of monitors, set up by Federal Judge F. Dickinson Letts to oversee Teamster affairs, confronted President Hoffa with an order to get rid of Joey Glimco. The monitors want Hoffa to suspend Glimco from the presidency of Local 777 and have the local\u2019s financial records audited by a reliable firm. Among other things, charged the monitors, Glimco: \n\u00b6Spent $124,000 of Local 777\u2019s funds defending himself against an extortion indictment.\n\u00b6Raked in $2,500 a month in salary kickbacks from Local 777 officers.\n\u00b6 Squandered union funds on such off-duty items as a suburban love nest for his mistress and $10,600 in country-club bills for a Local 777 crony.\nWhether or not Jimmy Hoffa would comply was another matter; so far, he has managed to avoid carrying out nearly all of the monitors\u2019 54 recommendations.\nContact us at letters@time.com",

Secret Service agents shot and killed the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, almost immediately after he fired at Trump\u00a0shortly after 6 p.m. on Saturday. \nThere is no evidence of a second shooter. Reports from local law enforcement, the U.S. Secret Service, journalists at the event, eye witnesses and hundreds of hours of social media video show there was one gunman at the event, who was located on a roof close to the tower. \nHowever, the claim spread almost immediately after the shooting, with users sharing blurred videos to falsely claim it showed a figure on the tower. One of the earliest mentions of the water tower posted to X shortly after the shooting suggested the possibility of movement on top of the water tower. Within an hour, other users posted photos and videos of the rally with captions that echoed the claim. \nThe false claim was picked up by social media users with large followings, who posted references to the water tower. On X, formerly known as Twitter, community notes were added to some of the posts,\u00a0...[Content truncated]",

But while protesters are not uncommon at political events, Trump\u2019s rallies are the only ones that have seen a rash of violent incidents in response to them.\nOn stage at events, Trump has encouraged this violence at times. On one occasion, he even pledged to pay legal fees for those who \u201croughed up\u201d protesters. \u201cKnock the crap out of him, would you? Seriously, OK, just knock the hell. I promise you I will pay for the legal fees, I promise, I promise,\u201d Trump said in a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in February. He also urged security at a January rally in Vermont to confiscate protesters\u2019 coats before booting them out into the winter night.\nHowever, Trump has also urged supporters \u201cdon\u2019t hurt \u2019em\u201d on other occasions as protesters have been escorted out. Each Trump rally now begins with a taped warning telling supporters: \u201cIf a protester starts demonstrating in the area around you, please do not touch or harm the protester.\u201d\nAt Thursday\u2019s Republican debate, Trump defended himself from accusations that...[Content truncated]",
