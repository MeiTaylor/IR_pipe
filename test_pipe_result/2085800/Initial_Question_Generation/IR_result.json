To a Black audience, he yet again bragged he did more for Black people than any president since Abraham Lincoln — earning the instant rejoinder (which he ignored) from ABC News’s Rachel Scott: “Better than President Johnson, who signed the Voting Rights Act?”\nRather than repeat ourselves, we have provided links to previous fact checks at the end of this report.\nInstead we will focus on a fresh claim he made.

(AP Photo / Manuel Balce Ceneta)\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats on Sunday accused President Donald Trump of trying to inflame racial tensions to benefit his campaign as he praised supporters who clashed with protesters in Portland, Oregon, where one man died overnight, and announced he will travel to Kenosha, Wisconsin, amid anger over the shooting of another Black man by police.\nThanks to our sponsors:\n-----------------------\n---------------------------------------------------\nTrump’s tweets came hours after a man identified as a supporter of a right-wing group was shot and killed in Portland when a large caravan of Trump’s supporters and Black Lives Matter protesters clashed in the city’s streets. Trump praised the caravan participants as “GREAT PATRIOTS!” and blamed the city’s Democratic mayor for the death.\nTrump has throughout the summer cast American cities as under siege by violence and lawlessness, despite the fact that most of the protests demonstrating against racial injustice have been largely peaceful. With about nine weeks until Election Day, some of his advisers see an aggressive “law and order” message as the best way for the president to turn voters against his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, and regain the support of suburban voters, particularly women, who have abandoned him. But Democrats accuse Trump of rooting for unrest and trying to stoke further violence for political gain instead of ratcheting down tensions.\nBiden in a statement said he “unequivocally” condemned violence on all side, while accusing Trump of “...[Content truncated]",

Trump clashed with protesters inside a scheduled campaign event in Chicago.CreditCredit...Charles Rex Arbogast/Associated Press\n*   March 11, 2016\nCHICAGO — With thousands of people already packed into stands and music blaring to warm up the crowd,  campaign abruptly canceled his rally here on Friday night over security concerns as protesters clashed with his supporters inside an arena where he was to speak.\nMinutes after Mr. Trump was to have taken to a podium on the campus of a large, diverse public university just west of downtown, an announcer suddenly pronounced the event over before it had begun. Hundreds of protesters, who had promised to be a visible presence here and filled several sections of the arena, let out an elated, unstopping cheer. Mr. Trump’s supporters, many of whom had waited hours to see the Republican front-runner, seemed stunned and slowly filed out in anger.\nAround the country, protesters have interrupted virtually every Trump rally, but his planned appearance here — in a city run for decades by Democrats and populated by nearly equal thirds of blacks, Latinos and whites — had drawn some particularly incensed responses since it was announced days ago.\nThe canceled rally came on...[Content truncated]",

Trump clashed with protesters inside a scheduled campaign event in Chicago.CreditCredit...Charles Rex Arbogast/Associated Press\n*   March 11, 2016\nCHICAGO — With thousands of people already packed into stands and music blaring to warm up the crowd,  campaign abruptly canceled his rally here on Friday night over security concerns as protesters clashed with his supporters inside an arena where he was to speak.\nMinutes after Mr. Trump was to have taken to a podium on the campus of a large, diverse public university just west of downtown, an announcer suddenly pronounced the event over before it had begun. Hundreds of protesters, who had promised to be a visible presence here and filled several sections of the arena, let out an elated, unstopping cheer. Mr. Trump’s supporters, many of whom had waited hours to see the Republican front-runner, seemed stunned and slowly filed out in anger.\nAround the country, protesters have interrupted virtually every Trump rally, but his planned appearance here — in a city run for decades by Democrats and populated by nearly equal thirds of blacks, Latinos and whites — had drawn some particularly incensed responses since it was announced days ago.\nThe canceled rally came on...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "Does the Ohio rally video corroborate the claim of a black Trump supporter being shot in Chicago?",
        "Answer": "The Ohio rally video does not corroborate the claim of a black supporter of Donald Trump being shot and killed by protesters in Chicago. 1. **Different Events**: The video primarily focuses on an incident during a Donald Trump rally in Ohio, where a protester was escorted out by Secret Service agents due to a perceived threat. This event is distinct from the violence and chaos that occurred at a different rally in Chicago on the same weekend (March 11, 2016). There is no mention in the Ohio video of any shooting incident or specific reference to a black Trump supporter being harmed. 2. **Chicago Events**: Evidence from various reports highlights that the Chicago rally was called off due to violent clashes between Trump supporters and protesters, resulting in a chaotic scene with scuffles, but does not mention any shootings or fatalities involving a Trump supporter. 3. **Absence of Shooting Incident Information**: The references provided regarding the Chicago rally focus on the cancellation of the event, the protests, and the confrontations but do not provide any details about a shooting or the death of a supporter. Therefore, based on the information analyzed, it is clear that the Ohio rally video does not provide any supporting evidence for the claim regarding a shooting of a black Trump supporter in Chicago.",
