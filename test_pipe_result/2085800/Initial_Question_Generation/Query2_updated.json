As the mayhem took hold, Trump was reduced to complaining about the situation on the air, telling MSNBC: \u201cIt\u2019s sad when you can\u2019t have a rally. Whatever happened to freedom of speech?\u201d\nThe rally had been due to take place at a university that is one of the most diverse in the country, at a venue situated in the heart of , a Democratic stronghold where there are few registered Republicans.\nBefore the rally was even due to start, the scene for the evening was set as protesters inside the pavilion vented their opposition to the presidential candidate\u2019s positions on immigration, race and other issues where his rhetoric has proven divisive.\nThe shouts on both sides were often crude and vulgar. Trump supporters yelled \u201cGo back to Univision\u201d at Hispanic people and hurled a racially charged insult at an African American woman; while those opposed to the candidate shouted \u201cFuck Donald Trump\u201d and taunted police officers.\n!\nProtesters celebrate after it is announced that the rally has been cancelled.

When the Trump campaign announced that the rally would not take place, there was a great deal of shouting and a few small scuffles between Trump supporters and anti-Trump protesters.\n\nPlans to protest the Trump rally were launched a week in advance by a variety of community and student groups who largely organized via social media. Some 43,000 undergraduate and graduate students had signed a petition asking UIC to cancel the rally by March 6.[6] That same day, Latino leaders in the city, led by Democratic U.S. Representative Luis Gutierrez of Chicago, issued a call to their constituents to join them in a protest outside the UIC Pavilion, where the rally was to take place.[7] One of many student-based protests was first proposed by 20-year-old Chicago political activist and Bernie Sanders supporter Ja'Mal Green, who had posted to Facebook a week urging others to \"get your tickets to this. We're all going in!!!! #SHUTITDOWN.\"[8] Green told reporters that the plan was for protestors to make noise when Trump appeared, \"and then rush the stage.\"[9] While \"activist groups did try to disrupt the event, ... many protesters said that they learned of the demonstrations...[Content truncated]",
