(WLS) -- As President Donald Trump visited Kenosha Tuesday, conflicting sets of demonstrators took to the streets near the city's center of civil unrest.\nThe president's ardent supporters were there to welcome him to the city, and so were protesters demanding justice for Jacob Blake, the 29-year-old man shot seven times in the back by a Kenosha police officer nine days ago.\n****\n\"It's a play.

You've attacked Black journalists\u2014calling them a loser, saying the questions that they asked are quote, 'stupid' and 'racist,'\" Scott said. \"Why should Black voters trust you after you have used language like that?\"\n\"I don't think I've ever been asked a question in such a horrible manner\u2014first question,\" Trump said in response. \"You don't even say, 'Hello, how are you?'\"\nTrump also seemingly accused event organizers of holding up the start of the event, which was scheduled to begin at noon in Chicago, but didn't kick off until after 1 p.m.\n\"I think it's disgraceful that I came here in good spirit.

Two were conservatives killed after pro-Trump \u201cpatriot rallies\u201d. All but one were killed by fellow citizens.\nThe new data highlights the danger of the presence of guns during politically charged protests, and raises concerns about continued violence during and after election day, when many Americans anticipate delays, confusion and protests before the winner of the presidential race is confirmed.\nThe new data on fatalities and violence at American protests comes from a database created by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (ACLED), a non-profit, working in collaboration with a group of researchers at Princeton.\nACLED, a widely cited source for data on civilian casualties in Yemen, has been a non-partisan monitor of protests and violence in the Middle East, Asia, Europe and Latin America, and launched its US Crisis Monitor in July, citing concerns over hate crimes and rising political violence.\nACLED found that the overwhelming majority of the more than 9.000 Black Lives Matter demonstrations that took place across the US after the killing of George Floyd have been peaceful. News reports at the height of demonstrations over Floyd\u2019s killing cited dozens of deaths in connection with protests, but many of those turned out to be examples of deadly crimes carried out in the vicinity of protests, rather than directly related to...[Content truncated]",
