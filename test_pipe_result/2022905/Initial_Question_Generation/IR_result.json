    "QA": {
        "Question": "Did Donald Trump identify himself as an atheist in his 1989 interview with Phil Donahue?",
        "Answer": "No, Donald Trump did not identify himself as an atheist in his 1989 interview with Phil Donahue. A widely circulated meme claims that Trump asserted he was too smart to believe in God during a 1989 episode of the show, stating, “I have a really high IQ, Phil. I mean, c'mon. It's impossible for me to not be Atheist.” However, investigations by fact-checking organizations like Snopes have found no evidence that Trump ever said this or that he even appeared on The Phil Donahue Show in 1989. In fact, Trump was a guest on the show in 1987, and during that appearance, there is no record of him discussing his religious beliefs or lack thereof.",
