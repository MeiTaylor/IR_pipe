If she sat there quietly and politely and spoke about the wrongs of civil rights [abuse], who the fuck would listen?\"\nLeo, who won an Academy Award for her role as the long-suffering mother in  The Fighter, yells that last line somewhat for effect. She's at SXSW, promoting  Most Hated Woman and a Showtime comedy series called  I'm Dying Up Here, and she has clearly given O'Hair's bad rep some thought. As the founder of American Atheists, she received a lot of donations among the piles of hate mail. Quite a bit of that money ended up in a private account in New Zealand; her creative bookkeeping was partly responsible for her demise. On the subject of O'Hair's self-enrichment, Leo is also forgiving. \"Everybody's got to earn a living,\" she says, \"and it was already established that it was very difficult for her to work within the system.\" (Before her success with the Baltimore suit, O'Hair had been fired from several jobs.) \"I had a mother like that myself, a wonderful woman she was; no one could call her a bitch or a pariah. But that woman had a hard time holding a job, primarily because she was working for men, who liked to do it a certain way.\"\nEven by contemporary standards, O'Hair's family life was unconventional. She lived with her devout parents as she railed against religion. Both of her sons were born out of wedlock, and she filed her school-prayer suit in the name of the eldest, William Murray Jr., played by Vincent Kartheiser (Mad Men's Pete Campbell), who wittingly or not became the poster child for atheism in America. The film depicts young Bill entering his classroom with his mother as the Lord's Prayer is being recited; later, we see an older Bill in an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, speaking of \"a sudden rush of sorrow\" that brought him into the program. And then the meeting ends with the assembled reciting\u2026the Lord's Prayer. (\"Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\u2026\") In 1980, Murray told his mother he had embraced Jesus; a few years later, after battling over his conversion in public, O'Hair disowned her son. \"Goddamn zombie 12-steppers got ahold of him,\" says O'Hair in the film.\n\"Every child has to make his rebellion,\" says Leo. \"That's what growing up is. And depending on what the foundation is, the rebellion can be the opening to an adult relationship between the grown-up child and the parent, or it can be the...[Content truncated]",

This incident set off a months-long battle of words, with each side declaring that the other was undermining the broader efforts of the movement.\nTaylor issued a nonsectarian statement in which he said that all sorts of extremists would be welcome at his conferences as long as they acted appropriately. That didn\u2019t sit well with some of his racist Jewish supporters, such as Hart, who had hoped for a more declarative statement banning antisemites from the conferences. Such former associates of Taylor as onetime American Renaissance webmaster Ian Jobling and well-known anti-black commentator Lawrence Auster have spoken out against Taylor\u2019s refusal to clearly condemn antisemitism. (Jobling left the movement and in 2012 spoke about his experiences in an interview with the Southern Poverty Law Center.)\nThe 2006 dispute had the look of a major split in the group. In one email, Shawn Mercer, co-founder and moderator of AR List, an American Renaissance email group, warned, \u201cThese are the makings of a major schism.\u201d But the 2008 American Renaissance conference was held and drew a substantial crowd, even as the \u201cJewish question\u201d remained unresolved.\nTaylor has some support from far-right organizations. In 2008, he was invited to speak at Michigan State University by the campus chapter of Young Americans for Freedom. In ensuing years, he continued to network effectively with white nationalists and wrote regularly for the racist, anti-immigrant website VDARE and others.\nIn 2011, Taylor spoke at the National Policy Institute (NPI), a racist think-tank whose mission statement says it aims \u201cto elevate the consciousness of whites, ensure our biological and cultural continuity, and protect our civil rights,\u201d as well as to \u201cstudy the consequences of the ongoing influx that non-Western populations pose to our national identity.\u201d Taylor has spoken at additional NPI conferences since then.\nTaylor suspended publication of his magazine after the January 2012 issue, concentrating instead on building up his website, Amren.com. The site makes several posts on weekdays about racial issues and features a lively comment section filled with white nationalists.\nOn Sept. 29, 2014, Taylor and other white nationalists began to arrive in Hungary to attend an international conference of anti-immigrant and far-right extremists. Co-hosted by Taylor and Richard Spencer\u2019s National Policy Institute (NPI), the symposium was intended to link white nationalists from around the world. (Most of the attendees were from America and Europe.) Taylor and Spencer may have chosen Hungary because of what they anticipated would be a politically hospitable environment, given the far-right political ideology of Prime...[Content truncated]",

What insight this teenager had, and then for him to move on and evolve into the Greatest of All Time, which, honest to god, I don't believe is an overstatement. I think he was the athlete of the 20th century, and I think he should've won the Nobel Peace Prize. \"I ain't got nothing against no Viet Cong. No Viet Cong ever called me nigger.\" He was pilloried for this. He lost his championship status. Talk about moral courage, he was a rock. \nDHS: Let's talk about Erma Bombeck. I hear you have a long and fascinating with Erma Bombeck, who I consider one of the greatest comedy writers America has ever produced. \nPD: She was extremely gifted. In the list of the top ten best-selling books of the 1970s, Erma had two. It is true we lived across the street from each other on Cushwa Drive in Centerville, Ohio. This was one of the first cookie-cutter, suburban community. All the houses were the same: detached, same floor plan, no basement, three bedrooms. Diagonally across the street were the Bombecks. We both belonged to the same church.

I was doing much of what we began the Donahue Show with: feminist issues, what our children are seeing, daddy goes off to work with a briefcase and mommy does to the basement to do wash and what is this doing to our kids. We'd do shows like that. Obviously Erma had tuned in. \"Hey neighbor, I'll do a piece.\" I'd never been this excited in my life. No one ever wanted to interview me. It was very flattering. At that point it meant so much to me.\nDHS: I'm curious, why do you think America took to Erma Bombeck? What about her captivated people, besides her obvious talent, in terms of her message? \nPD: I eulogized Erma in 1996. It wasn't just that she was the best; she was the only.

I\u2019m Paul Jay.\nOur guest today is probably someone that helped create this show in a sort of way, Phil Donahue. He\u2019s not just a legend in broadcasting. He\u2019s one of the more important figures politically, I think, at least in terms of media. There\u2019s very few people in American media that stand up and stick their neck out and take a risk and even suffer the consequences for it. Well, Mr. Donohue\u2019s one of those people. And it\u2019s a privilege for us for him to join us here.\nThanks very much.\n**PHIL DONAHUE, TV TALK SHOW HOST:** Pleasure, Paul.\n**JAY:** So here\u2019s a little bit of introduction. Phil Donahue\u2019s an Emmy Award-winning media personality. He\u2019s best known as the creator and host of the Donahue Show, which ran for 29 years on cable TV and I think was the longest-running talk show on TV, or still is. Still is? That\u2019s a funny way to phrase it. It is not on the air anymore, but it\u2019s still the longest running. Nobody has caught up to you yet, I believe.\n**DONAHUE:** To my knowledge. I\u2019m not sure.\n**JAY:** So Wikipedia says, anyway. He also was the host of Donahue, which ran from July 2002 to March 2003, before msnbc canceled it because of his vocal opposition to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. This was despite it being the most highly rated show at the time on msnbc network. He\u2019s also the codirector of Body of War, a documentary film about the struggles of an Iraq War veteran and antiwar activist, Tomas Young.\nSo, for those of you at home that don\u2019t know, although I think most of you that watch do know, we usually start with a personal segment, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do with Mr. Donahue, kind of more about what helped shape his view of the world. And then we\u2019ll talk about his views on more recent events.\nSo you\u2019re born in 1935...[Content truncated]",
