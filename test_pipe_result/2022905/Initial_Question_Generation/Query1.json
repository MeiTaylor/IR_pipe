DeJoy_, 143 S. Ct. 2279 (2023). The _Groff_ opinion clarified that “showing ‘more than a _de minimis_ cost’…does not suffice to establish undue hardship under Title VII.” Instead, the Supreme Court held that “undue hardship is shown when a burden is substantial in the overall context of an employer’s business,” “tak\\ into account all relevant factors in the case at hand, including the particular accommodations at issue and their practical impact in light of the nature, size and operating cost of an employer.” _Groff_ supersedes any contrary information on this webpage.

She knew I was an actor but she never saw me become successful.\nHad my Dad lived, I might have done something different with my life. When he died it was a very destabilising experience for me in ways I can't even explain. He was a very powerful figure, president of Yale University, a professor of English renaissance literature, very academic; super-charismatic; solid. And then he moved into the administration of major league baseball, so it was a very curious sort of career trajectory. He died just like that. A heart attack at 50. His death threw everybody for a big loop.\nI had just graduated from Yale – in English – and thought about going into academic life, though I don't think I would have been suited to it. It is because my dad died suddenly that I became an actor. I thought, I'm going to make money doing this thing I enjoy.\nHome was New Haven, Connecticut. Academia is a rarified culture, especially an Ivy League academic background. There were books all over the place and my mother was a big reader. It's a curious thing growing up in academia....[Content truncated]",

And it's kind of nice that I can say here -- if one of them asked me -- it ended in a tie game. [Laughter]\nAt the risk of sounding facetious, I just want to say here in this room -- and as has been so eloquently stated by the people who've spoken already -- about the uniqueness of how all of us, from so many different heritages, have come together here in the name of that one man. I have long been unable to understand the atheist in this world of so much beauty. And I've had an unholy desire to invite some atheists to a dinner and then serve the most fabulous gourmet dinner that has ever been concocted and, after dinner, ask them if they believe there was a cook. [Laughter]\nBut I want to thank each of you for being here today and for sharing with us the spiritual message that God has placed in your hearts. God's love shines through every word. His truth is the ultimate power source, and it's always there. It's available to ministers of the Gospel, Presidents, and the local grocery clerk. His comforting hand -- well, I could never carry the responsibilities of this high office without it.\nOur forefathers drew on the wisdom and strength of God when they turned a vast wilderness into a blessed land of plenty called the United States of America. God has truly blessed this country, but we never should fall into the trap that would detract from the universality of God's gift. It is for all mankind. God's love is the hope and the light of the world.\nRecently a letter found its way to my desk, I'm pleased to say, and in that letter was a copy of a prayer. It was sent to me by a woman who had lost her husband in World War II. This prayer had been written and delivered in a shellhole during World War II. It read:\nHear me, oh God; never in the whole of my lifetime have I spoken to You, but just now I feel like sending You my greetings.\nYou know, from childhood on, they've always told me You are not. I, like a fool, believed them.\nI've never contemplated your creation, and yet tonight, gazing up out of my shell hole, I marveled at the shimmering stars above me and suddenly knew the cruelty of the lie.\nWill You, my God, reach your hand out to me, I wonder?

I quoted Carl Sagan: “An atheist has to know a lot more than I know. An atheist is someone who knows there is no God.”\nPeople who contact me want to know where the quote came from. Answer: He said it to me in an interview. (I might even have it on tape somewhere in the bottom of a file box). He said identical, or similar things, many times. You can find such material in his voluminous papers . For example:\nTo Robert Pope, of Windsor, Ontario, Oct. 2, 1996\n> “**I am not an atheist**. An atheist is someone who has compelling evidence that there is no Judeo-Christian-Islamic God. I am not that wise, but neither do I consider there to be anything approaching adequate evidence for such a god. Why are you in such a hurry to make up your mind? Why not simply wait until there is compelling evidence?” \\\nTo Stephen Jay Gould, Dec. 18, 1989, after a newspaper editorial referred to Sagan and Gould as “dogmatic” on the question of whether there is a God:\n> “Do you understand how – assuming either of us ever did say ‘The universe can be explained without postulating God’ – this could be understood as dogmatic? I often talk about the ‘God hypothesis’ as something I’d be fully willing to accept if there were compelling evidence; unfortunately, there is nothing approaching compelling evidence. That attitude, it seems to me, is undogmatic.”\nDoes this wait-and-see attitude make Sagan an “agnostic”? That word seems inadequate to me. Yes, he held out the possibility of a God, but believed that possibility to be very small. His position was the strictly scientific one: Knowledge is always provisional and contingent upon further data.\nDavid Grinspoon, a planetary scientist whose father was Sagan’s best friend, and who referred to Sagan as “Uncle Carl,” tells me by e-mail:\n“In his adult life he was very close to being an atheist.  I personally had several conversations with him about religion,...[Content truncated]",

Yet, as there is so often when race is the topic, the back story behind the hymn that is suddenly everywhere is not so simple.\nAmazing Grace was written by an Englishman who in the early part of his life was an outspoken atheist, libertine, and slave trader. John Newton was born in London in 1725, the son of a Puritan mother and a stern ship commander father who took him to sea when he was 11 (“I am persuaded that he loved me but he seemed not willing that I should know it,” he later wrote).\nBy 1745, Newton was enlisted in the slave trade, running captured slaves from Africa to, ironically, Charleston, S.C. After he rode out a storm at sea in 1748, he found his faith. He was ordained an Anglican priest in 1764 and became an important voice in the English abolitionist movement. At that time he wrote the autobiographical Amazing Grace, along with 280 other hymns.\nToday Amazing Grace is beloved by Presidents and citizens alike and remains a go-to hymn at American funerals, because of its striking melodies and ever-popular narrative of personal redemption. The born-again Jimmy Carter was the first recent President to embrace Amazing Grace, singing it with everyone from Willie Nelson to Senate Majority leader Robert Byrd.\nBut this spiritual is nonpartisan. It was performed at the funeral of Ronald Reagan by Ronan Tynan and at Gerald Ford’s funeral by a single bagpiper. At Richard Nixon’s funeral, Billy Graham quoted from Amazing Grace in his eulogy and told the story of John Newton, crediting him for later working to end the English slave trade.\nRace is the moëbius strip of American life, always turning and eating its own tail. President Obama may have thought he was choosing a lovely hymn to comfort the afflicted, which he surely did. But, as always, salvation is not so simple.\nContact us at letters@time.com",
