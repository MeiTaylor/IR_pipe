We have the Chega movement doing well in Portugal, with the young especially. In Germany, the ultraright-wing Alternative for Germany surged in last month\u2019s European parliamentary elections. In France, Marine Le Pen\u2019s populist party also triumphed in the European election, a result that prompted President Emmanuel Macron to call new national elections and throw the entire French political system into meltdown. In the U.K.\u2019s forthcoming national elections, Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform Party is on pace to win seats for the first time. So if you\u2019re a historian telling the big story of what\u2019s happening, what would it be? What\u2019s the core narrative here?_\nSTEVE BANNON: Well, I think it\u2019s very simple: that the ruling elites of the West lost confidence in themselves. The elites have lost their faith in their countries. They\u2019ve lost faith in the Westphalian system, the nation-state. They are more and more detached from the lived experience of their people.\n to read as many articles as you like.\nDavid Brooks is an Opinion columnist for The Times, writing about political, social and cultural trends. \nA version of this article appears in print on July 7, 2024, Section SR, Page 12 of the New York edition with the headline: How Steve Bannon Sees the Future.  |  | \nAdvertisement",

From John F. Kennedy\u2019s having to assure a convention of ministers in 1960 that he would not be making policy according to secret brainwaves directed at him from the Vatican, to the highly profitable embrace between movement conservative politics and what once was known as the religious right, to watching Barack Obama invite Rick Warren to bless his first inauguration, we\u2019ve allowed more than a little incense to filter into the profane corridors of political power.\nAs we have done so, I have become increasingly convinced that Madison had the right idea\u2014that organized religion should be kept out of the secular government for the same reasons that we keep toddlers away from cutlery. At this point, the spirituality of a political candidate is little more than another issue paper, a talking point to be massaged, one line on your professional CV, along with your law degree and your devotion to the flag and puppies. One is obliged now to render to Caesar and to God in similar currencies.\nSooner or later, if you make religion a mandatory exercise in the selection of a secular official, you are going to find yourself ruled either by a liar or a faker. Performance piety is much easier to fake than actual piety and less liable to turn people off. Enter, then, the world of\u00a0_The Faith of Donald J. Trump_, a new book by David Brody, the chief political correspondent for the Christian Broadcasting Network, and Scott Lamb, a Baptist minister and the vice president of Liberty University, the Christian institution founded by the late Jerry Falwell in 1971.\nTo the casual observer, it would appear that Brody and Lamb set themselves a heroic task. By all available evidence, Donald Trump is the most thoroughgoing heathen we\u2019ve ever installed in the White House. There are seven deadly sins in the church of my birth and over the course of his life, Trump has wrung the bell loudly and publicly on at least six of them\u2014lust, gluttony, greed, wrath, envy, and pride. (Nobody ever would attribute sloth to him. After all, he\u2019s always worked incredibly hard committing the other six.) He is more of a hound than JFK, eats worse than William Howard Taft, grabs for gold more enthusiastically than did Grant\u2019s entire Cabinet, erupts in unbridled rage over things he sees on television more often than late-period LBJ, boils over perceived slights more heatedly than Nixon, and has an opinion of himself that makes Andy Jackson look like a Poor Clare. Religion has been as much in evidence in Donald Trump\u2019s public life as vegetables...[Content truncated]",

Yes, they wanted me to have a religious education. But they also wanted to know that, for at least six hours a day, I'd be in a place that reflected their own Christian values. Values they believed would make me a better person, and would keep me safe from the temptations and moral depravity of the secular world. \nIn fifth grade, they moved me to the public school, and it felt just totally wild to me. I could wear pants instead of dresses. Kids talked back to teachers, and the really bad kids wrote curse words on the back of the seats on the bus. I remember saying a prayer for one of them because I was convinced that he was damned to hell after that. \nIt was definitely a transition, but I figured out how to navigate myself outside of my little Baptist school bubble. And at that time, it's what my parents intended. They knew I had to learn how to operate in the real world \u2013 full of people with different values and perspectives and life experiences. \nJon Ward grew up in a more isolating corner of Christianity. He was raised in an evangelical church in the D.C. area that defined his life, his friends, his family \u2013 his whole identity. He was taught never to question the teachings of the Bible, or the judgment of the men who led his church. And he was discouraged from ever engaging in the world outside his religious community.\nWard had other plans though. After college, he decided to pursue a career in journalism. It was a choice that would fracture his family. Through his work as a political journalist, Ward learned how to interrogate assumptions, how to question authority, and eventually that meant questioning the church he grew up in \u2014 and leaving it altogether. \nWard wrote a memoir about this experience. It's called Testimony: Inside the Evangelical Movement That Failed a Generation.\nI wanted to understand what that choice to step away looked like, and the consequences of living with it. \nWard's story begins with his parents. They were spiritual seekers. His dad had been a Catholic, his mom a disenchanted Presbyterian, and they were looking for something more.\n\n                Ward with his parents, circa 1980.\n                \n                    \n                    Jon Ward\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nJon Ward: My parents were both caught up in something called the Jesus Movement or the Jesus...[Content truncated]",
