We have the Chega movement doing well in Portugal, with the young especially. In Germany, the ultraright-wing Alternative for Germany surged in last month’s European parliamentary elections. In France, Marine Le Pen’s populist party also triumphed in the European election, a result that prompted President Emmanuel Macron to call new national elections and throw the entire French political system into meltdown. In the U.K.’s forthcoming national elections, Nigel Farage’s Reform Party is on pace to win seats for the first time. So if you’re a historian telling the big story of what’s happening, what would it be? What’s the core narrative here?_\nSTEVE BANNON: Well, I think it’s very simple: that the ruling elites of the West lost confidence in themselves. The elites have lost their faith in their countries. They’ve lost faith in the Westphalian system, the nation-state. They are more and more detached from the lived experience of their people.\n to read as many articles as you like.\nDavid Brooks is an Opinion columnist for The Times, writing about political, social and cultural trends. \nA version of this article appears in print on July 7, 2024, Section SR, Page 12 of the New York edition with the headline: How Steve Bannon Sees the Future.  |  | \nAdvertisement",

But I grew up in a college town in Northern California in the 1980s, where the ubiquitous Grateful Dead stickers, crystal shops and tarot card readers suggested that the 1960s ethos of self-discovery never ended. Psychedelic accoutrements and people who self-identified as seekers were normal to me — and so I craved mainstream American culture. I rebelled — mildly — by eating Domino’s pizza at sleepovers and idolizing the nihilism of 1970s punk.\nIt turns out that I didn’t entirely resist it. In the past decade or so, my fluency in the world of New Age culture, wellness, woo-woo (whatever you might call it) became a professional boon as a journalist. These ideas were taking off once again, especially among women who are White and middle-class, which I also am. I understood that world and had a lot to say about it. While on assignment I’ve gone to menstrual huts and tea ceremonies; I’ve gotten massaged by boa constrictors and I’ve meditated at sound baths. I’ve greeted this all with professional curiosity, something between an open mind and a world-weary arched eyebrow.\nOn Jan. 6...[Content truncated]",

From John F. Kennedy’s having to assure a convention of ministers in 1960 that he would not be making policy according to secret brainwaves directed at him from the Vatican, to the highly profitable embrace between movement conservative politics and what once was known as the religious right, to watching Barack Obama invite Rick Warren to bless his first inauguration, we’ve allowed more than a little incense to filter into the profane corridors of political power.\nAs we have done so, I have become increasingly convinced that Madison had the right idea—that organized religion should be kept out of the secular government for the same reasons that we keep toddlers away from cutlery. At this point, the spirituality of a political candidate is little more than another issue paper, a talking point to be massaged, one line on your professional CV, along with your law degree and your devotion to the flag and puppies. One is obliged now to render to Caesar and to God in similar currencies.\nSooner or later, if you make religion a mandatory exercise in the selection of a secular official, you are going to find yourself ruled either by a liar or a faker. Performance piety is much easier to fake than actual piety and less liable to turn people off. Enter, then, the world of _The Faith of Donald J. Trump_, a new book by David Brody, the chief political correspondent for the Christian Broadcasting Network, and Scott Lamb, a Baptist minister and the vice president of Liberty University, the Christian institution founded by the late Jerry Falwell in 1971.\nTo the casual observer, it would appear that Brody and Lamb set themselves a heroic task. By all available evidence, Donald Trump is the most thoroughgoing heathen we’ve ever installed in the White House. There are seven deadly sins in the church of my birth and over the course of his life, Trump has wrung the bell loudly and publicly on at least six of them—lust, gluttony, greed, wrath, envy, and pride. (Nobody ever would attribute sloth to him. After all, he’s always worked incredibly hard committing the other six.) He is more of a hound than JFK, eats worse than William Howard Taft, grabs for gold more enthusiastically than did Grant’s entire Cabinet, erupts in unbridled rage over things he sees on television more often than late-period LBJ, boils over perceived slights more heatedly than Nixon, and has an opinion of himself that makes Andy Jackson look like a Poor Clare. Religion has been as much in evidence in Donald Trump’s public life as vegetables...[Content truncated]",

Yes, they wanted me to have a religious education. But they also wanted to know that, for at least six hours a day, I'd be in a place that reflected their own Christian values. Values they believed would make me a better person, and would keep me safe from the temptations and moral depravity of the secular world. \nIn fifth grade, they moved me to the public school, and it felt just totally wild to me. I could wear pants instead of dresses. Kids talked back to teachers, and the really bad kids wrote curse words on the back of the seats on the bus. I remember saying a prayer for one of them because I was convinced that he was damned to hell after that. \nIt was definitely a transition, but I figured out how to navigate myself outside of my little Baptist school bubble. And at that time, it's what my parents intended. They knew I had to learn how to operate in the real world – full of people with different values and perspectives and life experiences. \nJon Ward grew up in a more isolating corner of Christianity. He was raised in an evangelical church in the D.C. area that defined his life, his friends, his family – his whole identity. He was taught never to question the teachings of the Bible, or the judgment of the men who led his church. And he was discouraged from ever engaging in the world outside his religious community.\nWard had other plans though. After college, he decided to pursue a career in journalism. It was a choice that would fracture his family. Through his work as a political journalist, Ward learned how to interrogate assumptions, how to question authority, and eventually that meant questioning the church he grew up in — and leaving it altogether. \nWard wrote a memoir about this experience. It's called Testimony: Inside the Evangelical Movement That Failed a Generation.\nI wanted to understand what that choice to step away looked like, and the consequences of living with it. \nWard's story begins with his parents. They were spiritual seekers. His dad had been a Catholic, his mom a disenchanted Presbyterian, and they were looking for something more.\n\n                Ward with his parents, circa 1980.\n                \n                    \n                    Jon Ward\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nJon Ward: My parents were both caught up in something called the Jesus Movement or the Jesus...[Content truncated]",

I’m one of them.\nPolitical affiliation played no role in my decision. I’m a registered Democrat who often votes Republican. I was raised in an Orthodox Jewish family in North Jersey. We cried when Richard Nixon defeated Hubert Humphrey in 1968 and exulted when Ronald Reagan routed Jimmy Carter in 1980.\nThis year poses a fresh dilemma.\nPresident Trump has proven himself as a consistent supporter of Israel. We feel an affinity to the president’s cadre of Orthodox Jewish advisers, including Jared Kushner. Jared’s father, Charlie, was my high school classmate at the Jewish Educational Center in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The Kushners wore their commitment to Jewish causes and Israel on their sleeves.\nI also became professionally acquainted with Joe Biden in the 1980s, interviewing him at length when he was Delaware’s junior senator and I served as news director at WDOV-Radio in Dover, Delaware. I always found Biden well-versed in both domestic and foreign policy, with nuanced views on the issues. We’ve lost contact over the years, but no one can convince me Biden’s morphed into a reckless socialist.\nI’m only one man, one vote.

When was it that you first started to really think about global warming in your life?**\n_Many, many years ago, although I can’t remember exactly when it first hit home.

It was encouraged massively by the arrival of Donald Trump into the political landscape, his views on climate change and his decision to pull the US out of the Paris Accord in particular I am a great believer in climate change and the threat it poses for the future of the world and so his ignorance is especially worrying. In recent years the reality of climate change has become increasingly worrying and so I saw the success of the Paris agreement as an incredible moment, when almost the entire world agreed and was willing to do something noble. Then Trump arrived. It...[Content truncated]",

Trump explores his rarely discussed, but deeply important, religious beliefs and relationships with leading Evangelicals.\nThe Chief Political Correspondent for the Christian Broadcasting Network and the \"Jesus in the Public Square\" columnist for the Washington Times explore the rarely discussed, but deeply important, religious beliefs and worldview of Donald J. Trump and his advisors.\nDonald J. Trump was raised as a Presbyterian and has praised both Christianity and the primacy of the Bible. In the Oval Office, he has surrounded himself with close advisors who share his deep faith. In this deeply reported book, David Brody and Scott Lamb draw on unparalleled access to the White House to explain President Trump’s connection to the Christian faith, the evangelical right, the prosperity gospel, and the pressing moral and ethical issues of our day.\nIn part, the authors argue, President Trump won over evangelicals not by pandering to them, but by supporting them and all their most important issues without pretending to be something he’s not. Though the forty-fifth president is far from the perfect vessel—he has been married three times—his supporters argue that Donald Trump may be just what America needs.
