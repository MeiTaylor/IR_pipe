We have the Chega movement doing well in Portugal, with the young especially. In Germany, the ultraright-wing Alternative for Germany surged in last month’s European parliamentary elections. In France, Marine Le Pen’s populist party also triumphed in the European election, a result that prompted President Emmanuel Macron to call new national elections and throw the entire French political system into meltdown. In the U.K.’s forthcoming national elections, Nigel Farage’s Reform Party is on pace to win seats for the first time. So if you’re a historian telling the big story of what’s happening, what would it be? What’s the core narrative here?_\nSTEVE BANNON: Well, I think it’s very simple: that the ruling elites of the West lost confidence in themselves. The elites have lost their faith in their countries. They’ve lost faith in the Westphalian system, the nation-state.

From John F. Kennedy’s having to assure a convention of ministers in 1960 that he would not be making policy according to secret brainwaves directed at him from the Vatican, to the highly profitable embrace between movement conservative politics and what once was known as the religious right, to watching Barack Obama invite Rick Warren to bless his first inauguration, we’ve allowed more than a little incense to filter into the profane corridors of political power.\nAs we have done so, I have become increasingly convinced that Madison had the right idea—that organized religion should be kept out of the secular government for the same reasons that we keep toddlers away from cutlery. At this point, the spirituality of a political candidate is little more than another issue paper, a talking point to be massaged, one line on your professional CV, along with your law degree and your devotion to the flag and puppies. One is obliged now to render to Caesar and to God in similar currencies.\nSooner or later, if you make religion a mandatory exercise in the selection of a secular official, you are going to find yourself ruled either by a liar or a faker. Performance piety is much easier to fake than actual piety and less liable to turn people off. Enter, then, the world of _The Faith of Donald J. Trump_, a new book by David Brody, the chief political correspondent for the Christian Broadcasting Network, and Scott Lamb, a Baptist minister and the vice president of Liberty University, the Christian institution founded by the late Jerry Falwell in 1971.\nTo the casual observer, it would appear that Brody and Lamb set themselves a heroic task. By all available evidence, Donald Trump is the most thoroughgoing heathen we’ve ever installed in the White House. There are seven deadly sins in the church of my birth and over the course of his life, Trump has wrung the bell loudly and publicly on at least six of them—lust, gluttony, greed, wrath, envy, and pride. (Nobody ever would attribute sloth to him. After all, he’s always worked incredibly hard committing the other six.) He is more of a hound than JFK, eats worse than William Howard Taft, grabs for gold more enthusiastically than did Grant’s entire Cabinet, erupts in unbridled rage over things he sees on television more often than late-period LBJ, boils over perceived slights more heatedly than Nixon, and has an opinion of himself that makes Andy Jackson look like a Poor Clare.

But when it comes to Trump’s personal qualities and conduct, many express mixed feelings. Even among this strongly supportive constituency, most do not view Trump as a _very_ religious, honest or morally upstanding person (though many white evangelicals say he is _somewhat_ religious, _fairly_ honest or _fairly_ morally upstanding).\nMore broadly, the survey finds that U.S. adults prize a president who lives a moral and ethical life more than they care about having one who is religious. More than six-in-ten Americans say it is “very important” to them to have a president who personally lives a moral and ethical life. By comparison, just one-in-five say it is very important for a president to have strong religious beliefs, and even fewer respondents think it is vital for the president to share their own religious beliefs.\nOn the whole, Americans care more about having a president who stands up for their religious beliefs than having one who personally shares those beliefs. Roughly seven-in-ten say it is either very (38%) or somewhat (31%) important to have a president who stands up for people with their religious beliefs.\n]\nWhite evangelical Protestants are particularly likely to hold this view. Two-thirds of white evangelicals say it is very important to have a president who stands up for their religious beliefs, about double the share who say it is very important for a president to have strong religious beliefs. And white evangelicals say Trump fits the bill: Fully eight-in-ten white evangelical Protestants say that the phrase “fights for what I believe in” describes Trump “very well” or “fairly well,” including roughly half who say this describes him “very well.”\nMoreover, white evangelical Protestants overwhelmingly feel that the Trump administration has helped (59%) rather than hurt (7%) the interests of evangelical Christians. And three-quarters of white evangelicals say they agree with the president on “many,” “nearly all” or “all” important issues facing the country.\n]\nWhile white evangelical Protestants generally see Trump as standing up for them, they are less convinced that he personally lives a moral and ethical life or conducts himself admirably. Just 15% of white evangelicals say the phrase “morally upstanding” describes Trump very well, and about a quarter say “honest” is a very good descriptor of the president (23%). About one-third of white evangelicals (31%) say they like the way Trump conducts himself as president (aside from his positions on the issues). Fully two-thirds either have “mixed feelings...[Content truncated]",

            "content": "[Content truncated]... a church would be “a religious establishment by law.” As the years have gone by, though, we have strayed from Madison’s wise admonition. From John F. Kennedy’s having to assure a convention of ministers in 1960 that he would not be making policy according to secret brainwaves directed at him from the Vatican, to the highly profitable embrace between movement conservative politics and what once was known as the religious right, to watching Barack Obama invite Rick Warren to bless his first inauguration, we’ve allowed more than a little incense to filter into the profane corridors of political power.\nAs we have done so, I have become increasingly convinced that Madison had the right idea—that organized religion should be kept out of the secular government for the same reasons that we keep toddlers away from cutlery. At this point, the spirituality of a political candidate is little more than another issue paper, a talking point to be massaged, one line on your professional CV, along with your law degree and your devotion to the flag and puppies. One is obliged now to render to Caesar and to God in similar currencies.\nSooner or later, if you make religion a mandatory exercise in the selection of a secular official, you are going to find yourself ruled either by a liar or a faker. Performance piety is much easier to fake than actual piety and less liable to turn people off. Enter, then, the world of _The Faith of Donald J. Trump_, a new book by David Brody, the chief political correspondent for the Christian Broadcasting Network, and Scott Lamb, a Baptist minister and the vice president of Liberty University, the Christian institution founded by the late Jerry Falwell in 1971.\nTo the casual observer, it would appear that Brody and Lamb set themselves a heroic task. By all available evidence, Donald Trump is the most thoroughgoing heathen we’ve ever installed in the White House. There are seven deadly sins in the church of my birth and over the course of his life, Trump has wrung the bell loudly and publicly on at least six of them—lust, gluttony, greed, wrath, envy, and pride. (Nobody ever would attribute sloth to him. After all, he’s always worked incredibly hard committing the other six.) He is more of a hound than JFK, eats worse than William Howard Taft, grabs for gold more enthusiastically than did Grant’s entire Cabinet, erupts in unbridled rage over things he sees on television more often than late-period LBJ, boils over perceived slights more heatedly than Nixon, and has an opinion of himself that makes Andy Jackson look like a Poor Clare.

    "QA": {
        "Question": "What evidence exists to support or refute claims about Donald Trump's religious beliefs during his interviews in the 1980s?",
        "Answer": "The evidence regarding Donald Trump's religious beliefs during his interviews in the 1980s suggests that claims about him identifying as an atheist are unfounded. 1. **Lack of Evidence for Claims**: A widely circulated meme claimed that Trump told Phil Donahue in 1989 that he was too smart to believe in God, stating, “I have a really high IQ, Phil. I mean, c'mon. It's impossible for me to not be Atheist.” However, fact-checking organizations like Snopes found no evidence that Trump ever made such a statement or even appeared on The Phil Donahue Show in 1989. Trump's actual guest appearance on the show occurred in 1987, during which he did not discuss his religious beliefs at all, indicating that the claims about him being an atheist are likely fabrications [Query2_evidence_1]. 2. **Historical Context**: Trump's views on religion have been variously portrayed, but during the 1980s, he did not explicitly identify himself with atheism in any public forum. The meme that claims he did lacks credibility, as it is based on a false quote disseminated without proper sourcing [Query2_evidence_1]. 3. **Public Perception**: While Trump has expressed views claiming that people are tired of being taken advantage of, this sentiment does not directly address or support any specific religious beliefs or atheism. The absence of any religious discussions in his interview from 1987 reinforces the idea that he did not make any declarations regarding atheism [Query 1_evidence1]. Based on this analysis, I can confidently state that the evidence strongly refutes the claims about Donald Trump's atheism rooted in the 1980s interviews, showing that he did not make any such declarations during that period.",
