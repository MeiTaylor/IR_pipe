Baker III was U.S. secretary of state from 1989 to 1992.\nI vividly remember the time and place when I knew that the Cold War had ended. It was Aug. 3, 1990, at Vnukovo II Airport outside Moscow. I stood shoulder to shoulder with the foreign minister of the Soviet Union as history was made when we jointly declared our countries' opposition to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and called for an arms embargo on Iraq, then a Soviet client state. My counterpart was Eduard Shevardnadze. While he was an adversary, he was also a trusted diplomatic partner. In time, he would become a close friend. My biases should therefore be clear: I liked and admired the man.\nBut I believe that history, too, will judge Shevardnadze kindly. For the Cold War could not have ended peacefully without him. He helped shepherd the Soviet Union, Europe and, indeed, the world through a period of profound and unpredictable change. Looking back, it is easy to say that the Soviet empire would inevitably have collapsed with a whimper, not a bang. But there was nothing inevitable about it.\nA staunch supporter of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of reform, Shevardnadze struggled mightily against powerful domestic forces with a vested interest in sustaining ruthless repression at home and permanent Cold War abroad....[Content truncated]",

And it's kind of nice that I can say here -- if one of them asked me -- it ended in a tie game. \\\nAt the risk of sounding facetious, I just want to say here in this room -- and as has been so eloquently stated by the people who've spoken already -- about the uniqueness of how all of us, from so many different heritages, have come together here in the name of that one man. I have long been unable to understand the atheist in this world of so much beauty. And I've had an unholy desire to invite some atheists to a dinner and then serve the most fabulous gourmet dinner that has ever been concocted and, after dinner, ask them if they believe there was a cook. \\\nBut I want to thank each of you for being here today and for sharing with us the spiritual message that God has placed in your hearts. God's love shines through every word. His truth is the ultimate power source, and it's always there. It's available to ministers of the Gospel, Presidents, and the local grocery clerk.

And so, in the name of the family itself, I urge you to join me in doing your part in local, State, and national politics. And with regard to voting, I like to paraphrase Will Rogers. He pointed out that people holding public office are no better or worse than the people who voted for them to send them there. But he said they're all better than those who don't vote at all. So, if this democracy of ours is to be preserved, we must all exercise our precious right to vote.\nFinally, in this age when electronics beam messages around the globe in a few seconds, we must work to separate half-truths from the whole truth, including the truth about the difference between free and totalitarian societies. Today there are profound changes underway in the Communist world. My trip to Moscow convinced me of that. And of all the changes underway, perhaps none holds more hope for the future than Mr. Gorbachev's statements that the Soviet Union would soon grant its believers certain new freedoms. But while we pray for those inside the Communist world, we must cherish the freedoms that we already enjoy, cherish a nation founded in freedom. Just think of those words we recited a few moments ago. The Pledge of Allegiance asserts that our nation is under God -- an unthinkable statement in too many countries around the world today. And it proclaims the ideals of liberty and justice, ideals that we may not have completely achieved but that as a free people we're constantly striving toward.\nIf I could interject here something. You know, I know in our land of freedom everyone -- if they want to choose atheism instead of a belief in God, that's their right to do so. But I have always felt that I would like someday to entertain an atheist at dinner and serve the most gourmet, perfect dinner that has ever been served and then, at the end of the meal, ask that atheist if he believes there's a cook. We must cherish our nation, work to make her better still, and never stop saying this simple prayer: God bless America.\nPermit me to close now on a personal note with a few thoughts from my heart. You know, hardly a day goes by that I'm not told -- sometimes in letters, sometimes by people I meet -- that they're praying for me. It's a warm but humbling feeling. I know that many of you pray probably for me and for all our government leaders....[Content truncated]",

I\u00a0had just graduated from college. My mother died just before  came out. She knew I was an actor but she never saw me become successful.\n**Had my Dad lived**, I might have done something different with my life. When he died it was a very destabilising experience for me in ways I can't even explain. He was a very powerful figure, president of Yale University, a professor of English renaissance literature, very academic; super-charismatic; solid. And then he moved into the administration of major league baseball, so it was a very curious sort of career trajectory. He died just like that. A heart attack at 50. His death threw everybody for a big loop.\n**I had just graduated from Yale** \u2013 in English \u2013 and thought about going into academic life, though I don't think I would have been suited to it. It is because my dad died suddenly that I became an actor. I thought, I'm going to make money doing this thing I enjoy.\n**Home was New Haven,...[Content truncated]",

But when it comes to Trump\u2019s personal qualities and conduct, many express mixed feelings. Even among this strongly supportive constituency, most do not view Trump as a _very_ religious, honest or morally upstanding person (though many white evangelicals say he is _somewhat_ religious, _fairly_ honest or _fairly_ morally upstanding).\nMore broadly, the survey finds that U.S. adults prize a president who lives a moral and ethical life more than they care about having one who is religious. More than six-in-ten Americans say it is \u201cvery important\u201d to them to have a president who personally lives a moral and ethical life. By comparison, just one-in-five say it is very important for a president to have strong religious beliefs, and even fewer respondents think it is vital for the president to share their own religious beliefs.\nOn the whole, Americans care more about having a president who stands up for their religious beliefs than having one who personally shares those beliefs. Roughly seven-in-ten say it is either very (38%) or somewhat (31%) important to have a president who stands up for people with their religious beliefs.\n]\nWhite evangelical Protestants are particularly likely to hold this view. Two-thirds of white evangelicals say it is very important to have a president who stands up for their religious beliefs, about double the share who say it is very important for a president to have strong religious beliefs. And white evangelicals say Trump fits the bill: Fully eight-in-ten white evangelical Protestants say that the phrase \u201cfights for what I believe in\u201d describes Trump \u201cvery well\u201d or \u201cfairly well,\u201d including roughly half who say this describes him \u201cvery well.\u201d\nMoreover, white evangelical Protestants overwhelmingly feel that the Trump administration has helped (59%) rather than hurt (7%) the interests of evangelical Christians. And three-quarters of white evangelicals say they agree with the president on \u201cmany,\u201d \u201cnearly all\u201d or \u201call\u201d important issues facing the country.\n]\nWhile white evangelical Protestants generally see Trump as standing up for them, they are less convinced that he personally lives a moral and ethical life or conducts himself admirably. Just 15% of white evangelicals say the phrase \u201cmorally upstanding\u201d describes Trump very well, and about a quarter say \u201chonest\u201d is a very good descriptor of the president (23%). About one-third of white evangelicals (31%) say they like the way Trump conducts himself as president (aside from his positions on the issues).

While Murray O\u2019Hair is not widely known outside of the US, she had an extraordinary life. Long before the likes of Richard Dawkins, she gained notoriety for helping to push bible readings out of schools, and in 1963 she founded American Atheists. It\u2019s a group that is still going today, campaigning against Donald Trump\u2019s plan to abolish the rule that forbids religious institutions, among other charitable organisations, from getting involved in political activity and funding). For the next few decades, Murray O\u2019Hair devoted her life to campaigning against the church\u2019s power. She was a contentious figure, and  along with her son and granddaughter from their home in Austin, Texas, that too was controversial.\nPeople wondered whether there could be a sinister explanation. With still no sign of the family eight months on,  suggested that there were \u201ctwo widely discussed explanations about the disappearances\u201d. The first was that the trio had gone on the run with money they\u2019d embezzled from the organisation. \u201cThe other,\u201d they reported, \u201cis that Mrs O\u2019Hair, 77, diabetic and in declining health, was taking action on her desire to die without others praying over her corpse.\u201d\nNeither proved to be true: in 2001, their bodies were found, dismembered and hidden on a ranch in Texas, not murdered by one of the many enemies Murray O\u2019Hair had made (death threats were common and she had been physically attacked), but by a former employee at American Atheists and two accomplices.
