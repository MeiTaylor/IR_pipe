Within a decade or so, the last will be dead and that astonishing feat will pass from living memory into history, which, sooner or later, is always questioned and turned into fable. It will not be exactly like the moment the last conquistador died, but will lean in that direction. The story of the moon landing will become a little harder to believe.\nI’ve met three of the twelve men who walked on the moon. They had one important thing in common when I looked into their eyes: they were all bonkers. Buzz Aldrin, who was the second off the ladder during the first landing on July 20, 1969, almost exactly fifty years ago—he must have stared with envy at Neil Armstrong’s crinkly space-suit ass all the way down—has run hot from the moment he returned to earth. When questioned about the reality of the landing—he was asked to swear to it on a Bible—he slugged the questioner. When I sat down with Edgar Mitchell, who made his landing in the winter of 1971, he had that same look in his eyes. I asked about the space program, but he talked only about UFOs. He said he...[Content truncated]",

While most research conducted thus far on this topic has taken place in Western societies (mostly the US and Western Europe), conspiracy theories are by no means exclusive to these societies. Quantitative research has found evidence for widespread conspiracy beliefs in countries around the world, including Poland (Golec de Zavala & Cichocka, ), Ukraine (Chayinska & Minescu, ), Malaysia (Swami, ), Indonesia (Mashuri & Zaduqisti, ), and the Muslim world in the Middle East (Gentzkow & Shapiro, ). Ethnographic studies have found substantial conspiracy theorizing in rural Africa (e.g., Namibia; Tanzania) where people endorse a range of conspiracy theories that implicate societal elites, that accuse enemy tribes of witchcraft, or that involve malpractice of the Western world. For instance, many citizens in these regions believe that modern technology is a form of sorcery designed by hostile Western plots to harm or control them (West & Sanders, ). Relatedly, anthropologists have observed conspiracy theories among the Yanomamö Amazon Indians in South America, who sometimes blame the mysterious death of a tribe member on sorcery committed by a conspiracy of an enemy village (Chagnon, ).\nFinally, conspiracy theories emerge across a wide variety of social settings. Conspiracy theories commonly accuse governmental institutions (e.g., politicians in general, or secret service agencies), and entire branches of industry (e.g., the pharmaceutical industry; the oil industry) of malpractice. Furthermore, conspiracy theories often accuse minority groups, such as Muslims or Jews, of hostile plots to plan a revolution (Pipes, ). But conspiracy theories also occur in more micro‐level settings. Several studies have revealed that conspiracy theories are common in organizations, where employees suspect their managers of conspiring towards evil goals (e.g., conspiracy theories that managers have a hidden agenda to lay off employees, in order to give themselves a financial bonus; see Douglas & Leite, ; Van Prooijen & De Vries, ). Although research on the variety of settings in which people believe conspiracy theories is scarce at present, we suspect that conspiracy theories are prevalent also in other domains of social life such as sports (e.g., suspicions that the opposing team bribed the referee, or that supporters of the opposing team plan riots), schools (e.g., suspicions among high‐school students that teachers conspire against them to make exams more difficult), and so on. In any setting characterized by psychological tensions between competing (sub‐)groups, conspiracy theories are likely to occur.\n### Principle 3...[Content truncated]",

The most notable claim of these conspiracy theories is that the six crewed landings (1969–1972) were faked and that twelve Apollo astronauts did not actually land on the Moon. Various groups and individuals have made claims since the mid-1970s that NASA and others knowingly misled the public into believing the landings happened, by manufacturing, tampering with, or destroying evidence including photos, telemetry tapes, radio and TV transmissions, and Moon rock samples.\n\nMuch third-party evidence for the landings exists, and detailed rebuttals to the hoax claims have been made.[1] Since the late 2000s, high-definition photos taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) of the Apollo landing sites have captured the Lunar Module descent stages and the tracks left by the astronauts.[2][3] In 2012, images were released showing five of the six Apollo missions' American flags erected on the Moon still standing. The exception is that of Apollo 11, which has lain on the lunar surface since being blown over by the Lunar Module Ascent Propulsion System.[4][5]\n\nDespite the fact that they are demonstrably false[6] and universally regarded as pseudoscience, opinion polls taken...[Content truncated]",

Specific epistemic motives that causal explanations may serve include slaking curiosity when information is unavailable, reducing uncertainty and bewilderment when available information is conflicting, finding meaning when events seem random, and defending beliefs from disconfirmation. Relevant to these motives, conspiracy theories have attributes that set them apart from other types of causal explanation. Albeit to varying degrees, they are speculative in that they posit actions that are hidden from public scrutiny, complex in that they postulate the coordination of multiple actors, and resistant to falsification in that they postulate that conspirators use stealth and disinformation to cover up their actions—implying that people who try to debunk conspiracy theories may, themselves, be part of the conspiracy (). A related property of conspiracy theories is that they can protect cherished beliefs (e.g., vaccination is harmful; climate change is not a serious concern) by casting overwhelmingly disconfirmatory evidence (e.g., scientific findings) as the product of a conspiracy ().\nIn general, empirically warranted (vs. speculative), parsimonious (vs. complex), and falsifiable explanations are stronger according to normative standards of causal explanation (e.g., in science; see ). However, conspiracy theories appear to provide broad, internally consistent explanations that allow people to preserve beliefs in the face of uncertainty and contradiction. In keeping with this analysis, research suggests that belief in conspiracy theories is stronger when the motivation to find patterns in the environment is experimentally heightened (). It is also stronger among people who habitually seek meaning and patterns in the environment, including believers in paranormal phenomena (e.g., ; but see ). It also appears to be stronger when events are especially large in scale or significant and leave people dissatisfied with mundane, small-scale explanations (). Furthermore, the need for cognitive closure is associated with beliefs in salient conspiracy theories for events that lack clear official explanations (). Also, research suggests that conspiracy belief is stronger when people experience distress as a result of feeling uncertain ().\nOur analysis suggests that conspiracy theories may satisfy some epistemic motives at the expense of others—for example, by shielding beliefs from uncertainty while being less likely to be accurate. The epistemic drawbacks of conspiracy theories do not seem to be readily apparent to people who lack the ability or motivation to think critically and rationally. Conspiracy belief is correlated with lower levels of analytic thinking () and lower levels of education (). It is also associated with the tendency to overestimate the likelihood of co-occurring events () and the tendency to perceive agency and intentionality where it does...[Content truncated]",

To determine this, Dr Grimes analysed data from three genuine collusions.\nThe first was the surveillance program conducted by the US National Security Agency (NSA), known as...[Content truncated]",

Although these claims were false and easily debunked, they have persisted to this day.\nMost of the deniers' “proof” is based on perceived anomalies in the images transmitted back to Earth from the moon's lunar surface. “With few exceptions, the same arguments just keep coming up over and over again,” says , the press officer for the American Astronomical Society, who holds a PhD in astronomy. He has some first-hand knowledge of this: nearly 40 years ago, Fienberg debated one of the first prominent moon landing deniers, Bill Kaysing, on TV.\nApollo 11: JFK’s Secret Space Tapes\nThe initial claims the moon landing was staged came at a time when the  and  had  in their government.

It also causes tides, somehow, for some reason, though if you're looking for an in-depth explanation as to how it does this and why, you are encouraged to look elsewhere. To top it all off, in all of human history, only 12 people have actually been to the moon and experienced it firsthand; for context, this is less than the number of kids in the Duggar family.\r\n\r\nWith all of this in mind, it's unsurprising that the moon would generate so many myths and conspiracy theories. For centuries, people have posited such batty ideas as the moon is made of cheese, or that women's menstrual cycles are affected by the lunar cycle (it is not, and they are not). And while you would think that us actually landing on the moon 50 years ago would curb these theories, it has not. If anything, speculation about the moon has ramped up in the decades years since Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Third ",
