And there is a fluttering effect because the weak gravity on the Moon is not strong enough to uncrumple the flag. After a little waving while the astronauts planted the flags into the Moon’s surface, they have remained still ever since.\n### Fried by radiation\nPerhaps the most convincing argument that the landings were faked has to do with something called the Van Allen belts. These are two giant doughnut-shaped belts surrounding the Earth. They are made of highly energetic charged particles from the solar wind. Some people believe humans couldn’t have passed through these belts without being exposed to lethal doses of radiation.\nThis was a genuine concern before the Apollo missions. And it is the reason scientists behind Apollo 11 made sure they protected the astronauts as best they could. They insulated the spacecraft from radiation with an aluminium shell. And they chose a trajectory from the Earth to the Moon which minimised the amount of time spent in the Van Allen belts.\nReadings from the nine Apollo missions that reached the Moon showed the astronauts’ average radiation exposure was 0.46 radiation-absorbed dose (rad). This proved Nasa was right to shield the astronauts from radiation. Though it’s less than that experienced by some nuclear energy workers, 0.46 rad is around 10 times more than the radiation exposure of medical professionals who routinely work with x-ray and radiotherapy machines.\n### Proof we walked on the Moon\nOf course, until we return to the Moon there will always be anomalies and oddities in the records that can spark new claims that the Moon landings were faked. But it is the sheer size and variety of this record that proves every one of these claims to be false.\nFrom the Apollo Moon missions, there are 8,400 publicly available photos, thousands of hours of video footage, a mountain of scientific data, and full transcripts and audio recordings of all air-to-ground conversations. We even have 382 kilograms of Moon rock that Apollo astronauts brought back to Earth. These rocks have been independently verified as lunar by laboratories around the world, ruling out a US conspiracy.\nIf this is not enough to convince the most-hardened sceptic, Nasa’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) might sway them. Today, LRO takes high resolution pictures of the lunar surface from a low orbit. During its mission, it has captured the landing sites and the abandoned descent modules and rovers from the Apollo missions. And its resolution is so good it has picked up the dark squiggly paths that the astronaut’s footprints made. Spacecraft from China, India and Japan have also spotted these...[Content truncated]",

That day, an estimated 530 million TV viewers watched U.S. astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin take their first steps on the moon. Afterward, the two men and third crew member Michael Collins flew safely back to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean. \nYet just a few years later, some people claimed the “giant leap for mankind” had been faked. Conspiracy theories that the moon landing was actually a hoax that the U.S. government had staged to win the space race with the Soviets began to gain traction in the mid-1970s. Although these claims were false and easily debunked, they have persisted to this day. \nMost of the deniers' “proof” is based on perceived anomalies in the images transmitted back to Earth from the moon's lunar surface. “With few exceptions, the same arguments just keep coming up over and over again,” says Rick Fienberg, the press officer for the American Astronomical Society, who holds a PhD in astronomy. He has some first-hand knowledge of this: nearly 40 years ago, Fienberg debated one of the first prominent moon landing deniers, Bill Kaysing, on TV. \nThe initial claims the moon landing was staged came at a time when the Pentagon Papers and Watergate had eroded Americans’ trust in their government. But faking the success of the Apollo 11 mission would require deception on a grand scale—and would be practically impossible to pull off, says Fienberg. \n“About 400,000 scientists, engineers, technologists, machinists, electricians, worked on the Apollo program,” Fienberg points out. “If in fact the main motivation for believing in the moon hoax that is you don’t trust the government, you don’t trust our leaders, you don’t trust authority, how can you feel that 400,000 people would keep their mouths shut for ...[Content truncated]",

Various groups and individuals have made claims since the mid-1970s that NASA and others knowingly misled the public into believing the landings happened, by manufacturing, tampering with, or destroying evidence including photos, telemetry tapes, radio and TV transmissions, and Moon rock samples.\n\nMuch third-party evidence for the landings exists, and detailed rebuttals to the hoax claims have been made.[1] Since the late 2000s, high-definition photos taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) of the Apollo landing sites have captured the Lunar Module descent stages and the tracks left by the astronauts.[2][3] In 2012, images were released showing five of the six Apollo missions' American flags erected on the Moon still standing. The exception is that of Apollo 11, which has lain on the lunar surface since being blown over by the Lunar Module Ascent Propulsion System.[4][5]\n\nDespite the fact that they are demonstrably false[6] and universally regarded as pseudoscience, opinion polls taken in various locations between 1994 and 2009 have shown that between 6% and 20% of Americans, 25% of Britons, and 28% of Russians surveyed believe that the crewed landings were faked. Even as late as 2001, the Fox television network documentary Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon? claimed NASA faked the first landing in 1969 to win the Space Race.[7]\n\nAn early and influential book about the subject of a Moon...[Content truncated]",

(: NASA/Apollo 8)\nSome of the greatest and most eye-opening photos, stories, and quotes came back from those trips, including some from Apollo 8’s Bill Anders, who took not only the famous “Earthrise” photo that was sent around the world in late 1968, but also a series of photos showing the Earth rising over the limb of the Moon, as illustrated above. Anders described the journey to the Moon as follows:\n“You could see the flames and the outer skin of the spacecraft glowing; and burning, baseball-size chunks flying off behind us. It was an eerie feeling, like being a gnat inside a blowtorch flame.”\n!\nSome of the deployed scientific equipment taken to the Moon during the Apollo 12 mission, where the installation and operation of this equipment was well-documented both remotely and in situ by the astronauts who installed it.

Did you know that we brought up a large amount of scientific equipment and installed it on the lunar surface during the Apollo missions?\n*   Lunar seismometers were installed by Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16, with the most advanced ones transmitting data to Earth until 1977.\n*   Apollo 11 installed the lunar laser ranging retroreflector array, which is still operational today, allowing us to reflect lasers off of it and measure the Earth-Moon distance to ~centimeter precision. (We also use Apollo 14, 15, and the Soviet Lunokhud 2 rover for this.)\n*   The SWC experiment, to measure the solar wind composition from the Moon’s surface.\n*   The SWS experiment to measure the solar wind’s spectra from the Moon.\n*   The LSM experiment to measure the lunar magnetic field.\n*   The LDD to measure how lunar dust would settle on and pollute solar panels.\nAnd many others. That we have the data from these experiments, and that the lunar retroreflectors are still in use today, represents some pretty strong evidence that we did, in fact, land on the Moon.\n!\nThis image, from January 31, 1971, shows sunrise from Alan Shepard’s 12 o’clock pan taken near the Lunar Module at the start of EVA-1 (moonwalk).

Second, the Van Allen belts collect charged ionizing radiation types, and surprisingly enough, the charged ionizing radiation types actually tend to be fairly easily blocked, ranging from not being able to penetrate human skin to needing a fraction of an inch of plastic. They also like saying we didn’t know about the Van Allen belts at the time, which is more hokum, since Van Allen announced the discovery in 1958, years before man reached space.\nThe hoax advocates tend to assume that if there’s two ways to interpret a statement, that the only correct way to interpret it is the way that supports their position, or to just flat out take quotes out of context. An example of this would be when they quote  where he talks about a mission to the Moon would require a large rocket, larger than the Saturn V. The thing is, this was in the 50’s and von Braun was advocating for , which would in fact require a much larger rocket than  would, which is what von Braun changed to advocating for in 1962. This would also be why NASA decided to go with LOR rather than direct ascent or  which would have required multiple smaller craft.\nHoax advocates like passing around bogus claims even after they’ve been shown to be bogus. Bart Sibrel did a “documentary” claiming to show a smoking gun video that proves that the moon missions were faked. The smoking gun video was so bad it inspired me to start a blog, and I did a post specifically on that video, showing that his explanations as to how they faked the video were impossible even if you took the video at face value, but that’s rather hard to do when the video is actually edited together from other publicly available NASA footage that if you check the actual source, thoroughly disproves Sibrel’s claims. It’s been dissected before, but here’s where I got into it: . You’ll still see people insisting that this documentary will change your opinion if you watch it with an open mind.\nHoax advocates also like assuming that their “common sense” is fact and applies everywhere. Moon dust behaves nothing like what we commonly refer to as dust, it would probably be closer to beach sand than dust, and even then the comparison isn’t a particularly good one, so no, how they expect things to work based on their experience on Earth doesn’t necessarily apply to alien environments.\nUpvote ·\n9917\n91\nRelated questions\nMore answers below\n]\nLives in The United States of America · Author has 9.7K answers and ...[Content truncated]",

The Apollo 11 moon landing was the realization of President John F. Kennedy’s vision, stated in an address to a joint session of Congress on May 25, 1961, that the United States “should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth.” Kennedy appealed to national pride when requesting that Congress fund the effort, adding, “But in a very real sense, it will not be one man going to the moon—we make this judgment affirmatively—it will be an entire nation. For all of us must work to put him there.” Prominently portrayed at the center of Cox’s mural, the U.S. flag signals the importance of U.S. government support and investment in making the endeavor a success.\n]\nVIDEO: The 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing was the realization of President John F.

Armstrong presented the other flag, which had flown over the House of Representatives wing of the Capitol, to Speaker John McCormack.

Then the Soviets would have made it to the Moon first.\nApollo 8 was designed to confound that, and it did.\nIn early December 1968, in fact, the rivalry remained alive enough that _Time_ magazine did a cover story on it. “Race for the Moon” was the headline, and the cover was an illustration of an American astronaut and a Soviet cosmonaut, in spacesuits, leaping for the surface of the Moon.\nSeven months later, when Apollo 11, with Michael Collins, Neil Armstrong, and Buzz Aldrin aboard, entered orbit around the Moon on July 19, 1969, there was a Soviet spaceship there to meet them. It was Luna 15, and it had been launched a few days before Apollo 11. Its goal: Land on the Moon, scoop up Moon rocks and dirt, and then dash back to a landing in the Soviet Union before Collins, Aldrin, and Armstrong could return with their own Moon rocks.\nIf that had happened, the Soviets would at least have been able to claim that they had gotten Moon rocks back to Earth first (and hadn’t needed people to do it).\nSo put aside for a moment the pure ridiculousness of a Moon landing conspiracy that somehow doesn’t leak out. More than 410,000 Americans worked on Apollo, on behalf of . Was their work fake? Were they all in on the conspiracy? And then, also, all their family members—more than 1 million people—not one of whom ever whispered a word of the conspiracy?\nWhat of the reporters? Hundreds of reporters covering space, writing stories not just of the dramatic moments, but about all the local companies making space technology, from California to Delaware.\nPut aside as well the thousands of hours of audio recordings—between spacecraft and mission control; in mission control, where dozens of controllers talked to each other; in the spacecraft themselves, where there were separate recordings of the astronauts just talking to each other in space. There were 2,502 hours of Apollo spaceflight, more than 100 days. It’s an astonishing undertaking not only to script all that conversation, but then to get people to enact it with authenticity, urgency, and emotion. You can now listen to all of it online, and it would take you many years to do so.\nFor those who believe the missions were fake, all that...[Content truncated]",

FILE PHOTO  \n**ISTANBUL**\nA former chief of Russian space agency Roscosmos has voiced doubt over the authenticity of the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing.\n“About 10 years ago, when I worked in the government, I sent an official request to Roscosmos to provide me with documentary evidence of the Americans' stay on the moon,” Dmitry Rogozin said in a statement on Telegram on Sunday.\nRogozin said that he was “embarrassed” about the return of Soviet cosmonauts from space expeditions barely able to stand on their feet and undergoing long recoveries, while US astronauts crawled out of their lunar ships, in his words, “like cucumbers from the garden.”\nRogozin further said that he continued to search for evidence on the US landings on the Moon while working at Roscosmos, but said he could not find anything other than the “angry accusations” of some academics who claimed that he undermined Russia’s “sacred cooperation with NASA.”\nRogozin also said he received a call from a high-ranking official accusing him of \"aggravating the international situation\" with his doubts about the Apollo 11 landing.\n“I did not undermine or aggravate anything, but only by virtue of my nature I tried to get to the bottom of the details and establish, at least for myself, the true state of affairs in the issue of exploration of the Moon by our competitors. It was not clear to me how the United States, at that level of technological development of the ‘60s in the last century, did what they still cannot do now,” Rog...[Content truncated]",

To some, that was clearly an oversight made by Hollywood producers who forgot there wouldn't be any wind blowing on the lunar surface.\nDespite all scientific evidence debunking the aforementioned suggestions, various conspiracy theories about the moon landing have lingered for five decades, even before the dark underbelly of the internet became home to so many similarly false ideas.\n!\nThis NASA file image, dated July 20, 1969, shows one of the first footprints of Apollo 11 astronaut Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin on the moon.\nNASA via Reuters\nNASA has tried its best to tamp down on moon-landing conspiracy theories through the years. The organization's efforts, much like the theories themselves, didn't start immediately after Apollo 11 landed on the moon in 1969.\n\"There was basically no prominent belief, or widespread belief … in the moon landing conspiracy theory until the late 1970s,\" said Jack Singal, a University of Richmond physics professor who discusses conspiracy theories in his science classes.\nSingal pointed to the book \"We Never Went to the Moon,\" which was self-published in 1974 by Bill Kaysing, a former engineer who's since died.\n\"That was the first kind of salvo in this, and it was very gradual in comparison, again, to other prominent conspiracy theories,\" Singal said.\nSpeculation about the moon landing in the late 1970s came at a time when trust in government was starting to dip.\n!\nAstronaut Buzz Aldrin, lunar module pilot for Apollo 11, poses for a photograph besides the United States flag...[Content truncated]",
