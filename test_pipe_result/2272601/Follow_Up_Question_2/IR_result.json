It’s a little over eight years since the flights of Gagarin and Shepard, followed quickly by President Kennedy’s challenge to put a man on the moon before the decade is out.\nIt is only seven months since NASA’s made a bold decision to send  all the way to the moon on the first manned flight of the massive Saturn V rocket.\nNow, on the morning of July 16,  astronauts ,  and  sit atop another Saturn V at Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center. The three-stage 363-foot rocket will use its 7.5 million pounds of thrust to propel them into space and into history.\nAt 9:32 a.m. EDT, the engines fire and Apollo 11 clears the tower. About 12 minutes later, the crew is in Earth orbit. ()\nAfter one and a half orbits, Apollo 11 gets a “go” for what mission controllers call “Translunar Injection” – in other words, it’s time to head for the moon. Three days later the crew is in lunar orbit. A day after that, Armstrong and Aldrin climb into the lunar module _Eagle_ and begin the descent, while Collins orbits in the command module _Columbia_.\n]\nApollo 11 Commander Neil Armstrong working at an equipment storage area on the lunar module. This is one of the few photos that show Armstrong during the moonwalk. Click image to enlarge.\nNASA\nCollins later writes that _Eagle_ is “the weirdest looking contraption I have ever seen in the sky,” but it will prove its worth.\nWhen it comes time to set _Eagle_ down in the Sea of Tranquility, Armstrong improvises, manually piloting the ship past an area littered with boulders. During the final seconds of descent, _Eagle’s_ computer is sounding alarms.\nIt turns out to be a simple case of the computer trying to do too many things at once, but as Aldrin will later point out, “unfortunately it came up when we did not want to be trying to solve these particular problems.”\n]\nSmoke and flames signal the opening of a historic journey as the Saturn V clears the launch pad.

They beat the Baltimore Orioles, four games to one.\nBut how do you know that? How can you be sure? After all, up until 1969, the Mets were a terrible team. They won the fewest games in the major leagues in 1967, and the third-fewest in 1968. It seems very unlikely they could have won the championship the very next year.\nWhat if someone said that it didn’t happen? That the Mets instead lost the series to the Orioles?

And there is a fluttering effect because the weak gravity on the Moon is not strong enough to uncrumple the flag. After a little waving while the astronauts planted the flags into the Moon’s surface, they have remained still ever since.\n### Fried by radiation\nPerhaps the most convincing argument that the landings were faked has to do with something called the Van Allen belts. These are two giant doughnut-shaped belts surrounding the Earth. They are made of highly energetic charged particles from the solar wind. Some people believe humans couldn’t have passed through these belts without being exposed to lethal doses of radiation.\nThis was a genuine concern before the Apollo missions. And it is the reason scientists behind Apollo 11 made sure they protected the astronauts as best they could. They insulated the spacecraft from radiation with an aluminium shell. And they chose a trajectory from the Earth to the Moon which minimised the amount of time spent in the Van Allen belts.\nReadings from the nine Apollo missions that reached the Moon showed the astronauts’ average radiation exposure was 0.46 radiation-absorbed dose (rad). This proved Nasa was right to shield the astronauts from radiation. Though it’s less than that experienced by some nuclear energy workers, 0.46 rad is around 10 times more than the radiation exposure of medical professionals who routinely work with x-ray and radiotherapy machines.\n### Proof we walked on the Moon\nOf course, until we return to the Moon there will always be anomalies and oddities in the records that can spark new claims that the Moon landings were faked. But it is the sheer size and variety of this record that proves every one of these claims to be false.\nFrom the Apollo Moon missions, there are 8,400 publicly available photos, thousands of hours of video footage, a mountain of scientific data, and full transcripts and audio recordings of all air-to-ground conversations. We even have 382 kilograms of Moon rock that Apollo astronauts brought back to Earth. These rocks have been independently verified as lunar by laboratories around the world, ruling out a US conspiracy.\nIf this is not enough to convince the most-hardened sceptic, Nasa’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) might sway them. Today, LRO takes high resolution pictures of the lunar surface from a low orbit. During its mission, it has captured the landing sites and the abandoned descent modules and rovers from the Apollo missions. And its resolution is so good it has picked up the dark squiggly paths that the astronaut’s footprints made. Spacecraft from China, India and Japan have also spotted these...[Content truncated]",

Relive some of these historic moments by reading the below quotes from the astronauts who helped make history.\n!\n### FIX YOUR LITTLE PROBLEM AND LIGHT THIS CANDLE.\nAlan Shepard\nAfter several delays and sitting in the Freedom 7 Mercury capsule for four hours, astronaut Alan Shepard was ready to launch. On May 5th, 1961, he launched aboard the Mercury-Redstone 3, becoming the first American to fly into space. Project Mercury led to many breakthroughs in NASA’s understanding of spaceflight. NASA learned how to put people in orbit, how to fly a spacecraft and that people could live and work in space. Project Mercury paved the way for launching more humans into space in the Apollo, Space Shuttle and Commercial Crew Programs.\n_Fun fact:_ A Mercury-Redstone 3 rocket, like the one that launched America to space for the first time, is on display in the .\n!\n### THAT’S ONE SMALL STEP FOR MAN, ONE GIANT LEAP FOR MANKIND.\nNeil Armstrong\nNot even seven years after President John F. Kennedy made the challenge to put a man on the Moon, astronaut Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins launched aboard a Saturn V rocket to do just that. Four days after their launch, Armstrong and Aldrin climbed into the lunar module Eagle to begin their descent to the Moon. At 4:17 PM, EDT on July 20th, 1969, the Eagle landed. Six hours later, as Armstrong began climbing down the ladder he proclaimed “”. On July 24th, when the Apollo 11 crew safely splashed down near Hawaii, President Kennedy’s challenge had been met. Humans had taken the next step in space exploration, by taking a step on the Moon.\n_Fun fact:_ View a recreation of this important moment in time at the Apollo/Saturn V Center.

They beat the Baltimore Orioles, four games to one.\nBut how do you know that? How can you be sure? After all, up until 1969, the Mets were a terrible team. They won the fewest games in the major leagues in 1967, and the third-fewest in 1968. It seems very unlikely they could have won the championship the very next year.\nWhat if someone said that it didn’t happen? That the Mets instead lost the series to the Orioles? That the claim the Mets won is just a hoax, a canard, a fake story?\nIs it possible to...[Content truncated]"

And there is a fluttering effect because the weak gravity on the Moon is not strong enough to uncrumple the flag. After a little waving while the astronauts planted the flags into the Moon’s surface, they have remained still ever since.\n### Fried by radiation\nPerhaps the most convincing argument that the landings were faked has to do with something called the Van Allen belts. These are two giant doughnut-shaped belts surrounding the Earth. They are made of highly energetic charged particles from the solar wind. Some people believe humans couldn’t have passed through these belts without being exposed to lethal doses of radiation.\nThis was a genuine concern before the Apollo missions. And it is the reason scientists behind Apollo 11 made sure they protected the astronauts as best they could. They insulated the spacecraft from radiation with an aluminium shell. And they chose a trajectory from the Earth to the Moon which minimised the amount of time spent in the Van Allen belts.\nReadings from the nine Apollo missions that reached the Moon showed the astronauts’ average radiation exposure was 0.46 radiation-absorbed dose (rad). This proved Nasa was right to shield the astronauts from radiation. Though it’s less than that experienced by some nuclear energy workers, 0.46 rad is around 10 times more than the radiation exposure of medical professionals who routinely work with x-ray and radiotherapy machines.\n### Proof we walked on the Moon\nOf course, until we return to the Moon there will always be anomalies and oddities in the records that can spark new claims that the Moon landings were faked. But it is the sheer size and variety of this record that proves every one of these claims to be false.\nFrom the Apollo Moon missions, there are 8,400 publicly available photos, thousands of hours of video footage, a mountain of scientific data, and full transcripts and audio recordings of all air-to-ground conversations. We even have 382 kilograms of Moon rock that Apollo astronauts brought back to Earth. These rocks have been independently verified as lunar by laboratories around the world, ruling out a US conspiracy.\nIf this is not enough to convince the most-hardened sceptic, Nasa’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) might sway them. Today, LRO takes high resolution pictures of the lunar surface from a low orbit. During its mission, it has captured the landing sites and the abandoned descent modules and rovers from the Apollo missions. And its resolution is so good it has picked up the dark squiggly paths that the astronaut’s footprints made. Spacecraft from China, India and Japan have also spotted these...[Content truncated]"

Space Station has begun a new era of space exploration for the United States, marking the return of humans launching from American soil after the Space Shuttle Program ended in 2011.\nThe milestone missions that have defined human’s exploration of space have often begun with a launch from right here at Kennedy Space Center. Relive some of these historic moments by reading the below quotes from the astronauts who helped make history.\n!\n### FIX YOUR LITTLE PROBLEM AND LIGHT THIS CANDLE.\nAlan Shepard\nAfter several delays and sitting in the Freedom 7 Mercury capsule for four hours, astronaut Alan Shepard was ready to launch. On May 5th, 1961, he launched aboard the Mercury-Redstone 3, becoming the first American to fly into space. Project Mercury led to many breakthroughs in NASA’s understanding of spaceflight. NASA learned how to put people in orbit, how to fly a spacecraft and that people could live and work in space. Project Mercury paved the way for launching more humans into space in the Apollo, Space Shuttle and Commercial Crew Programs.\n_Fun fact:_ A Mercury-Redstone 3 rocket, like the one that launched America to space for the first time, is on display in the .\n!\n### THAT’S ONE SMALL STEP FOR MAN, ONE GIANT LEAP FOR MANKIND.\nNeil Armstrong\nNot even seven years after President John F. Kennedy made the challenge to put a man on the Moon, astronaut Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins launched aboard a Saturn V rocket to do just that. Four days after their launch, Armstrong and Aldrin climbed into the lunar module Eagle to begin their descent to the Moon. At 4:17 PM, EDT on July 20th, 1969, the Eagle landed. Six hours later, as Armstrong began climbing down the ladder he proclaimed “”. On July 24th, when the Apollo 11 crew safely splashed down near Hawaii, President Kennedy’s challenge had been met. Humans had taken the next step in space exploration, by taking a step on the Moon.\n_Fun fact:_ View a recreation of this important moment in time at the Apollo/Saturn V Center. The  shows a scene from Apollo 11 when Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong planted the American flag on the lunar surface. This exhibit includes the Lunar Module 9 (LM-9), an authentic lunar module created for the Apollo Program.\n!\n### HOUSTON, WE’VE HAD A PROBLEM HERE.\nJohn “Jack” Swigert & James “Jim” Lovell\nOften called the “successful failure”, the Apollo 13 mission is a testament to NASA’s commitment to bringing their astronauts back home safely....[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What credentials and perspectives do the speakers in the video have on the authenticity of the moon landing?",
        "Answer": "The speakers in the video 'In the Shadow of the Moon: Were the Moon Landings Faked?' carry significant credentials and expertise, particularly in the field of astrophysics and space exploration, which informs their perspectives on the authenticity of the moon landing.\n\n1. **Expertise of Notable Figures**: One of the primary speakers is Stephen Hawking, a globally recognized theoretical physicist known for his work in cosmology and quantum gravity. His status as an expert in physics lends considerable authority to his statements regarding the implausibility of conspiracy theories surrounding the moon landing. Hawking argues that significant historical events attract conspiracy theories, but maintaining a conspiracy involving thousands of individuals over decades without any leaks is highly improbable. This perspective underscores the scientific rigor behind his belief in the authenticity of the moon landings.\n\n2. **Historical Context and Repetition of Missions**: The speaker also emphasizes that the United States successfully landed astronauts on the moon nine times, rhetorically questioning why it would make sense to fake the landings multiple times if indeed they were faked. This repetition serves as a strong argument against conspiracy theories, illustrating the consistent achievement of NASA and supporting the validity of the lunar missions.\n\n3. **Scientific Validation**: Throughout the video, the speakers refer to the physical evidence collected from the moon landings, including scientific studies and the lunar rocks brought back to Earth. These rocks have been independently verified by laboratories globally, forming an essential part of the compelling evidence that confirms the missions were genuine. The verification process by various independent scientific entities adds credibility to the claims made by the speakers, reinforcing their argument for authenticity.\n\n4. **Practical Impossibility of Conspiracy**: There is a focus on the statistical and practical impossibility of maintaining a conspiracy at such a scale, which is supported by evidence suggesting that large-scale conspiracies tend to unravel quickly, especially over long periods. This perspective draws on historical and mathematical analyses that reinforce the credibility of the moon landings against the backdrop of conspiracy theories.\n\nIn summary, the credentials of the speakers — particularly their expertise in physics and the context of their arguments regarding the repeat successes of lunar missions — provide a robust defense against the claims that the moon landing was faked.",
