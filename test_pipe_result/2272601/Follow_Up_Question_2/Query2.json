Conspiracy theories about the event dating back to the 1970s are in fact more popular than ever. A common theory is that film director Stanley Kubrick helped NASA fake the historic footage of its six successful moon landings.\nBut would it really have been possible to do that with the technology available at the time? \nI’m not a space travel expert, an engineer or a scientist. I am a filmmaker and lecturer in film post-production, and – while I can’t say how we landed on the moon in 1969 – I can say with some certainty that the footage would have been impossible to fake.\nHere are some of the most common beliefs and questions – and why they don’t hold up.\nThere are two different ways of capturing moving images. One is film, actual strips of photographic material onto which a series of images are exposed. Another is video, which is an electronic method of recording onto various mediums, such as moving magnetic tape. With video, you can also broadcast to a television receiver. A standard motion picture film records images at 24 frames per second, while broadcast television is typically either 25 or 30 frames, depending on where you are in the world.\nREAD MORE: How many people does it take to keep a conspiracy alive?\nIf we go along with the idea that the moon landings were taped in a TV studio, then we would expect them to be 30 frames per second video, which...[Content truncated]",

And there is a fluttering effect because the weak gravity on the Moon is not strong enough to uncrumple the flag. After a little waving while the astronauts planted the flags into the Moon’s surface, they have remained still ever since.\n### Fried by radiation\nPerhaps the most convincing argument that the landings were faked has to do with something called the Van Allen belts. These are two giant doughnut-shaped belts surrounding the Earth. They are made of highly energetic charged particles from the solar wind. Some people believe humans couldn’t have passed through these belts without being exposed to lethal doses of radiation.\nThis was a genuine concern before the Apollo missions. And it is the reason scientists behind Apollo 11 made sure they protected the astronauts as best they could. They insulated the spacecraft from radiation with an aluminium shell. And they chose a trajectory from the Earth to the Moon which minimised the amount of time spent in the Van Allen belts.\nReadings from the nine Apollo missions that reached the Moon showed the astronauts’ average radiation exposure was 0.46 radiation-absorbed dose (rad). This proved Nasa was right to shield the astronauts from radiation. Though it’s less than that experienced by some nuclear energy workers, 0.46 rad is around 10 times more than the radiation exposure of medical professionals who routinely work with x-ray and radiotherapy machines.\n### Proof we walked on the Moon\nOf course, until we return to the Moon there will always be anomalies and oddities in the records that can spark new claims that the Moon landings were faked. But it is the sheer size and variety of this record that proves every one of these claims to be false.\nFrom the Apollo Moon missions, there are 8,400 publicly available photos, thousands of hours of video footage, a mountain of scientific data, and full transcripts and audio recordings of all air-to-ground conversations. We even have 382 kilograms of Moon rock that Apollo astronauts brought back to Earth. These rocks have been independently verified as lunar by laboratories around the world, ruling out a US conspiracy.\nIf this is not enough to convince the most-hardened sceptic, Nasa’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) might sway them. Today, LRO takes high resolution pictures of the lunar surface from a low orbit. During its mission, it has captured the landing sites and the abandoned descent modules and rovers from the Apollo missions. And its resolution is so good it has picked up the dark squiggly paths that the astronaut’s footprints made. Spacecraft from China, India and Japan have also spotted these...[Content truncated]",

Amidst all of the hoopla virtually every news story, especially in the electronic world, made some comment about a supposedly rising belief that humans have never landed on the Moon.  Why?\n \nOf course, from almost the point of the first Apollo missions, a small group of Americans have denied that it had taken place. This group seems to be expanding as the events of Apollo recede into history. Aided by a youth movement that does not remember what went down in the Apollo era and for whom distrust of government runs high, it is among that cadre of Americans where those who are skeptical have proliferated. Jaded by so many other government scandals, these younger members of society whose recollection of Apollo is distant to begin with finds it easy to believe the questioning they see on myriad Moon hoax web sites. Lack of understanding of science and failure to employ critical analytical skills make them more susceptible to this type of hucksterism. There has been considerable research on the parts of society that embrace conspiracy theories of all types. Arguing that conspiracism writ large represents a fundamental part of the political system, legal scholar Mark Fenster claims in Conspiracy Theories: Secrecy and...[Content truncated]",

Photos have been faked and manipulated for nearly as long as photography has existed.\nNow, not even reality is required for photographs to look authentic — just artificial intelligence responding to a prompt. Even experts sometimes struggle to tell if one is real or not. Can you?\nWhich image was created by artificial intelligence? Click on your guess\nThe rapid advent of artificial intelligence has set off alarms that the technology used to trick people is advancing far faster than the technology that can identify the tricks. Tech companies, researchers, photo agencies and news organizations are scrambling to catch up, trying to establish standards for content provenance and ownership.\nThe advancements are already fueling disinformation and being used to stoke political divisions. Authoritarian governments have created seemingly realistic news broadcasters to advance their political goals. Last month, some people fell for images showing Pope Francis donning a puffy Balenciaga jacket and an earthquake devastating the Pacific Northwest, even though neither of those events had occurred. The images had been created using Midjourney, a popular image generator.\nOn Tuesday, as former President Donald J. Trump turned himself in at the Manhattan district attorney’s office to face criminal charges, images generated by artificial intelligence appeared on Reddit showing the actor Bill Murray as president in the White House. Another image showing Mr. Trump marching in front of a large crowd with American flags in the background was quickly reshared on Twitter without the disclosure that had accompanied the original post, noting it was not actually a photograph.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Space Station has begun a new era of space exploration for the United States, marking the return of humans launching from American soil after the Space Shuttle Program ended in 2011.\nThe milestone missions that have defined human’s exploration of space have often begun with a launch from right here at Kennedy Space Center. Relive some of these historic moments by reading the below quotes from the astronauts who helped make history.\n!\n### FIX YOUR LITTLE PROBLEM AND LIGHT THIS CANDLE.\nAlan Shepard\nAfter several delays and sitting in the Freedom 7 Mercury capsule for four hours, astronaut Alan Shepard was ready to launch. On May 5th, 1961, he launched aboard the Mercury-Redstone 3, becoming the first American to fly into space. Project Mercury led to many breakthroughs in NASA’s understanding of spaceflight. NASA learned how to put people in orbit, how to fly a spacecraft and that people could live and work in space. Project Mercury paved the way for launching more humans into space in the Apollo, Space Shuttle and Commercial Crew Programs.\n_Fun fact:_ A Mercury-Redstone 3 rocket, like the one that launched America to space for the first time, is on display in the .\n!\n### THAT’S ONE SMALL STEP FOR MAN, ONE GIANT LEAP FOR MANKIND.\nNeil Armstrong\nNot even seven years after President John F. Kennedy made the challenge to put a man on the Moon, astronaut Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins launched aboard a Saturn V rocket to do just that. Four days after their launch, Armstrong and Aldrin climbed into the lunar module Eagle to begin their descent to the Moon. At 4:17 PM, EDT on July 20th, 1969, the Eagle landed. Six hours later, as Armstrong began climbing down the ladder he proclaimed “”. On July 24th, when the Apollo 11 crew safely splashed down near Hawaii, President Kennedy’s challenge had been met. Humans had taken the next step in space exploration, by taking a step on the Moon.\n_Fun fact:_ View a recreation of this important moment in time at the Apollo/Saturn V Center. The  shows a scene from Apollo 11 when Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong planted the American flag on the lunar surface. This exhibit includes the Lunar Module 9 (LM-9), an authentic lunar module created for the Apollo Program.\n!\n### HOUSTON, WE’VE HAD A PROBLEM HERE.\nJohn “Jack” Swigert & James “Jim” Lovell\nOften called the “successful failure”, the Apollo 13 mission is a testament to NASA’s commitment to bringing their astronauts back home safely....[Content truncated]",

How can you know that astronauts really did go to the Moon?\nLet’s address this question by putting it side by side with another stunning event of the same year: the New York Mets’ shocking win in baseball’s World Series. They beat the Baltimore Orioles, four games to one.\nBut how do you know that? How can you be sure? After all, up until 1969, the Mets were a terrible team. They won the fewest games in the major leagues in 1967, and the third-fewest in 1968. It seems very unlikely they could have won the championship the very next year.\nWhat if someone said that it didn’t happen? That the Mets instead lost the series to the Orioles?

That day, an estimated  TV viewers watched U.S. astronauts  and  take their . Afterward, the two men and third crew member Michael Collins flew safely back to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean.\nYet just a few years later, some people claimed the “giant leap for mankind” had been faked. Conspiracy theories that the moon landing was actually a hoax that the U.S. government had staged to win the  with  began to gain traction in the mid-1970s. Although these claims were false and easily debunked, they have persisted to this day.\nMost of the deniers' “proof” is based on perceived anomalies in the images transmitted back to Earth from the moon's lunar surface. “With few exceptions, the same arguments just keep coming up over and over again,” says , the press officer for the American Astronomical Society, who holds a PhD in astronomy. He has some first-hand knowledge of this: nearly 40 years ago, Fienberg debated one of the first prominent moon landing deniers, Bill Kaysing, on TV.\nApollo 11: JFK’s Secret Space Tapes\nThe initial claims the moon landing was staged came at a time when the  and  had  in their government.

The broadcast was being shown on the RAI network, the only TV channel in Italy at the time. I walked by an elettrodomimestichi shop and recognized the video instantly. I stopped, peering in the shop window. An Italian gentleman saw what I was looking at and volunteered that it was all fake, produced in Hollywood. When he heard my American accent, he added \"Otto Preminger\" just to be sure I understood him.\nOf course, I was dumbfounded. I grew up in Huntsville, Alabama where nearly everyone worked for NASA or the Army Missile Command. I had seen a prototype of the lunar rovers. I had heard the Saturn V rockets being tested for years. We had lots of local news and documentaries about the space program. The city declared itself the space capital of the universe.\nUntil a few months ago, I was greeted by a giant mural of Wernher Von Braun every time I flew into Huntsville. The rockets are all still on display at the Space and Rocket Museum, but I saw them on Redstone Arsenal before I went to Italy.\nI lectured at the Von Braun Planetarium, which had a dome made from a Saturn V liquid oxygen tank that was slightly out of spec.\nI couldn't for one moment get a grasp on how he thought it was fake. By the way, all of the slow motion special effects back in those days really were fake. They were horrible. Movie producers really did not know physics and they wouldn't know how to film it if they had known physics. Look at all the movies made in that era. If they don't look phony to you, then you probably don't understand low gravity.\nA few years later, I saw Capricorn One. I thought, uh-oh, this is going to start something.\nBy the way, that movie used a lot of real footage from Apollo because it was too hard to fake it back then.",
