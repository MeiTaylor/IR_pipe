He couldn’t defeat me at the time, but he said he needed the practice to sharpen his skills for the ROTC chess tournament at Howard University.\nI shared with him a strategy I had devised back then and he won the tournament.\nLater, when Pink Floyd had a concert at the Capital Center, in the mid 70s, I chose the seats and we went to the concert.

It’s a little over eight years since the flights of Gagarin and Shepard, followed quickly by President Kennedy’s challenge to put a man on the moon before the decade is out.\nIt is only seven months since NASA’s made a bold decision to send  all the way to the moon on the first manned flight of the massive Saturn V rocket.\nNow, on the morning of July 16,  astronauts ,  and  sit atop another Saturn V at Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center. The three-stage 363-foot rocket will use its 7.5 million pounds of thrust to propel them into space and into history.\nAt 9:32 a.m. EDT, the engines fire and Apollo 11 clears the tower. About 12 minutes later, the crew is in Earth orbit. ()\nAfter one and a half orbits, Apollo 11 gets a “go” for what mission controllers call “Translunar Injection” – in other words, it’s time to head for the moon. Three days later the crew is in lunar orbit. A day after that, Armstrong and Aldrin climb into the lunar module _Eagle_ and begin the descent, while Collins orbits in the command module _Columbia_.\n]\nApollo 11 Commander Neil Armstrong working at an equipment storage area on the lunar module. This is one of the few photos that show Armstrong during the moonwalk. Click image to enlarge.\nNASA\nCollins later writes that _Eagle_ is “the weirdest looking contraption I have ever seen in the sky,” but it will prove its worth.\nWhen it comes time to set _Eagle_ down in the Sea of Tranquility, Armstrong improvises, manually piloting the ship past an area littered with boulders. During the final seconds of descent, _Eagle’s_ computer is sounding alarms.\nIt turns out to be a simple case of the computer trying to do too many things at once, but as Aldrin will later point out, “unfortunately it came up when we did not want to be trying to solve these particular problems.”\n]\nSmoke and flames signal the opening of a historic journey as the Saturn V clears the launch pad.

Kennedy became president in January 1961, Americans had the perception that the United States was losing the \"space race\" with the Soviets. President Kennedy understood the need and had the vision of not only matching the Soviets, but surpassing them.

I've never met you in person.”\nUnfortunately, this person guessed wrong about every single paragraph: that “mopey person with a cold” was me. Another zero-for-12 listener wrote that the AI voice (actually my voice) “lacks variations in timbre and cadence.”\nA grad school friend whom I haven’t seen in years guessed wrong 11 out of 12 times. A former employee was wrong 10 out of 12 times.\nOverall, people who didn’t know me well barely did better than a coin flip, guessing correctly only 54 percent of the time. Here are the results, with the speakers identified, for you to hear yourself:\nSo my cloned voice wasn’t perfect, but it was remarkably good. And creating it was surprisingly cheap and easy.\nBack in 2020, researchers at MIT worked with a company called Respeecher to generate a  of Richard Nixon announcing the failure of the Apollo 11 Moon landing. A  shows the laborious process required to clone Nixon’s voice. The MIT researchers collected hundreds of short clips of Nixon’s voice and then had a voice actor record himself speaking the same words. The actor then read Nixon’s alternate moon landing speech and the software modified his words to sound like Nixon’s.\nThis process seems to yield excellent results: Last year, Respeecher  to clone the voice of James Earl Jones as Darth Vader in future _Star Wars_ projects. But it comes at a high cost. When I reached out to Respeecher recently to give their service a try, they informed me that “a project usually takes several weeks with fees from 4-digit to 6-digit in $USD.”\nI didn’t have thousands of dollars to spend, so I went with a little-known startup called  instead. All I had to do was upload a 30-minute video of me reading text of my choice, then wait a few hours.\nPlay.ht is a text-to-speech service, so I didn’t need to hire a voice actor. Once it had been trained on my voice, the software could generate realistic human speech from written text in just a few minutes. Best of all, I didn’t have to pay a dime. I was able to clone my voice using Play.ht’s free plan. Commercial plans start at $39 per month.\nRealistic text-to-speech systems like Play.ht are hard to build because human beings pronounce the same word differently depending on the context. We do that depending...[Content truncated]",

Brainstorm\n--------------\nLanding on the Moon and Mars is tricky. A lander headed to the Moon can go as fast as 24,816 miles (39,937 kilometers) per hour. Those on their way to Mars might go up to 13,000 miles (21,000 kilometers) per hour. To land gently, these spacecraft need to slow down before touching the surface! And if there are astronauts on board, the lander needs to keep them safe, too.\nJust as engineers develop solutions for landing different kinds of vehicles on the Moon and Mars, you can follow the engineering design process to design and build your own shock-absorbing system out of simple materials. Then, improve your design based on the results of your test landings – and test it all with code!\nFirst, consider how you will softly land your “astronauts” using the allowable materials.\n*   What kind of shock absorber can you make from these materials to help soften a landing?\n*   How will you make sure the lander doesn’t roll while falling through the air or tip over when it lands?\n* * *\nAbout the image: In this composite image from 1969, astronaut Buzz Aldrin can be seen coming down a ladder from the mission's command module (or lander).
