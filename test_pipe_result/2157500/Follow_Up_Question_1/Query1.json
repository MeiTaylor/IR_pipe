The scam letters instruct potential victims to contact the IMF for issuance of a “Certificate of International Capital Transfer” or other forms of approval to enable them to receive large sums of monies as beneficiaries. The contact e-mail information is always bogus and unsuspecting individuals are then requested to send their personal banking details, which the scammers utilize for their fraudulent activities.\nContrary to what is stated in these scam e-mails, letters, or phone conversations, the IMF does NOT authorize, verify, monitor, or assist in contract or inheritance payments between third parties and/or Governments, nor does it endorse the activities of any bank, financial institution, or other public or private agency. For purposes of clarification, the IMF is an inter-governmental organization whose transactions and operations are carried out directly with its member countries.\r\n\nIf you have already received such e-mails, you are advised to terminate all further contacts with the scammers, and, in the event that you have sent them funds, contact your local law enforcement agency immediately. If you are resident in the United States, you can also file a complaint with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), through the following  website: http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx.\nAdditional general information on scam e-mails may be found at the following website: \nhttps://home.treasury.gov/services/report-fraud-waste-and-abuse/report-scam-attempts \n",

The Program aims to develop pragmatic policy solutions that resonate with policymakers, civic leaders, and the general public. \n D i g i t a l D e c a y ? • v i i \n# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \nUntil 2016, Twitter was the online platform of choice for English-language Islamic State (IS) sympathizers. As a result of Twitter’s counter-extremism policies - includ-ing content removal - there has been a decline in activity by IS supporters. This outcome may suggest the com-pany’s efforts have been effective, but a deeper analysis reveals a complex, nonlinear portrait of decay. Such ob-servations show that the fight against IS in the digital sphere is far from over. In order to examine this change over time, this report collects and reviews 845,646 tweets produced by 1,782 English-language pro-IS ac-counts from February 15, 2016 to May 1, 2017. This study finds that: \n Twitter’s policies hinder sympathizers on the plat-form, but counter-IS practitioners should not over-state the impact of these measures in the broader fight against the organization online. \n‐ Most accounts lasted fewer than 50 days, and the network of sympathizers failed to draw the same number of followers over time. \n‐ The decline in activity by English-language IS sympathizers is caused by Twitter suspensions and IS’ strategic shift from Twitter to messag-ing platforms that offer encryption services. \n‐ Silencing IS adherents on Twitter may pro-duce unwanted side effects that challenge law enforcement’s ability to detect and disrupt threats posed by violent extremists. \n The rope connecting IS’ base of sympathizers to the organization’s top-down, central infrastruc-ture is beginning to fray as followers stray from the agenda set for them by strategic communicators. \n While IS’ battlefield initiatives are a unify-ing theme among adherents on Twitter, the organization’s strategic messaging output about these fronts receive varying degrees of attention from sympathizers. \n Terrorist attacks do little to sustain the conver-sation among supporters on Twitter, despite sub-stantive attention from IS leadership, central pro-paganda, and even Western mass media. \n‐ Over time, there has been a decline in tweets following major attacks. This suggests that at-tacks in the West have diminishing effects in mobilizing support. \n...[Content truncated]",

Share sensitive information only on official, secure websites.            \n342 Dirksen Senate Office Building\nGood morning, Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper, and distinguished Members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss my vision for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and our role in securing transportation systems through the deployment of a dedicated, well trained, professional, and effective counterterrorism workforce. I appreciate the Committee’s support of TSA’s mission to protect the nation’s transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce.\nTSA screens over 2 million passengers every day. That number is increasing rapidly, even as the terrorist threat we face grows increasingly complex and diffuse. Our Agency faces a determined enemy and a persistently evolving threat from terrorist groups around the world, exacerbated by homegrown violent extremists inspired by messages of hatred to do harm to the American people. Terrorists have long viewed the transportation sector, particularly aviation, as a leading target for attack or exploitation. That focus has not abated, as displayed by recent events including: the destruction of Metrojet Flight 9268 above the northern Sinai in October 2015, the detonation of explosives on Daallo Airlines 159 during its ascent from Adde International Airport in Mogadishu in February 2016, and the attacks at Brussels International Airport and subway system in March 2016. I was at the Brussels airport the day of the attacks and witnessed firsthand the destruction, chaos, and loss of life that came as a result of those attacks. This challenging threat environment frames all of TSA’s operations. We must address issues such as increased passenger volume, and ensure efficient screening of travelers, while maintaining focus for effective security.\nWhen I was confirmed on July 4, 2015, TSA was still working to understand the causes of the security failures identified by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) covert testing. In my tenure as Administrator, I have concentrated on improving our security operations through enhanced protocols, a retrained and refocused workforce, and efforts to drive technological improvements. Today, I look forward to discussing with you the changes we have made to enhance security.\nMy overarching priority is to fulfill the core mission of TSA; to secure the Nation’s transportation systems. To this end, my priorities are grounded in strategy and are shaped by my Administrator’s Intent, which I published in January of this year. We will focus on mission, invest in people and commit to excellence as we conduct counterterrorism operations and simultaneously mature the TSA enterprise. My Administrator’s Intent,...[Content truncated]",
