The scam letters instruct potential victims to contact the IMF for issuance of a \u201cCertificate of International Capital Transfer\u201d or other forms of approval to enable them to receive large sums of monies as beneficiaries. The contact e-mail information is always bogus and unsuspecting individuals are then requested to send their personal banking details, which the scammers utilize for their fraudulent activities.\nContrary to what is stated in these scam e-mails, letters, or phone conversations, the IMF does NOT authorize, verify, monitor, or assist in contract or inheritance payments between third parties and/or Governments, nor does it endorse the activities of any bank, financial institution, or other public or private agency. For purposes of clarification, the IMF is an inter-governmental organization whose transactions and operations are carried out directly with its member countries.\r\n\nIf you have already received such e-mails, you are advised to terminate all further contacts with the scammers, and, in the event that you have sent them funds, contact your local law enforcement agency immediately. If you are resident in the United States, you can also file a complaint with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), through the following\u00a0 website: http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx.\nAdditional general information on scam e-mails may be found at the following website: \nhttps://home.treasury.gov/services/report-fraud-waste-and-abuse/report-scam-attempts \n",

As a result of Twitter\u2019s counter-extremism policies - includ-ing content removal - there has been a decline in activity by IS supporters. This outcome may suggest the com-pany\u2019s efforts have been effective, but a deeper analysis reveals a complex, nonlinear portrait of decay. Such ob-servations show that the fight against IS in the digital sphere is far from over. In order to examine this change over time, this report collects and reviews 845,646 tweets produced by 1,782 English-language pro-IS ac-counts from February 15, 2016 to May 1, 2017. This study finds that: \n\u0083 Twitter\u2019s policies hinder sympathizers on the plat-form, but counter-IS practitioners should not over-state the impact of these measures in the broader fight against the organization online. \n\u2010 Most accounts lasted fewer than 50 days, and the network of sympathizers failed to draw the same number of followers over time. \n\u2010 The decline in activity by English-language IS sympathizers is caused by Twitter suspensions and IS\u2019 strategic shift from Twitter to messag-ing platforms that offer encryption services. \n\u2010 Silencing IS adherents on Twitter may pro-duce unwanted side effects that challenge law enforcement\u2019s ability to detect and disrupt threats posed by violent extremists. \n\u0083 The rope connecting IS\u2019 base of sympathizers to the organization\u2019s top-down, central infrastruc-ture is beginning to fray as followers stray from the agenda set for them by strategic communicators. \n\u0083 While IS\u2019 battlefield initiatives are a unify-ing theme among adherents on Twitter, the organization\u2019s strategic messaging output about these fronts receive varying degrees of attention from sympathizers. \n\u0083 Terrorist attacks do little to sustain the conver-sation among supporters on Twitter, despite sub-stantive attention from IS leadership, central pro-paganda, and even Western mass media. \n\u2010 Over time, there has been a decline in tweets following major attacks. This suggests that at-tacks in the West have diminishing effects in mobilizing support. \n\u0083...[Content truncated]",

Share sensitive information only on official, secure websites.            \n342 Dirksen Senate Office Building\nGood morning, Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper, and distinguished Members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss my vision for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and our role in securing transportation systems through the deployment of a dedicated, well trained, professional, and effective counterterrorism workforce. I appreciate the Committee\u2019s support of TSA\u2019s mission to protect the nation\u2019s transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce.\nTSA screens over 2 million passengers every day. That number is increasing rapidly, even as the terrorist threat we face grows increasingly complex and diffuse. Our Agency faces a determined enemy and a persistently evolving threat from terrorist groups around the world, exacerbated by homegrown violent extremists inspired by messages of hatred to do harm to the American people. Terrorists have long viewed the transportation sector, particularly aviation, as a leading target for attack or exploitation. That focus has not abated, as displayed by recent events including: the destruction of Metrojet Flight 9268 above the northern Sinai in October 2015, the detonation of explosives on Daallo Airlines 159 during its ascent from Adde International Airport in Mogadishu in February 2016, and the attacks at Brussels International Airport and subway system in March 2016. I was at the Brussels airport the day of the attacks and witnessed firsthand the destruction, chaos, and loss of life that came as a result of those attacks. This challenging threat environment frames all of TSA\u2019s operations. We must address issues such as increased passenger volume, and ensure efficient screening of travelers, while maintaining focus for effective security.\nWhen I was confirmed on July 4, 2015, TSA was still working to understand the causes of the security failures identified by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) covert testing. In my tenure as Administrator, I have concentrated on improving our security operations through enhanced protocols, a retrained and refocused workforce, and efforts to drive technological improvements. Today, I look forward to discussing with you the changes we have made to enhance security.\nMy overarching priority is to fulfill the core mission of TSA; to secure the Nation\u2019s transportation systems. To this end, my priorities are grounded in strategy and are shaped by my Administrator\u2019s Intent, which I published in January of this year. We will focus on mission, invest in people and commit to excellence as we conduct counterterrorism operations and simultaneously mature the TSA enterprise.

In what could amount to the deadliest attack on the army since anti-jihadist operations began in 2015, the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (JNIM) reportedly killed on 11 June over 100 soldiers in an attack on a military base in Mansila town, Yagha province, Sahel region. The following day, artillery fire hit state television headquarters near the presidential residence in the capital Ouagadougou. Although President Ibrahim Traor\u00e9 said a soldier had accidentally mishandled a weapon, unconfirmed rumours swirled that the Mansila attack had provoked an army mutiny. Attacks by security forces and jihadists causing mass civilian casualties continued.\u00a0\nWhy does it matter? The 11 June attack and rumours of growing discontent within the armed forces serve as a stark reminder of Traor\u00e9\u2019s inability to halt jihadist violence and stop Burkina Faso\u2019s downward spiral. While the military government publicly insists that it is restoring security, the massacre at Mansila, as with other deadly attacks against the army in the weeks before, illustrates that it has thus far been unable to do so. The attack has exposed and fuelled divisions within the military, leading to speculation of threats to the regime\u2019s grip on power.
