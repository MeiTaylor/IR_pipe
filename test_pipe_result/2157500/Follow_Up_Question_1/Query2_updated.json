The toll does not include three bombers who died. \nTwin blasts struck the main terminal of Zaventem international airport, in the north-east of the city. \nAnother explosion hit the Maelbeek metro station in the city centre, close to several European Union institutions.\nThis video can not be played\nBrussels explosions: Timeline of events\nThe so-called Islamic State group said it was behind the attacks.\nCCTV footage captured the three attackers shortly before two of them detonated explosives\nThe bombers have been named as follows:\nKhalid el-Bakraoui (deceased) - identified by the Belgian federal prosecutor as the suicide bomber in the metro attack. Khalid, 27, had used a false name to rent the flat in the Forest area of the Belgian capital where police killed a gunman in a shootout on 15 March.\nOsama K- Prosecutors say this man, arrested on 8 April, has been identified as the man seen with Bakraoui at the Malbeek metro station, and that he bought bags used by the attackers at Zaventem airport. He has been identified in media reports as Swedish national Osama Krayem.\nIbrahim el-Bakraoui(deceased) - one of the airport suicide bombers. Ibrahim, Khalid's brother, was identified as the central figure in the image of three suspects caught on CCTV at Zaventem airport shortly before the explosions.\nNajim Laachraoui (deceased) - The Belgian prosecutor has confirmed he was the second suicide bomber at Brussels airport. Laachraoui, pictured on the left of the CCTV image, was named last month as an accomplice of Salah Abdeslam, the main suspect in the Paris attacks in November, who was arrested in Brussels days earlier.\nMohamed Abrini - The third man in the CCTV, pictured wearing a hat, fled the airport shortly after the blast. After his arrest on 8 April, Abrini is said to have confessed \"after being confronted with the evidence\". He was already wanted by police after his fingerprints and DNA were found in two \"safe houses\" in Brussels, as well as in a car used during the Paris attacks, investigators said. \nFrom Paris to Brussels: Why the attacks are linked\nTwo explosions, moments apart, tore through the check-in area of Zaventem airport at 07:58 local time (06:58 GMT).\nOne eyewitness reported hearing shouts in Arabic just before the explosions...[Content truncated]",

All three men are seen pushing carts with bags on them.\nWith running commentary in French and Flemish, the police footage shows the third man leaving the airport after the bombs went off at 7:58 a.m. First he is walking, then he breaks into a jog.

He is wearing a light-coloured jacket, pale blue shirt and a distinctive hat.\nHe passes in front of the Sheraton hotel and leaves the airport near the Avis vehicle rental car park.\nAt some point after leaving the airport, the suspect gets rid of his jacket. He is next captured on CCTV at 08:50 at the junction of Grote Daalstraat and Chaussee de Louvain, heading towards the city centre. His shirt sleeves are rolled up.\nThe man takes the Chaussee de Louvain and is next seen on camera at the Meiser junction. \nThe suspect continues along the Chaussee de Louvain and then takes the Avenue de la Brabanconne, where he disappears at the junction with Rue du Noyer at 09:50. He is last seen wearing a light blue shirt with dark elbow patches and the hat. \nFederal prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt asked for those who \"might have filmed or taken a photograph of the suspect\" or believe they have any useful information, to call 0800 30 300 (in Belgium) or 00 32 25544488 (from abroad).\nSeparately Salah Abdeslam, the main suspect in the Paris terror attacks of 13 November, will not be extradited from Belgium to France for several more weeks, his lawyer Sven Mary has said.\nBelgian authorities want more time to question Abdeslam in connection with a 15 March shootout in Brussels during a police raid, he said.\nAccording to prosecutors, Abdeslam's fingerprints were found in the apartment where Algerian terror suspect Mohamed Belkaid was shot dead after opening fire on police.\nAbdeslam was arrested three days later in Brussels' Molenbeek neighbourhood.\nHe is believed to be the only surviving member of the group that killed 130 people in Paris last November in a series of co-ordinated attacks also claimed by so-called IS.\n'We waited 491 days': Gershkovich family welcomes huge Russia-West prisoner swap\nHow stage was set for biggest prisoner swap since Cold War\nTeen, 17, accused of Southport murders named\n'Great champion' Murray ends career with Olympic...[Content truncated]",

The decision to evacuate the Brussels metro and five rail stations was taken at 08:50 on 22 March, 52 minutes after two bombs went off at Brussels airport at 07:58. \nBut the third bomb went off at 09:11 on a metro train at Maelbeek station, in the heart of the European quarter. Metro company STIB said it had received no order from the government to halt services. The second attack was well over an hour after the first and ministers are under pressure to explain what went wrong. \nTrains were still running 21 minutes after the government had decided to evacuate the metro\nRail operators also said they had been given no direction from the government. Train services continued for some time after the third bomb and operator Infrabel only put its internal crisis plan into action at 09:45.\nThe Belgian government has said these details are speculation and questions over timings will be assessed by a parliamentary investigation committee.\nOn 15 April Transport Minister Jacqueline Galant resigned over accusations she had ignored lapses in security at Belgian airports.\nA leaked report showed weaknesses in security procedures at Belgian airports had been identified by EU inspectors in March last year.\nSixteen people...[Content truncated]",

In March I stood in front of Brussels\u2019 airport alongside similarly uncomprehending Belgian reporters.\n    \n\n            All of us are unable to understand how the specter of terror that had loomed over Belgium for so long had managed to materialize in such a sickeningly real way, and in spite of all the warnings.\n    \n\n            Turkey is of course different in some very important ways. For much of this year it has reeled from one terror attack after another.\n    \n\n            The speed of the clean-up at Istanbul Ataturk Airport is testament to a country that is all too used to putting the pieces back together as speedily and as efficiently as possible. The detonation site near the taxi drop-off point, where the blast ripped through the tarmac, wasn\u2019t easy to patch up, so instead workmen erected barriers \u2013 after hosing down the blood.\n    \n\n            The methods were eerily reminiscent of Brussels. \n    \n\n            In Istanbul, there were three attackers, one in a coat in spite of the mildness of the weather. \n    \n\n            They were so reminiscent of another three men \u2013 one the infamous \u201cman in a hat and white coat\u201d \u2013 captured on security footage in the Brussels airport attack.\n    \n\nWitness: It was like hell Turkey\u2019s array of enemies How did attackers get past security? Vengeance will be like \u2018rain from hell\u2019 Opinion: Who is behind this attack?Recent Turkey attacks: A timeline\n\nWitness: It was like hell Turkey\u2019s array of enemies How did attackers get past security? Vengeance will be like \u2018rain from hell\u2019 Opinion: Who is behind this attack?Recent Turkey attacks: A timeline\n\n            Both in Istanbul and in Brussels, the attackers targeted points of vulnerability and congregation before the security checks.\n    \n\n            But it\u2019s in the testimonies of fleeing witnesses that the similarities really hit home in an echoed litany of horror.\n    \n\n            Shattered ceiling panes slashing survivors, wreaking damage on those far from the epicenter of the blast.
