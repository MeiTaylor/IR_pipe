Share sensitive information only on official, secure websites.            \n342 Dirksen Senate Office Building\nGood morning, Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper, and distinguished Members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss my vision for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and our role in securing transportation systems through the deployment of a dedicated, well trained, professional, and effective counterterrorism workforce. I appreciate the Committee’s support of TSA’s mission to protect the nation’s transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce.\nTSA screens over 2 million passengers every day. That number is increasing rapidly, even as the terrorist threat we face grows increasingly complex and diffuse. Our Agency faces a determined enemy and a persistently evolving threat from terrorist groups around the world, exacerbated by homegrown violent extremists inspired by messages of hatred to do harm to the American people. Terrorists have long viewed the transportation sector, particularly aviation, as a leading target for attack or exploitation. That focus has not abated, as displayed by recent events including: the destruction of Metrojet Flight 9268 above the northern Sinai in October 2015, the detonation of explosives on Daallo Airlines 159 during its ascent from Adde International Airport in Mogadishu in February 2016, and the attacks at Brussels International Airport and subway system in March 2016. I was at the Brussels airport the day of the attacks and witnessed firsthand the destruction, chaos, and loss of life that came as a result of those attacks. This challenging threat environment frames all of TSA’s operations. We must address issues such as increased passenger volume, and ensure efficient screening of travelers, while maintaining focus for effective security.\nWhen I was confirmed on July 4, 2015, TSA was still working to understand the causes of the security failures identified by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) covert testing. In my tenure as Administrator, I have concentrated on improving our security operations through enhanced protocols, a retrained and refocused workforce, and efforts to drive technological improvements. Today, I look forward to discussing with you the changes we have made to enhance security.\nMy overarching priority is to fulfill the core mission of TSA; to secure the Nation’s transportation systems. To this end, my priorities are grounded in strategy and are shaped by my Administrator’s Intent, which I published in January of this year. We will focus on mission, invest in people and commit to excellence as we conduct counterterrorism operations and simultaneously mature the TSA enterprise. My Administrator’s Intent,...[Content truncated]",

He is last seen wearing a light blue shirt with dark elbow patches and the hat. \nFederal prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt asked for those who \"might have filmed or taken a photograph of the suspect\" or believe they have any useful information, to call 0800 30 300 (in Belgium) or 00 32 25544488 (from abroad).\nSeparately Salah Abdeslam, the main suspect in the Paris terror attacks of 13 November, will not be extradited from Belgium to France for several more weeks, his lawyer Sven Mary has said.\nBelgian authorities want more time to question Abdeslam in connection with a 15 March shootout in Brussels during a police raid, he said.\nAccording to prosecutors, Abdeslam's fingerprints were found in the apartment where Algerian terror suspect Mohamed Belkaid was shot dead after opening fire on police.\nAbdeslam was arrested three days later in Brussels' Molenbeek neighbourhood.\nHe is believed to be the only surviving member of the group that killed 130 people in Paris last November in a series of co-ordinated attacks also claimed by so-called IS.\n'We waited 491 days': Gershkovich family welcomes huge Russia-West prisoner swap\nHow stage was set for biggest prisoner swap since Cold War\nTeen, 17, accused of Southport murders named\n'Great champion' Murray ends career with Olympic...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What specific elements could confirm the legitimacy of the video as related to the Brussels airport attack?",
        "Answer": "To confirm the legitimacy of a video as related to the Brussels airport attack, the following specific elements could be considered:\n\n1. **Presence of Explosions**: The video should contain clear evidence of explosions occurring at the airport. The Brussels airport attack was marked by two significant blasts in the departures area, and videos capturing these moments would directly tie them to the events of March 22, 2016. Surveillance footage released after the attack showed the immediate aftermath, including chaotic scenes following explosions, which is a crucial indicator.\n\n2. **Location and Context**: The video should be set within the specific context of Zaventem International Airport, where the attacks took place. Clear identification of well-known airport landmarks or surroundings that correlate with the events reported would support the video's relevance to the attack.\n\n3. **Identification of Suspects**: If the video includes individuals or groups resembling the suspects captured on CCTV during the attack, it could enhance legitimacy. For instance, images of people pushing luggage carts, similar to those shown in the CCTV footage of the attackers, would reinforce the video's connection to the airport attack.\n\n4. **Eyewitness Accounts or Reactions**: The reactions of bystanders captured in the video could also lend credibility. Eyewitnesses reported hearing shouts in Arabic just before the explosions, which would be important to corroborate if present in the video.\n\n5. **Timing**: The timestamps in the video should align closely with the known timeline of the attacks. The first explosion at the airport occurred at 07:58 local time, so any video showing incidents before or immediately following this time would be critical in establishing its validity.\n\nBased on the arguments and the assessment of the available evidence, I would evaluate my confidence in the conclusion that the specific elements listed would confirm the legitimacy of the video as related to the Brussels airport attack at **90%**. This high level of confidence stems from the consistent references to the details of the attack in reputable sources and the distinct characteristics of the events described.",
