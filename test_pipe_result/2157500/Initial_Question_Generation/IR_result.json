Anxieties intensified about the inability to prevent mass killings at relatively unprotected places.\nAt least 30 people were killed by two blasts at the Brussels airport departure area around 8 a.m. and one in a subway station shortly after 9. The police found at least one other unexploded bomb in a search of a Brussels house hours later.\nAnd Europe’s most wanted person suddenly became an unidentified man in a white coat and dark hat seen pushing a luggage cart in an airport surveillance photo taken just before the bombings. Two other men in the photo, each wearing a black glove on his left hand, were identified by Belgian prosecutors as suspected suicide bombers who appeared to have died in the explosions.\n“To those who have chosen to be the barbaric enemies of liberty, of democracy, of fundamental values, I want to say with the greatest strength that we will remain assembled and united,” the Belgium prime minister, Charles Michel, said at a news conference Tuesday evening, declaring a three-day mourning period.\n* * *\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Anxieties intensified about the inability to prevent mass killings at relatively unprotected places.\nAt least 30 people were killed by two blasts at the Brussels airport departure area around 8 a.m. and one in a subway station shortly after 9. The police found at least one other unexploded bomb in a search of a Brussels house hours later.\nAnd Europe’s most wanted person suddenly became an unidentified man in a white coat and dark hat seen pushing a luggage cart in an airport surveillance photo taken just before the bombings. Two other men in the photo, each wearing a black glove on his left hand, were identified by Belgian prosecutors as suspected suicide bombers who appeared to have died in the explosions.\n“To those who have chosen to be the barbaric enemies of liberty, of democracy, of fundamental values, I want to say with the greatest strength that we will remain assembled and united,” the Belgium prime minister, Charles Michel, said at a news conference Tuesday evening, declaring a three-day mourning period.\n* * *\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

        "Question": "Does the Brussels airport explosion video match footage from the March 22, 2016, terrorist attack?",
        "Answer": "The claim that a video shows the \"moment the explosion\" of a terrorist attack occurred in the Brussels airport on March 22, 2016, does not match the provided video information. The video described in the \"Video_information\" section captures a busy city setting, featuring a group of people and a man running frantically through the crowd. While it includes scenes of heightened tension, it does not specifically describe an explosion or align with the known events of the Brussels airport attack, which involved bombings primarily in the departures hall, resulting in immediate chaos and devastation from explosive devices. The video instead focuses on a more general urban environment with interactions around a fire and does not indicate a direct connection to the bombings that occurred at Brussels airport, which were coordinated terror attacks causing multiple casualties and panic. The attacks were characterized by specifically targeted explosions that created immediate and widespread danger in locations that lacked any implied connection to routine urban life captured in the described footage. Reports from various news sources clearly mention that the explosions at the Brussels airport were captured on CCTV, showing the attackers and the moments leading up to and following the detonations. However, these specifics do not align with the footage described in the claim, which discusses a busy street scene and does not confirm the presence of violent explosions. Based on this analysis, I would rate my confidence in the conclusion that the video does not depict the Brussels airport explosion as 95%. The video detailed in the \"Video_information\" lacks the critical elements of the terrorist attack, which were marked by direct blasts and urgent responses from travelers after explosions, features that are notably absent in the video description provided.",
        "Confidence": "95%"
