It was too late.\nThe Belgian attack was the second in a week in Europe, following the killing of a teacher in France, by extremists well known to authorities that have highlighted the failures of complicated and bureaucratic systems put in place after a wave of terrorism in 2015 and 2016. That system is now coming under renewed scrutiny as the authorities and citizens worry about a possible reawakening of radicalism in Europe because of the war in the Middle East.\nThe cases are also likely to add fuel to renewed debates over immigration in Europe, though, in the case of the Brussels attacker, the man\u2019s history shows that Belgians of migrant background and an asylum seeker had flagged him as a risk, alerting the authorities to the suspicious behavior and troubled past, and it was the authorities who failed to act on that intelligence...[Content truncated]",

Rubin and Milan Schreuer\nBRUSSELS \u2014 As a dragnet aimed at Islamic State operatives spiraled across Brussels and into at least five European countries on Friday, the authorities were also focusing on a narrower but increasingly alarming threat: the vulnerability of Belgium\u2019s nuclear installations.\nThe investigation into this week\u2019s deadly attacks in Brussels has prompted worries that the Islamic State is seeking to attack, infiltrate or sabotage nuclear installations or obtain nuclear or radioactive material. This is especially worrying in a country with a history of security lapses at its nuclear facilities, a weak intelligence apparatus and a deeply rooted terrorist network.\nOn Friday, the authorities stripped security badges from several workers at one of two plants where all nonessential employees had been sent home hours after the attacks at the Brussels airport and one of the city\u2019s busiest subway stations three days earlier. Video footage of a top official at another Belgian nuclear facility was discovered last year in the apartment of a suspected militant linked to the extremists who unleashed the horror in Paris in November.\nAsked on Thursday at a London think tank whether there was a danger of the Islamic State\u2019s obtaining a nuclear weapon, the British defense secretary, Michael Fallon, said that \u201cwas a new and emerging threat.\u201d\nWhile the prospect that terrorists can obtain enough highly enriched uranium and then turn it into a nuclear fission bomb seems far-fetched to many experts, they say the fabrication of some kind of dirty bomb from radioactive waste or byproducts is more conceivable. There are a variety of other risks involving Belgium\u2019s facilities, including that terrorists somehow shut down the privately operated plants, which provide nearly half of Belgium\u2019s power.\nThe fears at the nuclear power plants are...[Content truncated]",

The gunman fled on a scooter and Belgium's security observatory raised its terror alert to level four or \"very serious\" \u2013 the highest \u2013 for Brussels, and level three nationally. The Belgium crisis center said on social media that a third individual had been targeted in the attack but said the person was not in a critical condition.\nBelgium's premier, Alexander De Croo, said the shooting had targeted Swedes \u2013 the attack came just before a Belgium-Sweden football match \u2013 and European leaders were quick to offer their solidarity. In a video posted on social media, a man identifying himself as the attacker said \"he was inspired by the Islamic State\" (IS) extremist group, the spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office, Eric Van Duyse, said on the LN24 news channel.\nSeveral Belgian media named the suspect as Abdesalem L, aged 45 of Tunisian origin who lived in Brussels.\n...[Content truncated]",
