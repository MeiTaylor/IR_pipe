All three men are seen pushing carts with bags on them.\nWith running commentary in French and Flemish, the police footage shows the third man leaving the airport after the bombs went off at 7:58 a.m. First he is walking, then he breaks into a jog. His face is not seen clearly in the new images.  \n**Watch video released by FedPol Belgium:**\nWe are sorry, but this feature is currently not available\nAccording to Belgian authorities, the man walked more then 10 kilometers in the ensuring hours, crossing the town of Zaventem with video finally showing him in the Schaerbeek area of Brussels, before disappearing at a crossroads at 09:50 local...[Content truncated]",

(RTL via AP)\nBRUSSELS \u2014 Bombs exploded at the Brussels airport and one of the city's metro stations Tuesday, killing at least 31 people and wounding dozens, as a European capital was again locked down amid heightened security threats. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attacks.\nThe two airport blasts, at least one of them blamed on a suicide bomber, left behind a chaotic scene of splattered blood in the departure lounge as windows were blown out, ceilings collapsed and travelers streamed out of the smoky building.\nAbout an hour later, another bomb exploded on a rush-hour subway train near the European Union headquarters. Terrified passengers had to evacuate through darkened tunnels to safety.\n!  \n#### Brussels terror attacks\n### *   \n### *   \n### *   \n### *   \n\"What we feared has happened,\" Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel told reporters. \"In this time of tragedy, this black moment for our country, I appeal to everyone to remain calm but also to show solidarity.\"\n**\\\\]**\nBelgium raised its terror alert to the highest level, diverting planes and trains and ordering people to stay where they were.

Anxieties intensified about the inability to prevent mass killings at relatively unprotected places.\nAt least 30 people were killed by two blasts at the Brussels airport departure area around 8 a.m. and one in a subway station shortly after 9. The police found at least one other unexploded bomb in a search of a Brussels house hours later.\nAnd Europe\u2019s most wanted person suddenly became an unidentified man in a white coat and dark hat seen pushing a luggage cart in an airport surveillance photo taken just before the bombings. Two other men in the photo, each wearing a black glove on his left hand, were identified by Belgian prosecutors as suspected suicide bombers who appeared to have died in the explosions.\n\u201cTo those who have chosen to be the barbaric enemies of liberty, of democracy, of fundamental values, I want to say with the greatest strength that we will remain assembled and united,\u201d the Belgium prime minister, Charles Michel, said at a news conference Tuesday evening, declaring a three-day mourning period.\n* * *\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
