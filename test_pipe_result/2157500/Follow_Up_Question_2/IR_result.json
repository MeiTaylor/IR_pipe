Two other men in the photo, each wearing a black glove on his left hand, were identified by Belgian prosecutors as suspected suicide bombers who appeared to have died in the explosions.\n“To those who have chosen to be the barbaric enemies of liberty, of democracy, of fundamental values, I want to say with the greatest strength that we will remain assembled and united,” the Belgium prime minister, Charles Michel, said at a news conference Tuesday evening, declaring a three-day mourning period.\nMaps and diagrams show the extent of the damage at the airport and subway station.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

This arrest followed the investigative procedure of the attacks that occurred on 13 November 2015 in France.\nOn 22 March 2016 at 7:58 am, two explosions occurred in the departures hall of Brussels International Airport in Zaventem, Flemish Brabant: one near Brussels Airlines reception and the other near the desk of American Airlines, where many passengers had checked their luggage for a flight to New York. The disaster plan was initiated as a result of this double explosion. The coordinating committee for threat analysis then decided to suspend all air traffic at the airport and raise the alert level to level 4 (highest level) for the entire country. Another explosion occurred at 9:11 am in the Brussels metro on a train leaving the Maelbeek station (in the European district) towards the City Centre. Following this disaster, 32 people were dead (not including the three suicide bombers) and more than 340 were wounded. Some of these wounded individuals are still undergoing heavy physical rehabilitation treatments in Belgium and neighbouring countries. In this article, we will discuss the management of bodies of people who were killed in the Zaventem Airport bombing.\nThe head of the department, on his way to a homicide investigation, was alarmed by the first announcement of the explosions at the airport on the radio at 8:15 am on Tuesday, 22 March 2016 (Day 0). At 8:16 am, the prosecutor responsible for the Brussels Airport instructed our forensic pathologist on duty to rejoin the DVI and the scientific police at the airport for crime scene investigation. At 8:20 am, we informed the coordinator of our University Hospital about the situation and activated the disaster plan designed for a catastrophe involving dozens of dead victims. The Coordinator of Forensic Medicine (the head of the department) appointed a “Recovery of Corpses” Coordinator to engage in crime scene investigation, as well as a “Forensic Identification and Mortuary” Coordinator to manage the identification process in the morgue in cooperation with the DVI postmortem (PM) Coordinator. Their duties were described in corresponding action charts according to standard the International Criminal Police Organization (...[Content truncated]",

This arrest followed the investigative procedure of the attacks that occurred on 13 November 2015 in France.\nOn 22 March 2016 at 7:58 am, two explosions occurred in the departures hall of Brussels International Airport in Zaventem, Flemish Brabant: one near Brussels Airlines reception and the other near the desk of American Airlines, where many passengers had checked their luggage for a flight to New York. The disaster plan was initiated as a result of this double explosion. The coordinating committee for threat analysis then decided to suspend all air traffic at the airport and raise the alert level to level 4 (highest level) for the entire country. Another explosion occurred at 9:11 am in the Brussels metro on a train leaving the Maelbeek station (in the European district) towards the City Centre. Following this disaster, 32 people were dead (not including the three suicide bombers) and more than 340 were wounded. Some of these wounded individuals are still undergoing heavy physical rehabilitation treatments in Belgium and neighbouring countries. In this article, we will discuss the management of bodies of people who were killed in the Zaventem Airport bombing.\nThe head of the department, on his way to a homicide investigation, was alarmed by the first announcement of the explosions at the airport on the radio at 8:15 am on Tuesday, 22 March 2016 (Day 0). At 8:16 am, the prosecutor responsible for the Brussels Airport instructed our forensic pathologist on duty to rejoin the DVI and the scientific police at the airport for crime scene investigation. At 8:20 am, we informed the coordinator of our University Hospital about the situation and activated the disaster plan designed for a catastrophe involving dozens of dead victims. The Coordinator of Forensic Medicine (the head of the department) appointed a “Recovery of Corpses” Coordinator to engage in crime scene investigation, as well as a “Forensic Identification and Mortuary” Coordinator to manage the identification process in the morgue in cooperation with the DVI postmortem (PM) Coordinator. Their duties were described in corresponding action charts according to standard the International Criminal Police Organization (...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What evidence exists to verify the video's actual location and time in relation to the Brussels airport attack?",
        "Answer": "To verify the video's actual location and time in relation to the Brussels airport attack, several key points of evidence can be referenced:\n\n1. **Specific Timing of the Explosions**: The attacks at Brussels airport occurred on March 22, 2016, with two explosions taking place at 7:58 AM in the departures hall. This precise timing is crucial for establishing a timeline that must be matched with any video footage claiming to depict the event [Query1_evidence3].\n\n2. **Content of Eyewitness Reports and Reactions**: The aftermath of the bombing was characterized by chaotic scenes as first responders arrived, and bystanders reacted in panic. Video footage linked to the bombings would need to show similar elements of immediate chaos, which would correlate directly with eyewitness accounts of events occurring just after the explosions [Query1_evidence2].\n\n3. **Geographic Location Verification**: The attacks specifically targeted the departures area of Brussels Zaventem Airport. Any video footage claiming to show this event should clearly show recognizable landmarks or features associated with that specific airport. Evidence describes the setting as near certain airline desks where the explosions took place, which would help in confirming the video's legitimacy if such identifiers are present in the footage [Query1_evidence3].\n\n4. **Existence of Surveillance Footage**: Multiple sources indicate that CCTV captured crucial moments leading up to and immediately following the attacks, which included images of the attackers and scenes of chaos just after the explosions. This highlights that genuine footage of the incidents would likely include similar elements of documented evidence captured during the attacks [Query1_evidence1].\n\n5. **Claim Verification by Authorities**: Reports by Belgian authorities have identified sequences of events during the attacks, including arrests and identifiers of the attackers, which further ground the context of any video linked to the event. If the video can be matched against these documented accounts, it would bolster validation [Query1_evidence2].\n\nBased on the alignment of these details, I would assess my confidence in the conclusion concerning the verification of the video's location and time relative to the Brussels airport attack as **85%**. This confidence level accounts for the specific referenced reporting, the centrality of timing and location in establishing a connection to the attacks, and the consistent documentation surrounding the events.",
