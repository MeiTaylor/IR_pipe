Another died in the metro attack.\nThe \"man with the hat\", as prosecutors called him, was captured pushing a trolley at Brussels airport next to the two suicide bombers in previously released CCTV footage.\nThe new footage, external shows the suspect briefly running amongst passengers as they try to escape the scene at the airport, before walking some 10km over a two-hour period.  \nHe was last seen about 40 minutes after the Maelbeek metro bombing.\nThe suspect is seen leaving the airport after the explosions.

Rubin and Milan Schreuer\nBRUSSELS \u2014 As a dragnet aimed at Islamic State operatives spiraled across Brussels and into at least five European countries on Friday, the authorities were also focusing on a narrower but increasingly alarming threat: the vulnerability of Belgium\u2019s nuclear installations.\nThe investigation into this week\u2019s deadly attacks in Brussels has prompted worries that the Islamic State is seeking to attack, infiltrate or sabotage nuclear installations or obtain nuclear or radioactive material. This is especially worrying in a country with a history of security lapses at its nuclear facilities, a weak intelligence apparatus and a deeply rooted terrorist network.\nOn Friday, the authorities stripped security badges from several workers at one of two plants where all nonessential employees had been sent home hours after the attacks at the Brussels airport and one of the city\u2019s busiest subway stations three days earlier. Video footage of a top official at another Belgian nuclear facility was discovered last year in the apartment of a suspected militant linked to the extremists who unleashed the horror in Paris in November.\nAsked on Thursday at a London think tank whether there was a danger of the Islamic State\u2019s obtaining a nuclear weapon, the British defense secretary, Michael Fallon, said that \u201cwas a new and emerging threat.\u201d\nWhile the prospect that terrorists can obtain enough highly enriched uranium and then turn it into a nuclear fission bomb seems far-fetched to many experts, they say the fabrication of some kind of dirty bomb from radioactive waste or byproducts is more conceivable. There are a variety of other risks involving Belgium\u2019s facilities, including that terrorists somehow shut down the privately operated plants, which provide nearly half of Belgium\u2019s power.\nThe fears at the nuclear power plants are...[Content truncated]",

RubinAurelien Breeden and Anita Raghavan\nBRUSSELS \u2014 Bombs packed with nails terrorized Brussels on Tuesday in the deadliest assault on the European heartland since the Islamic State\u2019s attacks on Paris four months ago, hitting the airport and subway system in coordinated strikes that were also claimed by the militant extremist group.\nThe bombings paralyzed Brussels, the headquarters of the European Union and NATO, prompted international travel warnings to avoid Belgium and reverberated across the Atlantic to the United States, where New York and other major cities raised terrorism threat levels. Anxieties intensified about the inability to prevent mass killings at relatively unprotected places.\nAt least 30 people were killed by two blasts at the Brussels airport departure area around 8 a.m. and one in a subway station shortly after 9. The police found at least one other unexploded bomb in a search of a Brussels house hours later.\nAnd Europe\u2019s most wanted person suddenly became an unidentified man in a white coat and dark hat seen pushing a luggage cart in an airport surveillance photo taken just before the bombings. Two other men in the photo, each wearing a black glove on his left hand, were identified by Belgian prosecutors as suspected suicide bombers who appeared to have died in the explosions.\n\u201cTo those who have chosen to be the barbaric enemies of liberty, of democracy, of fundamental values, I want to say with the greatest strength that we will remain assembled and united,\u201d the Belgium prime minister, Charles Michel, said at a news conference Tuesday evening, declaring a three-day mourning period.\nMaps and diagrams show the extent of the damage at the airport and subway station.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

This arrest followed the investigative procedure of the attacks that occurred on 13 November 2015 in France.\nOn 22 March 2016 at 7:58 am, two explosions occurred in the departures hall of Brussels International Airport in Zaventem, Flemish Brabant: one near Brussels Airlines reception and the other near the desk of American Airlines, where many passengers had checked their luggage for a flight to New York. The disaster plan was initiated as a result of this double explosion. The coordinating committee for threat analysis then decided to suspend all air traffic at the airport and raise the alert level to level 4 (highest level) for the entire country. Another explosion occurred at 9:11 am in the Brussels metro on a train leaving the Maelbeek station (in the European district) towards the City Centre. Following this disaster, 32 people were dead (not including the three suicide bombers) and more than 340 were wounded. Some of these wounded individuals are still undergoing heavy physical rehabilitation treatments in Belgium and neighbouring countries. In this article, we will discuss the management of bodies of people who were killed in the Zaventem Airport bombing.\nThe head of the department, on his way to a homicide investigation, was alarmed by the first announcement of the explosions at the airport on the radio at 8:15 am on Tuesday, 22 March 2016 (Day 0). At 8:16 am, the prosecutor responsible for the Brussels Airport instructed our forensic pathologist on duty to rejoin the DVI and the scientific police at the airport for crime scene investigation. At 8:20 am, we informed the coordinator of our University Hospital about the situation and activated the disaster plan designed for a catastrophe involving dozens of dead victims. The Coordinator of Forensic Medicine (the head of the department) appointed a \u201cRecovery of Corpses\u201d Coordinator to engage in crime scene investigation, as well as a \u201cForensic Identification and Mortuary\u201d Coordinator to manage the identification process in the morgue in cooperation with the DVI postmortem (PM) Coordinator. Their duties were described in corresponding action charts according to standard the International Criminal Police Organization (...[Content truncated]",
