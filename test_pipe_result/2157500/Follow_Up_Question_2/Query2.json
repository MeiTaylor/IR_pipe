The toll does not include three bombers who died. \nTwin blasts struck the main terminal of Zaventem international airport, in the north-east of the city. \nAnother explosion hit the Maelbeek metro station in the city centre, close to several European Union institutions.\nThis video can not be played\nBrussels explosions: Timeline of events\nThe so-called Islamic State group said it was behind the attacks.\nCCTV footage captured the three attackers shortly before two of them detonated explosives\nThe bombers have been named as follows:\nKhalid el-Bakraoui (deceased) - identified by the Belgian federal prosecutor as the suicide bomber in the metro attack. Khalid, 27, had used a false name to rent the flat in the Forest area of the Belgian capital where police killed a gunman in a shootout on 15 March.\nOsama K- Prosecutors say this man, arrested on 8 April, has been identified as the man seen with Bakraoui at the Malbeek metro station, and that he bought bags used by the attackers at Zaventem airport. He has been identified in media reports as Swedish national Osama Krayem.\nIbrahim el-Bakraoui(deceased) - one of the airport suicide bombers. Ibrahim, Khalid's brother, was identified as the central figure in the image of three suspects caught on CCTV at Zaventem airport shortly before the explosions.\nNajim Laachraoui (deceased) - The Belgian prosecutor has confirmed he was the second suicide bomber at Brussels airport. Laachraoui, pictured on the left of the CCTV image, was named last month as an accomplice of Salah Abdeslam, the main suspect in the Paris attacks in November, who was arrested in Brussels days earlier.\nMohamed Abrini - The third man in the CCTV, pictured wearing a hat, fled the airport shortly after the blast. After his arrest on 8 April, Abrini is said to have confessed \"after being confronted with the evidence\". He was already wanted by police after his fingerprints and DNA were found in two \"safe houses\" in Brussels, as well as in a car used during the Paris attacks, investigators said. \nFrom Paris to Brussels: Why the attacks are linked\nTwo explosions, moments apart, tore through the check-in area of Zaventem airport at 07:58 local time (06:58 GMT).\nOne eyewitness reported hearing shouts in Arabic just before the explosions...[Content truncated]",

All three men are seen pushing carts with bags on them.\nWith running commentary in French and Flemish, the police footage shows the third man leaving the airport after the bombs went off at 7:58 a.m. First he is walking, then he breaks into a jog.

The decision to evacuate the Brussels metro and five rail stations was taken at 08:50 on 22 March, 52 minutes after two bombs went off at Brussels airport at 07:58. \nBut the third bomb went off at 09:11 on a metro train at Maelbeek station, in the heart of the European quarter. Metro company STIB said it had received no order from the government to halt services. The second attack was well over an hour after the first and ministers are under pressure to explain what went wrong. \nTrains were still running 21 minutes after the government had decided to evacuate the metro\nRail operators also said they had been given no direction from the government. Train services continued for some time after the third bomb and operator Infrabel only put its internal crisis plan into action at 09:45.\nThe Belgian government has said these details are speculation and questions over timings will be assessed by a parliamentary investigation committee.\nOn 15 April Transport Minister Jacqueline Galant resigned over accusations she had ignored lapses in security at Belgian airports.\nA leaked report showed weaknesses in security procedures at Belgian airports had been identified by EU inspectors in March last year.\nSixteen people...[Content truncated]",

Authorities called him a wanted man and asked for the public’s help tracking him down.\n    \n\n            “The third man left a bomb in the airport, but it didn’t explode. … And we are now looking for this guy,” Belgium’s Interior Minister Jan Jambon said.\n    \n\n            A photograph released by investigators shows the three suspects side-by-side. \n    \n\n            Federal Prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw said the two men wearing black in the photograph were likely the suicide attackers.\n    \n\n            Video shows the men exiting a taxi and moving through the airport, according to two U.S. officials. The man dressed in white left the airport after accompanying the other two, they said – a move the officials said appeared to be planned.\n    \n\nLive blog on the Brussels attacks \n\n\n            A break in the investigation may have come from a taxi driver who took the suspects to the airport. \n    \n\n            The driver contacted authorities after seeing surveillance footage and gave them the address where he picked the men up, according to two U.S. officials briefed on the investigation.\n    \n\n            That information prompted authorities to raid a residence after the attacks, the officials said.\n    \n\n            Investigators found a nail bomb, chemical products and an ISIS flag during a house search in the northeast Brussels neighborhood of Schaerbeek, Belgium’s federal prosecutor said in a statement.\n    \n\n            Hours later, they were still combing through the building for evidence. \n    \n\n            Security was high. At one point, a helicopter hovered overhead, carrying a sniper with a weapon trained on the building.\n    \n\n            As masked, armed officers stood guard outside the building, the burst of camera flashes inside could be seen from the street below. Officers left the building carrying bags of evidence they loaded onto vehicles.\n    \n\n            A Belgian government representative told CNN that 10 people were killed and 100 wounded at Brussels’ international airport. At least 20 people died and 130 were wounded at the Maelbeek metro station, officials said. \n    \n\n            The blasts sent wounded people fleeing into...[Content truncated]",

In March I stood in front of Brussels’ airport alongside similarly uncomprehending Belgian reporters.\n    \n\n            All of us are unable to understand how the specter of terror that had loomed over Belgium for so long had managed to materialize in such a sickeningly real way, and in spite of all the warnings.\n    \n\n            Turkey is of course different in some very important ways. For much of this year it has reeled from one terror attack after another.\n    \n\n            The speed of the clean-up at Istanbul Ataturk Airport is testament to a country that is all too used to putting the pieces back together as speedily and as efficiently as possible. The detonation site near the taxi drop-off point, where the blast ripped through the tarmac, wasn’t easy to patch up, so instead workmen erected barriers – after hosing down the blood.\n    \n\n            The methods were eerily reminiscent of Brussels. \n    \n\n            In Istanbul, there were three attackers, one in a coat in spite of the mildness of the weather. \n    \n\n            They were so reminiscent of another three men – one the infamous “man in a hat and white coat” – captured on security footage in the Brussels airport attack.\n    \n\nWitness: It was like hell Turkey’s array of enemies How did attackers get past security?

Vengeance will be like ‘rain from hell’ Opinion: Who is behind this attack?Recent Turkey attacks: A timeline\n\n            Both in Istanbul and in Brussels, the attackers targeted points of vulnerability and congregation before the security checks.\n    \n\n            But it’s in the testimonies of fleeing witnesses that the similarities really hit home in an echoed litany of horror.\n    \n\n            Shattered ceiling panes slashing survivors, wreaking damage on those far from the epicenter of the blast.
