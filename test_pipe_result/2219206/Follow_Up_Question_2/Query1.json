(In 2008, an estimated 75,000 people came to see then-Sen. Barack Obama on the banks of the Willamette River as he closed in on the Democratic presidential nomination.)\nSanders is striving to harness the energy to help him in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, where his crowds have been much smaller but still relatively robust. Volunteers hand out donation envelopes to rally attendees and carefully take down their contact information so they can be solicited for money later.\nIn Los Angeles, anyone who gave on the spot received a Sanders campaign T-shirt.

He brought his Saint Bernard, Munro, to the arena, wearing a shirt that said “Saints for Sanders.”\n“I want to see a country that’s returned to the people, rather than a plutocratic oligarchy,” Jelf said. “I would like to have a planet that’s habitable for future generations.”\nJean-Luc St. Pierre, 19, said he flew from Maryland to attend the rally. He started a “Baltimore for Bernie” Facebook group targeting people in the home town of former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley, another Democratic presidential candidate.\nGloria Rios, from Eagle Rock, Calif., said she joined Sanders’s e-mail list a month ago. “I feel very strongly about him,” she said, adding that she...[Content truncated]",

Five thousand came out for his kickoff rally in his hometown of Burlington, Vermont. Another 5,000 turned out in Denver, Colorado. In Minneapolis, a thousand listened from outside after the basketball arena where Sanders was speaking filled to capacity.\nBut Madison was different.\n“Tonight we have made history,” Sanders declared to thunderous applause. “Tonight we have more people at a meeting for a candidate for president of the United States than any other candidates have.\"\nIndeed, Sanders -- the self-declared Democratic-socialist from Vermont; the former perennial protest candidate; the man who until a few weeks ago belonged to neither party -- turned out more people Wednesday night than has any candidate of either party so far this year.\n**WATCH: **\nDemocratic front-runner Hillary Clinton attracted 5,500 people, according to her campaign, to her kickoff rally in New York City, and 1,800 in Virginia last week but has otherwise not focused on large rallies. While Republican Sen. Ted Cruz had 11,000 for his launch at Liberty University, attendance was mandatory for the school's 13,000-strong student body, so it's unclear how many came of their own volition.\nIn coming to Wisconsin, Sanders tapped...[Content truncated]",

Both had retired from working as schoolteachers in South Carolina public schools—Rollins taught first grade, Hill taught high school civics—and are enjoying the good benefits that can come after a long career in the public sector.\n“The thing is, we’re doing just fine,” Rollins said in a gravely South Carolina drawl. “But too many people have this attitude, ‘I got mine, but to hell with you.’”\nIt’s a common sentiment among older voters who’ve told me they’re supporting Sanders, not because he’ll improve their lives, but because they think he has a vision for those who are younger and struggling.\n“Why wouldn’t an older citizen vote for somebody with that kind of a record?”\nPolling suggests Sanders is underperforming among South Carolina’s older voters. An NBC News/Marist survey released earlier this week showed Joe Biden crushing Sanders across the demographic. While that poll generally captured a neck and neck race between those two candidates, it found 36 percent of “baby boomers” ages 55 to 73, and 40 percent of those over 73, favoring the former vice president. Sanders, meanwhile, only got 12 and 8 percent of their support, respectively.\nMyrtle Beach could be seen as a unfriendly ground for Sanders to stump in the last days before Saturday’s South Carolina primary.
