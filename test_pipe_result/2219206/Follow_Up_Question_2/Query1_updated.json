(In 2008, an estimated 75,000 people came to see then-Sen. Barack Obama on the banks of the Willamette River as he closed in on the Democratic presidential nomination.)\nSanders is striving to harness the energy to help him in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, where his crowds have been much smaller but still relatively robust. Volunteers hand out donation envelopes to rally attendees and carefully take down their contact information so they can be solicited for money later.\nIn Los Angeles, anyone who gave on the spot received a Sanders campaign T-shirt. Speakers asked the crowd to text \u201cBernie\u201d to a five-digit number. In reply, they would receive text messages seeking money and volunteer time.\nWhen Sanders came onstage, the cheers were deafening. His voice hoarse, the senator told the crowd, \u201cThis campaign is not a billionaire-funded campaign \u2014 it is a people-funded campaign.\u201d\n\"There is no president who will fight harder to end institutional racism,\" he said. \"Or for a higher minimum wage.

Bernie! Bernie!\u201d the crowd shouted in response.\nMike Jelf, 69, said he spent the day before the rally leafleting for the campaign in nearby Torrance. He brought his Saint Bernard, Munro, to the arena, wearing a shirt that said \u201cSaints for Sanders.\u201d\n\u201cI want to see a country that\u2019s returned to the people, rather than a plutocratic oligarchy,\u201d Jelf said. \u201cI would like to have a planet that\u2019s habitable for future generations.\u201d\nJean-Luc St. Pierre, 19, said he flew from Maryland to attend the rally. He started a \u201cBaltimore for Bernie\u201d Facebook group targeting people in the home town of former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley, another Democratic presidential candidate.\nGloria Rios, from Eagle Rock, Calif., said she joined Sanders\u2019s e-mail list a month ago. \u201cI feel very strongly about him,\u201d she said, adding that she...[Content truncated]",

In Minneapolis, a thousand listened from outside after the basketball arena where Sanders was speaking filled to capacity.\nBut Madison was different.\n\u201cTonight we have made history,\u201d Sanders declared to thunderous applause. \u201cTonight we have more people at a meeting for a candidate for president of the United States than any other candidates have.\"\nIndeed, Sanders -- the self-declared Democratic-socialist from Vermont; the former perennial protest candidate; the man who until a few weeks ago belonged to neither party -- turned out more people Wednesday night than has any candidate of either party so far this year.\n**WATCH:\u00a0**\nDemocratic front-runner Hillary Clinton attracted 5,500 people, according to her campaign, to her kickoff rally in New York City, and 1,800 in Virginia last week but has otherwise not focused on large rallies.\u00a0While Republican Sen.

Both had retired from working as schoolteachers in South Carolina public schools\u2014Rollins taught first grade, Hill taught high school civics\u2014and are enjoying the good benefits that can come after a long career in the public sector.\n\u201cThe thing is, we\u2019re doing just fine,\u201d Rollins said in a gravely South Carolina drawl. \u201cBut too many people have this attitude, \u2018I got mine, but to hell with you.\u2019\u201d\nIt\u2019s a common sentiment among older voters who\u2019ve told me they\u2019re supporting Sanders, not because he\u2019ll improve their lives, but because they think he\u00a0has a vision for those who are younger and struggling.\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t an older citizen vote for somebody with that kind of a record?\u201d\nPolling suggests Sanders is underperforming among South Carolina\u2019s older voters. An NBC News/Marist survey released earlier this week showed Joe Biden crushing Sanders across the demographic. While that poll generally captured a neck and neck race between those two candidates, it found 36 percent of \u201cbaby boomers\u201d ages 55 to 73, and 40 percent of those over 73, favoring the former vice president. Sanders, meanwhile, only got 12 and 8 percent of their support, respectively.\nMyrtle Beach could be seen as a unfriendly ground for Sanders to stump in the last days before Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary.
