Bernie Sanders speaks at a campaign rally in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.\nIf you only considered crowd size at rallies for Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, you might wonder how Clinton has won so many big states. Sanders draws massive, enthusiastic crowds, while Clinton's rallies often seem tiny and subdued by comparison.\nMonday night, the eve of five East Coast primaries taking place today, Sanders spoke to an overflow crowd — 3,200 people in total — at Drexel University in Philadelphia. His audience was more than double the crowd that showed up to hear Hillary Clinton speak at Philadelphia's city hall.\nOn Sunday, 14,000 were there for Sanders in New Haven, Conn.\n6,600 in Baltimore, Md., on Saturday.\nAnd 27,000 people came to hear Sanders in Manhattan's Washington Square Park a week before New York's crucial primary.\nBut Sanders went on to lose that state by 16 points. His big crowds haven't translated into the kind of wins needed to lock down the nomination. Why?\nThe Enthusiasm Gap May Be An Optical Illusion\nSince last summer, when Sanders' huge rallies got him noticed by the national media, there's been a lot of discussion of an \"enthusiasm gap\" between Sanders and Clinton.\nBut in a recent Gallup poll, it was Clinton, not Sanders, who...[Content truncated]",

I think that’s not really a controversial claim, but here are some links if you need them.\nThe big question, obviously, is whether success at attracting big crowds actually predicts success in primaries and caucuses. One argument goes something like: “Wow, if people are willing to stand in line out in the cold for hours to see the candidate speak, then surely they are willing to spend the time and effort to show up and vote.”\nThat may seem plausible on its face, but I’m going to inject a note of caution. It goes like this: If you want to see Trump or Sanders speak, you have to go to the rally. But if you want to see Trump or Sanders win, you do not have to vote.\nHere’s what I mean. The benefits you might get from a rally — a chance to express your passion for a candidate, be inspired or entertained by their speech, enjoy the company of other supporters — depend on going to the rally.

When Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders cemented himself as the front-runner for the party nomination with his victory in Saturday’s Nevada caucuses, we decided to give one of his rally speeches the same treatment.\n    \n\n            We chose a 47-minute speech the Vermont senator made at the University of Houston the day after the caucuses. We looked into 27 checkable assertions of fact. \n    \n\n            The result: three claims were false, six claims we couldn’t render a verdict on because an exact figure is not publicly known and 18 claims were true or mostly true. \n    \n\nAt CNN, we start with the facts. Visit CNN’s home for Facts First.\n\n\n            Of the three false claims, one was a data error made by a think tank and not disclosed to the Sanders campaign until after he gave this speech. Another was an exaggeration about health care Sanders has repeated for more than a decade even as fact checkers have repeatedly debunked it. The third, about Trump’s 2017 tax law, was an inaccurate description of a legitimate figure in a study. \n    \n\n            Sanders made far fewer false claims than Trump tends to make at rallies.

York Times\n*   Sept. 15, 2023\nAt a rally in downtown Detroit on Friday, just a couple of hundred yards from the headquarters of General Motors, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont addressed a cheering crowd of United Auto Workers members, capping a day of walkouts by the union with an effort to rally support for the strike.\nMr. Sanders echoed the populist talking points of his campaigns for president in 2016 and 2020, speaking about income inequality in the United States, and he criticized the chief executives of the Big Three automakers — G.M., Stellantis and Ford Motor — for their compensation.\n“The fight you are waging here is not just about decent wages and working conditions and pensions in the auto industry,” Mr. Sanders said. “It’s a fight to take on corporate greed and tell the people on top the country belongs to all of us, not just the few.”\nThe rally took place along Detroit’s riverfront, near the city’s iconic Renaissance Center towers, home to G.M. headquarters. Also nearby is the Huntington Place convention center, where auto executives were gathering for a black-tie charity ball to kick off the 2023 Detroit auto show.\nSeveral hundred U.A.W. members, most of them clad in labor’s red shirts and waving picket signs, crowded in front of the rally’s small stage. A dozen television cameras were jammed together on another small, raised platform to record the event. As the crowd awaited the first speakers, a sound system blared upbeat anthems like Sister Sledge’s “We Are Family“ and “We’re Not Going to Take It” by Twisted Sister.\nThroughout Mr. Sanders’s speech, they erupted into chants of “Bernie, Bernie!”\nMr. Sanders spoke about the growing gap between C.E.O. and worker pay. The U.A.W. has said that one of the driving forces behind its demands for higher pay is the growth in compensation for the top leaders at the Big Three automakers.\nAddressing the Big Three leaders, Mr. Sanders said, “Understand, C.E.O.s, the sacrifices your workers have made over the years.”\nIn a comment directed at Mary T. Barra, G.M.’s chief executive, Mr. Sanders said, “Do you understand what it’s like to live on $17 an hour?” Mr. Sanders went on to make pointed remarks about the growth in compensation for Ms. Barra, as well as Carlos Tavares and Jim Farley, her counterparts at Stellantis and Ford...[Content truncated]",
