Reade\u2019s story took these complaints further \u2014 showing how even lower-grade inappropriate conduct can have real consequences for a woman\u2019s career, an important subject that we still don\u2019t talk about nearly enough.\nI knew I wasn\u2019t the only reporter Reade was talking to. The New York Times had three reporters on the story, she told me. On April 3, the day after we first spoke, she texted me four times. She wanted to know when I planned to publish, and she warned me that other outlets were getting ready to do so.\nThat day,  published an article with her story. This happens sometimes. It\u2019s happened to me, many times. You fight for a story that would be explosive if you could prove it, but you can\u2019t. I continued reporting on her story for a few more weeks after the story broke, but I didn\u2019t get enough. Vox did not publish anything about Reade in 2019. Neither did the major outlets that I know were pursuing the story, including the Times, the Washington Post, and the Associated Press.\nIn March 2020, Reade resurfaced with a new allegation, which she told on . In addition to her account of her experience with office staff, Reade said that in 1993, Biden forced an unwanted sexual encounter on her. She said Biden pushed her against a wall on the Capitol grounds, kissed her, and then digitally penetrated her \u2014 all against her will.\nBiden\u2019s campaign did not respond publicly to Reade\u2019s claims in 2019. On May 1, Biden answered questions about the allegations for the first time on MSNBC\u2019s _Morning Joe_. He denied all of Reade\u2019s claims and underscored his denial of the sexual assault allegation. \u201cI\u2019m saying unequivocally, it never, never happened,\u201d he  host Mika Brzezinski.\nThree aides whom Reade said she approached about her complaints in 1993  the New York Times that they also dispute her account. \u201cI never once witnessed, or heard of, or received, any reports of inappropriate conduct, period \u2014 not from Ms. Reade, not from anyone,\u201d said Marianne Baker, Biden\u2019s longtime executive assistant. \u201cI have absolutely no knowledge or memory of Ms. Reade\u2019s accounting of events, which would have left a searing impression on me as a woman professional, and as a manager.\u201d\nWhen Reade\u2019s story reemerged in a new form, I went through my reporting notes and interview transcripts from a year ago. I spoke with Reade last week for several hours over the course of...[Content truncated]",

The supervisor calls the employee into his office and tells her that he will allow it this time, but if she ever brings up the ADA again, she \"will be sorry.\" The supervisor's threat constitutes interference with the exercise of ADA rights in violation of the statute, even if not accompanied or followed by any adverse action.\nEXAMPLE 27\nManager Conditions Accommodation on Withdrawal of Formal Accommodation Request\nAfter a lengthy interactive process, an employee with multiple sclerosis is granted a change in schedule as an accommodation. When her condition subsequently worsens, she requests additional accommodations, including telecommuting on days when her symptoms flare up and prevent her from walking. The employer has a policy that prohibits telework. When her supervisor consults human resources, he is advised that the ADA may require making an exception to the usual policy as a reasonable accommodation, unless it would pose an undue hardship. Instead of proceeding with the interactive process, the supervisor tells the employee that if she withdraws her request for accommodation, he will informally allow her to work from home one day per week, but that, if she persists with her formal accommodation request, he will tell human resources that her job cannot be performed from home. The supervisor's actions constitute interference in violation of the ADA.\nEXAMPLE 28\nManager Threatens Employee with Adverse Action\nIf She Does Not Forgo Accommodation\nPreviously Granted\nDue to post-traumatic stress disorder following a nighttime attack, an employee is accommodated with shift assignments that assure that she can commute to and from work during daytime hours. She is subsequently assigned a new supervisor who threatens to have her transferred, demoted, or placed on medical retirement if she does not work a \"normal schedule.\" Based on these facts, the supervisor has violated the interference provision of the ADA.\nEXAMPLE 29\nRefusal to Consider Applicant Unless He Submits to Unlawful Pre-Employment Medical Examination\nA job applicant declines an interviewer's request to submit to a pre-offer medical examination, citing the ADA's prohibition against conducting medical examinations prior to making a conditional offer of employment. The interviewer refuses to consider the application without the examination, so the applicant submits to it. Regardless of whether or not the applicant is qualified or is hired, the employer engaged in interference as well as an improper disability-related examination in violation of the ADA.\nIV.

The frequency of false allegations of sexual abuse by children and adolescents is of significant legal and clinical importance. The rate of false allegations of sexual abuse is examined in a large sample of Child Protective Services (CPS) cases. The criteria used by CPS workers in judging the validity of allegations are considered, and the relationship between substantiation rates and attitudes about the trustworthiness of child reports of abuse is explored. Many professionals in the field of child sexual abuse are more skeptical of child and adolescent claims of sexual abuse than available research suggests is warranted. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 1989, 28, 2:230-235. Key Words: sexual abuse, validation, false allegations. Child sexual abuse cases in which there exists definitive, objective evidence of abuse are the exception rather than the rule. Typically, there are no eyewitnesses and physical evi-dence is found in only 15% of confirmed cases (Kerns, 1981). Even if medical evidence is present, it seldom identifies the specific perpetrator. Therefore, unless a confession is ob-tained, determination of whether and by whom the sexual abuse was committed rests, in large measure, on the word of the child. The evaluator may consider a range of other factors such as the behavioral and emotional state of the child and the interaction of the child and suspected perpetrator, but substantiation of the abuse allegation typically depends upon the evaluator's judgment about the validity and truthfulness of the child's statements. For this reason, the frequency with which children and adolescents make false allegations of sexual abuse is of utmost legal and clinical importance. A number of guidelines for assessing the validity of a child's report of abuse have been offered (e.g., Sgroi et al., 1982; Weiss, 1983; Faller, 1984; de Young, 1986; Benedek and Schetky, 1987a,b; Jones and...[Content truncated]",

They may contain errors._\n*   **Judy Woodruff:**\n    More than a year after President Biden won the presidential election, former President Trump and his allies insist, without evidence, that widespread voter fraud led to a stolen election.\n    A new, exhaustive piece of reporting from the Associated Press shows that simply is not true. AP Reporters went looking for cases of voter fraud in six states that Trump has challenged, and they found fewer than 475 potential instances out of more than 25 million votes cast, a number that would not have come close to changing the outcome.\n    I spoke yesterday to Christina Cassidy. She's one of the reporters for the AP.\n    Christina Cassidy, thank you so much for joining us.\n    This was a deep and wide-ranging effort that you and your colleagues made. What, there were you and 10 other reporters. You talked to, what, 340 election officials across these states.\n    What were you trying to find out?\n*   **Christina Cassidy, Associated Press:**\n    Heading into the November 3 election, we were...[Content truncated]",

He also labeled then-President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection \"a total sham.\"\nHe leaned on that same tactic in 2016 during the GOP primaries, including the Iowa and Colorado caucuses, which he lost to Cruz.\n\"Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified,\" Trump tweeted that year without providing evidence. Cruz rebuffed Trump at the time, telling supporters at one event: \"Donald, it ain\u2019t stealing when the voters vote against you -- it is the voters reclaiming this country and reclaiming sanity.\"\nTrump later said the Colorado caucuses were similarly \"rigged\" and dismissed opponent Hillary Clinton's victory over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary.\n\nYet it was during and after the 2016 general election, in which he lost the popular vote to Clinton but won the Electoral College, that he began making claims of fraud more consistently.\nIn the final weeks of the 2016 race, he refused to confirm whether he would accept a defeat.
