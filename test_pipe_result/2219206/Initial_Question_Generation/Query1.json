Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today released the following statement in response to Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s claim yesterday that criticism of the Israeli government’s policies is antisemitic:_\nNo, Mr. Netanyahu. It is not antisemitic or pro-Hamas to point out that in a little over six months your extremist government has killed 34,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 77,000 – seventy percent of whom are women and children.\nIt is not antisemitic to point out that your bombing has completely destroyed more than 221,000 housing units in Gaza, leaving more than one million people homeless – almost half the population.\nIt is not antisemitic to note that your government has obliterated Gaza’s civilian infrastructure – electricity, water, and sewage.\nIt is not antisemitic to realize that your government has annihilated Gaza’s health care system, knocking 26 hospitals out of service and killing more than 400 health care workers.\nIt is not antisemitic to condemn your government’s destruction of all of Gaza’s 12 universities and 56 of its schools, with hundreds more damaged, leaving 625,000 students with no education.\nIt is not antisemitic to agree with virtually every humanitarian organization in saying that your government, in violation of American law, has unreasonably blocked humanitarian aid coming into Gaza, creating the conditions in which hundreds of thousands of children face malnutrition and famine.\nMr. Netanyahu. Antisemitism is a vile and disgusting form of bigotry that has done unspeakable harm to many millions of people. But, please, do not insult the intelligence of the American people by attempting to distract us from the immoral and illegal war policies of your extremist and racist government. Do not use antisemitism to deflect attention from the criminal indictment you are facing in the Israeli courts. It is not antisemitic to hold you accountable for your actions.\n#### Follow me on Twitter\n#### \n#### Search Site\nOffice Locations\n----------------\n### Washington...[Content truncated]",

But that constituted fewer than half (42%) of GOP voters who supported Trump for the nomination.\n**Today, voters who back a Trump presidency are divided on priorities for U.S. immigration policy.** Nearly half (48%) of Trump supporters say the priority for policy to deal with illegal immigration should be stronger law enforcement and better border security. Just 10% say the priority should be creating a way for undocumented immigrants to become citizens if they meet certain requirements. But about four-in-ten (41%) say both of these approaches should be given equal priority.\nWhen Trump voters who give equal priority to both are asked to choose just one, a majority overall comes down on the side of stronger law enforcement and better border security: 78% say this should be the priority, compared with just 19% who prioritize a path to citizenship for those in the U.S. illegally. Among Clinton supporters, opinions are nearly reversed: 80% say a path to citizenship should be the priority, while 19% prioritize tougher law enforcement and better border security.\nTopics\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \nShare This Link:\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n!\n is director of political research at Pew Research Center.\n### Related\nreportJul 11, 2024\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nshort readsJun 21, 2024\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nshort readsJun 14, 2024\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nreportJun 11, 2024\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nreportJun 6, 2024\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------...[Content truncated]",

We’re still looking into some of his claims, but at least 10 were wrong.\n    \n\n            Here is a fact check.\n    \n\nHarris and the retirement age\n\n\n            Discussing Social Security, Trump claimed of President Joe Biden and Harris: “They’re talking about, he was talking, she’s talking about – lifting the retirement age.”\n    \n\nFacts First: This claim is false about Harris. She has not spoken in favor of raising the age for receiving Social Security retirement benefits. (Biden did, as a US senator in the 2000s and prior, express support for or openness to raising the retirement age, but he has been a vocal opponent of the idea as president.)\n    \n\n            Harris has supported increasing, not reducing, Social Security benefits. In 2019, about two years before she became vice president, she co-sponsored a bill from Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, called the Social Security Expansion Act, that would boost Social Security benefits by raising payroll taxes on high earners.\n    \n\nHarris and abortion\n\n\n            Trump said, “She wants abortions in the eighth and ninth month of pregnancy, that’s fine with her, right up until birth, and even after birth – the execution of a baby.” \n\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim that Harris supports the execution of babies after birth is false. She has never said anything to endorse post-birth murder, which is illegal everywhere in the country; Trump has frequently claimed that some Democratic states allow such post-birth executions, but that claim...[Content truncated]",

He also labeled then-President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection \"a total sham.\"\nHe leaned on that same tactic in 2016 during the GOP primaries, including the Iowa and Colorado caucuses, which he lost to Cruz.\n\"Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified,\" Trump tweeted that year without providing evidence. Cruz rebuffed Trump at the time, telling supporters at one event: \"Donald, it ain’t stealing when the voters vote against you -- it is the voters reclaiming this country and reclaiming sanity.\"\nTrump later said the Colorado caucuses were similarly \"rigged\" and dismissed opponent Hillary Clinton's victory over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary.\n\nYet it was during and after the 2016 general election, in which he lost the popular vote to Clinton but won the Electoral College, that he began making claims of fraud more consistently.\nIn the final weeks of the 2016 race, he refused to confirm whether he would accept a defeat. Afterward, he insisted he had only lost the popular vote through wrongdoing.\n\"I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,\" he said -- without any proof.\nUpon taking office, Trump set up a short-lived commission to investigate voter fraud, though evidence was never found.\nTrump also warned of voter fraud ahead of the 2018 midterms, when Democrats ultimately won back control of the House of Representatives.\n\"Law Enforcement has been strongly notified to watch closely for any ILLEGAL VOTING which may take place in Tuesday’s Election (or Early Voting). Anyone caught will be subject to the Maximum Criminal Penalties allowed by law,\" he tweeted shortly before Election...[Content truncated]",
