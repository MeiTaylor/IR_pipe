Those included that **Pete Buttigieg** “is what happens when the therapist botches the conversion”; that **Amy Klobuchar** resembles “her name: pained, chunky, confused origin/purpose”; that **Hillary Clinton** should be “catapulted off the planet”; and that **Elizabeth Warren** is “an adult diaper fetishist,” “looks like shit,” and is a liar for misrepresenting her Native American heritage “to get into Harvard,” all in the semi-ironic tone commonly used in internet humor. (Warren  herself as “American Indian” on her Texas bar registration card.) In another tweet, Mora urged his followers to Trojan horse their way into the Bloomberg campaign. Sanders 2020 communications director **Mike Casca** announced on Monday that Mora had been fired from his role over the tweets and stated that his team is “a multiracial, multigenerational campaign for justice where disgusting behavior and ugly personal attacks by our staff will not be tolerated.” (Mora did not respond to the Beast’s request for comment.)\nMany Sanders supporters objected to this chain of events. Also on Monday night, Bixby tweeted that “Fans of Bernie Sanders are now crafting fake tweets from me in the hopes of drawing the ire of a South Korean boy band that I’ve never heard of? This is super fun.” A  sharing Mora’s Venmo handle was liked thousands of times, and various Sanders-supporting factions spoke out against his firing.\nQuestions around Sanders supporters’ online behavior have quickly become a subplot of the Democratic primary, highlighted by the —which described his supporters as “envied and caricatured by rivals who covet such loyalty, feared by Democrats who have faced harassment from his followers, and alternately cherished and gently scolded by the candidate himself”—and Buttigieg, among others. In the past, Sanders’s supporters have highlighted cringey language used by other campaign operatives, as when **Joe Biden** aide **Lindy Li** was criticized for sharing a tweet calling Sanders a “self-hating Jew” (she later ), and Elizabeth Warren faced backlash after one of her surrogates, **Ashlee Marie Preston,** was  to have tweeted racist and homophobic comments,  demanding “Latino and Asian businesses...speak fukn English” and, “Asian hoes act like they wont get karate chopped in they muthafukn...[Content truncated]",

They know what I know, and that is that she is prepared to take on powerful special interests and stand up to the needs of those working people who desperately need defending today.”\nAt least three groups that publicly oppose Su — the American Trucking Associations, the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors and Associated Builders and Contractors Inc. — reported lobbying on her nomination during the first quarter of this year.\nCommittee ranking Republican Bill Cassidy of Louisiana also entered into the record 50 letters from business groups opposing Su’s nomination.\nThe committee is scheduled to vote Su’s nomination on April 26.\nUnions and civil rights groups have launched counterefforts in support of Su, including a six-figure ad-buy announced by the AFL-CIO on Wednesday and set to air in states where moderate Senate Democrats would be up for reelection next cycle. At least seven organizations that publicly support Su filed first quarter lobbying disclosures on the nomination.\nDemocratic Sens.

I can’t imagine why. His role in a riot that could have gotten some of them killed? His masterful design of their midterm debacle? The possibility he’ll be indicted any day now?\nThey’ve had enough, or so they keep signaling and whispering.\nAnd then they go and choose Sarah Huckabee Sanders to deliver the party’s official response to President Biden’s State of the Union address.\nYeah, yeah: She’s young, she’s a working mom, she’s the first female governor of Arkansas (where she’s not yet through her first month in office).

Trump gathered near Trump Tower the night before the first day of the fraud trial against him and his company.Credit...Dave Sanders for The New York Times\nFormer President Donald J. Trump had a lot to say on  against him and his company. Speaking to reporters at a Manhattan courthouse on Monday, he dismissed the judge as a “rogue” justice and said he did not “think the people of this country are going to stand for it.” And he focused on the official who filed the lawsuit against him, New York’s attorney general, Letitia James.\n“This is a disgrace,” he said, “and you ought to go after this attorney general.”\nThe remark urging people to “go after” a top elected official in New York, by a former president whose invective has become a familiar backdrop of American life, was part of a pattern of increasingly sharp language from Mr. Trump.\nDays earlier, he told hundreds of Republican activists in California that . Not long before that, he insinuated that the military general he personally appointed as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff should be .\nSince he first became a political candidate in the 2016 presidential race, Mr. Trump has glorified violence,...[Content truncated]",

A beer remained lodged in the armrest, unperturbed. Nearby a telephone pole lay flat on its back. It’s not every day a professional wrestler from a Choctaw-Chickasaw bloodline blunders his vehicle into your personal arena, giving up his prime seat to boot.\nCharlotte didn’t qualify as an NFL market, so we outsourced our allegiances rather than suffer through everybody’s dad issuing nostalgic burps on behalf of the Redskins. (Though nobody bothered consulting Wahoo on his feelings about the Redskins slur, Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson does remember being obliterated by the wrestling star, when Wahoo played linebacker for the Dolphins.) The Detroit Lions were my chosen squad, despite them not having acquired a championship since the Eisenhower administration. I’d like to say my decision was informed by the fact that two of the Lions’ star players—Mel Farr and Lem Barney—had gold records from singing backup on Marvin Gaye’s “What’s Going On.” Or that my favorite player, Charlie Sanders, was from North Carolina. Or that they had a guy named Dick “Nighttrain” Lane. But I chose the Lions for no other reason than they weren’t Washington, a team that had been reliably beating them since 1935.\nTo watch the Lions I bought a book about the Lions. _Detroit Lions: The Great Years_ had a black-and-white photograph of tight end Charlie Sanders extending for a catch against the Oakland Raiders. It’s a two-page spread, Sanders on the right, Oakland safety George Atkinson closing in from the left. The crowd is out of focus, disoriented. The darkroom effect of dodging and burning had blurred the nosebleeds into a black void. Atkinson and Sanders seem to be playing by themselves. I feared for Sanders, stuck in this moment of imminent collision. Did he catch that ball?\nGeorge Atkinson was one of the most feared hitters in the league. He and Raider teammate Jack Tatum were, in their words, out to “sever players from reality.” My older brother adopted this mission statement when we’d spend Sunday afternoons beating the church out of each other, acting out goal-line stands on the vinyl couch in the den. It was sibling violence erupting from the Nerf-brained boredom of being stuck watching Washington. Slo-mo was required for exaggerated grimace and historical accuracy. Occasionally, my brother would speed...[Content truncated]",
