AP Reporters went looking for cases of voter fraud in six states that Trump has challenged, and they found fewer than 475 potential instances out of more than 25 million votes cast, a number that would not have come close to changing the outcome.\n    I spoke yesterday to Christina Cassidy. She's one of the reporters for the AP.\n    Christina Cassidy, thank you so much for joining us.\n    This was a deep and wide-ranging effort that you and your colleagues made. What, there were you and 10 other reporters. You talked to...[Content truncated]",

It is the Commission's position, however, that an employer can be liable for retaliation if it takes it upon itself to impose consequences for actions taken in the course of participation.\nAlthough courts often limit the participation clause to administrative charges or lawsuits filed to enforce rights under an EEO statute, and instead characterize EEO complaints made internally (e.g., to a company manager or human resources department) as \"opposition,\" the Supreme Court in Crawford v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville & Davidson County explicitly left open the question of whether internal EEO complaints might be considered \"participation\" as well. The Commission and the Solicitor General have long taken the view that participation and opposition have some overlap, in that raising complaints, serving as a voluntary or involuntary witness, or otherwise participating in an employer's internal complaint or investigation process, whether before or after an EEOC or Fair Employment Practices Agency (FEPA) charge has been filed, is covered under the broad protections of the participation clause, although it is also covered as \"opposition.\" The plain terms of the participation clause prohibit retaliation against those who \"participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\" under the statute. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a) (emphasis added). As courts have observed, these statutory terms are broad, unqualified, and not expressly limited to investigations conducted by the EEOC. Similarly, contacting a federal agency employer's internal EEO Counselor under 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105 to allege discrimination is participation.\nThis application of the participation clause is supported by the Supreme Court's decisions in Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775 (1998) and Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742 (1998), which created an affirmative defense to discriminatory harassment liability based on the availability and proper functioning of internal complaint and investigation processes. The adoption of such policies or the fact that an employee unreasonably failed to utilize them governs liability for various types of harassment claims. An effective process necessitates that employees be willing to participate, whether by providing information that is pro-employer, pro-employee, or neutral. Such participation enables an employer to take prompt corrective action where needed, and may later shield the employer from liability under the EEO laws. It follows that participation in such complaint and investigation processes is participation in an \"investigation\" or \"proceeding\" within the meaning...[Content truncated]",

Recent studies in computational social science suggest users online tend to select information by confirmation bias and to join virtual echo chambers, which reinforce and polarize their beliefs.\nAt the extreme end of the spectrum, conspiracy theorists tend to explain significant social or political aspects as plots conceived by powerful individuals or organizations. These plots share an important characteristic with so-called urban legends: the objects of the narratives inevitably threaten the established social order and focus on what communities and social groups deeply fear. Fake news are also a major problem as regularly raised by several policymakers, among whom for example the President of Italian Chamber of Deputees Laura Boldrini in a recent open consultation with stakeholders from all sectors.\nDiscussion within groups of like-minded people seems to negatively influence users’ emotions and to enforce group...[Content truncated]",

Holmes\nFollow\n--\nListen\nShare\nFrom Umber.LIFE, Jan. 2019: As we recognized the 90th year of Martin Luther King’s life, there is no reason for real activists to support this King anymore.\nJanuary 15th, 2019 marked 90 years since Dr. Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. was born. His entire life and existence quaked the very landscape of activism, not just for the black American identity, but he has become a model for almost every modern movement or moment for advocacy in the last 50 years.\nDr. King’s work for Black America made strides towards equality for African-Americans and all people of color in the United States, and Barack Obama’s election to the presidency led many to claim his infamous “Dream” had been fulfilled. However, Black people in today’s America are still struggling for equity, and our current society is built and thriving from the slavery and racism that this country was founded with. Activism for the Black Identity is far from done, but the movements that have risen since Dr. King’s assassination (among others) have not shared the same linear path.\nThe Black Lives Matter movement is an example of this. While one of the largest modern organizations dedicated to advocating for the black identity, leaders and chapters of the movement may not share the exact same goals — as all movements do. Deray McKesson and Erica Garner were two leaders with differing messages or methods, just like Adam Clayton Powell and Bayard Rustin or Dr. King and Malcolm X of the Civil Rights Era. There’s nothing inherently wrong with disagreement with others in the movement, but real activists know that as long as all are committed to the ultimate goal is being worked toward.\nDr. King recognized this, and even delivered sermons in 1957 on the subject of “personality integration” in activism, as he called it, or “Conquering Self-Centeredness”. In his own words:\n“An individual has not begun to live until he can rise above the narrow horizons of his particular individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity. And this is one of the big problems of life, that so many people never quite get to the point of rising above self. And so they end up the tragic victims of self-centeredness. They end up the victims of distorted and disrupted personality.”\n...[Content truncated]",

Although scarce and methodologically limited, these early studies provided two key insights that laid the foundations for current research on conspiracy theories. The first key insight is that although conspiracy theories differ widely in content, subjective beliefs in them are rooted in the same underlying psychology. This insight is suggested by findings that the single best predictor of belief in one conspiracy theory is belief in a different conspiracy theory (Goertzel, ; see also Lewandowski, Oberauer, & Gignac, ; Swami et al., ; Sutton & Douglas, ). Even beliefs in mutually incompatible conspiracy theories are positively correlated (e.g., Princess Diana was murdered vs. Princess Diana staged her own death; Wood, Douglas, & Sutton, ). While many conceptually distinct conspiracy theories exist, the tendency to believe in them appears to be underpinned by broader beliefs that support conspiracy theories in general (e.g., beliefs in cover ups; Wood et al., ). Some scholars argue for a _conspiracy mindset_ as a relatively stable predisposition to believe in conspiracy theories that varies between persons (Imhoff & Bruder, ). Despite the high variability in conspiracy theories—involving topics that range from climate change to chronic illnesses to terrorist attacks—research demonstrates that largely similar and predictable psychological processes drive people's belief in them.\nThe second key insight is that besides individual differences, belief in conspiracy theories is highly sensitive to social context. For instance, ideological motivations influence political conspiracy beliefs depending on election results (e.g., Democrats believe governmental conspiracy theories particularly if there is a Republican in the White House, and vice versa; Wright & Arbuthnot, ; see also Golec de Zavala & Federico, ; Uscinski & Parent, ; Van Bavel & Pereira, ). Moreover, throughout history people have believed conspiracy theories particularly in impactful societal crisis situations, such as during fires, floods, earthquakes, rapid societal change, violence, and wars (McCauley & Jacques, ; see also Van Prooijen & Douglas, ). Finally, social structures that shape citizens’ feelings of vulnerability increase belief in conspiracy theories, as reflected in findings that feelings of powerlessness predict conspiracy beliefs (Abalakina‐Paap et al., ; Imhoff & Bruder, ), and that conspiracy beliefs are high particularly among members of stigmatized minority groups (Crocker et al., ; Davis, Wetherell, & Henry, ; Van Prooijen, Staman, & Krouwel, ).\nRecent research has drawn heavily on these two...[Content truncated]",

In 2008 and 2012 Barack Obama won with potentially durable majorities, and all Clinton really needed to do was get the same voters to back a Democratic candidate for a third time. However, faced with the prospect of a crass and corrupt Republican nominee, she tried to broaden the Democratic electorate as much as possible instead of trying to consolidate Obama’s base, ignoring states in the “Blue Wall” like Michigan and Wisconsin and diverting resources to areas she didn’t really need to win like Arizona and Georgia. Accordingly, I examine “did Sanders cost her the election” through the prism of whether he cost her votes from the Obama coalition that she was unable to fully replicate.\nNext, let’s turn to the Sanders effect. It makes sense to look at how his behavior affected (if at all) the following groups:\n*   Sanders voters who voted for Trump\n*   Sanders voters who voted for third parties\n*   Sanders voters who did not vote\n*   Non-Sanders voters who did not vote for Clinton\nFortunately, the Cooperative Congressional Election Study has collected data that can help guide us in determining whether they would have voted for Clinton if not for the Sanders campaign.\n### Sanders-Trump voters\nThe phenomenon of Sanders-Trump voters is perhaps the easiest to dismiss out of hand as costing Clinton the election. Much of the phenomenon is attributable to the function of party registration. Registration with a political party is a lagging indicator. For example, West Virginia was Trump’s second-best state in terms of vote percentage and percentage margin (after Wyoming). However, registered Democrats  registered Republicans in the Mountain State. That’s because so many West Virginians registered as Democrats when the state was still solidly blue and never changed their registration to Republican as they started voting differently. Switching party registration involves paperwork and deadlines, so less involved voters don’t necessarily get around to making a change. So in  like Oklahoma, Kentucky, and West Virginia, these ancestral, less-engaged Democrats can’t vote in Republican primaries. In 2008, they voted overwhelmingly for Clinton, who was running to the right of eventual-winner Barack Obama. In 2012, these states gave outsized numbers of votes to barely-funded, fringe Democrats running against Obama. And in 2016, Oklahoma and West Virginia thumbed their nose at Clinton and voted for Sanders while Kentucky backed Clinton but by less than a point.\nThe data bear this out.

This is not an easy distinction but good reporters make it: they learn to understand and communicate the sources and nature of a toxic ideology without justifying it, much less advocating it.\nToday’s newsroom turns that moral logic on its head, at least when it comes to fellow Americans. Unlike the views of Hamas, the views of many Americans have come to seem dangerous to engage in the absence of explicit condemnation. Focusing on potential perpetrators – “platforming” them by explaining rather than judging their views – is believed to empower them to do more harm. After the profile of the Ohio man was published, media Twitter lit up with attacks on the article as “normalising” Nazism and white nationalism, and the _Times_ convulsed internally. The _Times_ wound up publishing a cringing editor’s note that hung the writer out to dry and approvingly quoted some of the criticism, including a tweet from a _Washington Post_ opinion editor asking, “Instead of long, glowing profiles of Nazis/White nationalists, why don’t we profile the victims of their ideologies”? The _Times_ did profile the victims of such ideologies; and the very headline of the piece – “A Voice of Hate in America’s Heartland” – undermined the claim that it was “glowing”. But the _Times_ lacked the confidence to defend its own work. (As it happens, being platformed did not do much to increase the power of that Ohio man. He, his wife and his brother lost their jobs and the newly married couple lost the home intended for their muffin pan.)\nThe editor’s note paraded the principle of publishing such pieces, saying it was important to “shed more light, not less, on the most extreme corners of American life”. But less light is what the readers got. As a reporter in the newsroom, you’d have to have been an idiot after that explosion to attempt such a profile. Empathetic reporting about Trump supporters became even more rare. It became a cliché among influential left-wing columnists and editors that blinkered political reporters interviewed a few Trump supporters in diners and came away suckered into thinking there was something besides racism that could explain anyone’s support for the man.\nI failed to take the hint. As the first anniversary of Trump’s inauguration approached, the editors who compile letters to the _Times_, part of my department, had put out a request to readers who supported the president to say what they thought of him now. The results had some nuance. “Yes, he is embarrassing,” wrote one reader....[Content truncated]",

It is a practice intended to give the statements or organizations credibility by withholding information about the source's financial backers. \n\nThe implication behind the use of the term is that instead of a \"true\" or \"natural\" grassroots effort behind the activity in question, there is a \"fake\" or \"artificial\" appearance of support.\n\nThe term astroturfing is derived from AstroTurf, a brand of synthetic carpeting designed to resemble natural grass, as a play on the word \"grassroots\".[citation needed]\n\nIn political science, it is defined as the process of seeking electoral victory or legislative relief for grievances by helping political actors find and mobilize a sympathetic public, and is designed to create the image of public consensus where there is none.[1][2] Astroturfing is the use of fake grassroots efforts that primarily focus on influencing public opinion and typically are funded by corporations and political entities to form opinions.[3]\n\nOn the internet, astroturfers use software to hide their identity. Sometimes one individual operates through many personas to give the impression of widespread support for their client's agenda.[4][5] Some studies suggest astroturfing can alter public viewpoints and create enough doubt to inhibit action.[6][7] In the first systematic study of astroturfing in the United States, Oxford Professor Philip N. Howard argued that the internet was making it much easier for powerful lobbyists and political movements to activate small groups of aggrieved citizens to have an exaggerated importance in public policy debates.[2] Astroturfed accounts on...[Content truncated]",
