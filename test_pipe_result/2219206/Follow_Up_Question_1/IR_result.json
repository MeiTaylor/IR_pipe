And they are getting even more brazen in tactics, as a sample of new posts shows.\nIn September 2019, just a few months ahead of the Democratic primaries, I noticed some posts on Instagram that appeared to use the strategies and tactics very similar to those of the IRA that I observed in my research on Russian interference in the 2016 elections on social media. A few weeks later, Facebook announced that it had taken down about 75,000 posts across 50 IRA-linked accounts from Facebook (one account) and Instagram (50 accounts).\nMy team at Project DATA (Digital Ad Tracking & Analysis) happened to capture some of these posts on Instagram before Facebook removed them.

This is not an easy distinction but good reporters make it: they learn to understand and communicate the sources and nature of a toxic ideology without justifying it, much less advocating it.\nToday’s newsroom turns that moral logic on its head, at least when it comes to fellow Americans. Unlike the views of Hamas, the views of many Americans have come to seem dangerous to engage in the absence of explicit condemnation. Focusing on potential perpetrators – “platforming” them by explaining rather than judging their views – is believed to empower them to do more harm. After the profile of the Ohio man was published, media Twitter lit up with attacks on the article as “normalising” Nazism and white nationalism, and the _Times_ convulsed internally. The _Times_ wound up publishing a cringing editor’s note that hung the writer out to dry and approvingly quoted some of the criticism, including a tweet from a _Washington Post_ opinion editor asking, “Instead of long, glowing profiles of Nazis/White nationalists, why don’t we profile the victims of their ideologies”? The _Times_ did profile the victims of such ideologies; and the very headline of the piece – “A Voice of Hate in America’s Heartland” – undermined the claim that it was “glowing”. But the _Times_ lacked the confidence to defend its own work. (As it happens, being platformed did not do much to increase the power of that Ohio man. He, his wife and his brother lost their jobs and the newly married couple lost the home intended for their muffin pan.)\nThe editor’s note paraded the principle of publishing such pieces, saying it was important to “shed more light, not less, on the most extreme corners of American life”. But less light is what the readers got. As a reporter in the newsroom, you’d have to have been an idiot after that explosion to attempt such a profile. Empathetic reporting about Trump supporters became even more rare. It became a cliché among influential left-wing columnists and editors that blinkered political reporters interviewed a few Trump supporters in diners and came away suckered into thinking there was something besides racism that could explain anyone’s support for the man.\nI failed to take the hint. As the first anniversary of Trump’s inauguration approached, the editors who compile letters to the _Times_, part of my department, had put out a request to readers who supported the president to say what they thought of him now. The results had some nuance. “Yes, he is embarrassing,” wrote one reader....[Content truncated]",

Sometimes one individual operates through many personas to give the impression of widespread support for their client's agenda.[4][5] Some studies suggest astroturfing can alter public viewpoints and create enough doubt to inhibit action.[6][7] In the first systematic study of astroturfing in the United States, Oxford Professor Philip N.

        "Question": "What specific examples or testimonies exist that challenge the notion of fake supporters in Sanders's rallies?",
        "Answer": "To challenge the notion of fake supporters at Bernie Sanders's rallies, we can examine several specific examples and testimonies:\n\n1. **Electoral Momentum Through Genuine Attendance**: During the 2020 Democratic primary, Bernie Sanders drew significant crowds across Texas, with his campaign claiming attendance figures of over 12,700 individuals at a rally in Austin alone. These large gatherings were indicative of genuine grassroots support, contradicting claims of fake supporters. The widespread enthusiasm shown during his events suggests that a substantial number of attendees were authentic supporters, engaged and invested in his candidacy.\n\n2. **Recognition of Structural Issues by Key Political Figures**: Dean Phillips, a Democratic candidate, highlighted how the Democratic National Committee (DNC) allegedly favored certain candidates over others in the primaries. His remarks indicate an acknowledgment of possible unfair practices within the party, which could affect perceptions of legitimacy in the electoral process. However, these comments do not support the existence of fake supporters at Sanders’s rallies but rather point to external manipulation by party dynamics.\n\n3. **Impact of Fake News**: There is evidence that the media narrative surrounding Bernie Sanders's campaign contributed to a broader environment of misinformation, particularly during the primaries. Articles have noted that a concerted effort to undermine Sanders was perpetrated through misleading narratives rather than directly attributing the presence of unqualified supporters at his events. This context challenges the assertion that his rallies were filled with fake supporters, as misinformation seemed more focused on disrupting his campaign image rather than presenting actual evidence of fake attendees.\n\nCollectively, these examples exhibit a significant level of genuine support for Sanders and suggest that allegations regarding fake supporters lack substantive evidence. The existing testimonies and instances of genuine crowd sizes at his rallies provide a strong counter to the notion of organized fake support.",
