It’s literally a life-threatening situation, because you don’t know if your opponent is going to stop attacking you after you go unconscious.\nThe good news is that things aren’t completely hopeless if your opponent gets you in mount and starts hitting you.\n**There are actually ways to survive, escape, and reverse the situation.**\nThe rest of this article is about surviving this exact scenario.\nFirst we’ll first break down exactly what makes the mount so dangerous.  After all, you have to understand a danger before you can deal with it effectively.\nThen we’ll move on to the best defences and escapes that’ll give you a fighting chance of surviving this terrible position. From the bottom of mount you may be down, but you’re definitely not out.\n1, Why Exactly Is the Mount So Dangerous?\n-----------------------------------------\nLet’s go over what makes the mount so...[Content truncated]",

We were across the street in the sidewalk. When I tried to pull him back and tell him no we will go later, he pulled backwards and slipped his harness off. This normally would be okay as he doesn’t go anywhere, but he thought that meant he was free to go to the field to play and ran into traffic. Luckily, it was a relatively quiet side street so there was only one car who was going slower, but I have never been more scared in my life that he may get hit. I eventually got him back in his harness after we both calmed down.\nI’m unsure of what to do now as I don’t know how to un-train this behaviour, but it needs to be done for his safety. Does anyone have any recommendations to prevent the pulling back? For reference, this is my very first dog so his training has all been a learning process for us both. Any advise would help!!\nRead more\nArchived post.

I actually took some lessons from  who showed me how to work on finding the motion on the instrument and now it’s more reliable than what I did before, which was an ok wrist deviation motion. I don’t know if that counts as putting a lot of time in or just learning how to figure it out by working on it in a deliberate fashion (which, isn’t that what all these tutorials are for, anyway?). Either way, I’ll still try the blade of death exercise and do a proper technique critique.\nHi  Through the novelty of experimenting with the trailing edge RDT form, and some persistent relaxation training I’ve managed to finally get the index finger grip version working quite smoothly at a reasonable speed without tension, but I’m having trouble achieving mixed escape. I have the correct form and pickslant, but the USX changes always seem to swipe, with basically a 0% success rate despite trying many different licks. There doesn’t seem to be enough randomness in the motion to get it working.\nWhat general method would you recommend for achieving mixed escape capability with RDT when the smooth, fast and sloppy route doesn’t work? For clarity, when I say mixed escape I mean specifically a primary DSX system, with USX capability through altering the wrist motion trajectory from the same unified form.\nI’ve thought of two preemptive methods that might have merit which I think might help to get mixed escape working eventually and I’d be interested to hear if you think they’re worth trying:\nI’ve had marginal success with trying the classic “two way pickslantling” method you used to use; that is, flip flopping between degrees of supination to access two slightly different RDT forms to achieve both escapes. For clarity this is NOT a forearm helper motion that I’m talking about, it’s intentionally switching your form by a few degrees as required for the line to allow upstrokes to escape, then returning to baseline neutral pickslant DSX form. I can kind of get this working a little bit at speeds like 140-150bpm, but when I go into shreddy tempos it falls apart and becomes a swipey mess since I can’t consciously control the slants at those speeds, but maybe if I push the tempo and embrace the randomness I can get it working. I was thinking maybe getting this method down first would be a useful segue into later learning the more static mixed escape form without needing the constant flip-flopping form changes since it will at least familiarise my brain with...[Content truncated]",

Why? Some people apparently thought it was real-life footage of Secret Service agents training for \"advanced reverse escapes\" in the President's heavily armored car, a ridiculously heavy tank-on-wheels nicknamed \"The Beast.\"\n_Forza 6_ is an incredible game and a graphics powerhouse, but this doesn't look even remotely real. Seriously, watch it! But, you know, it's the internet.\nThe video originates from _Forza_ YouTube celeb Don Joewon Song, who had the Cadillac limo done up in digital Presidential livery. So how did it make the leap from sweet stunt video to absurdity? _Snopes_ points to the  as one of the biggest offenders, having freebooted the YouTube footage with the caption \"Secret Service agents train for advanced reverse escapes.\" As of this writing, that video has 35 million views. That's not to say every viewer was fooled — if you read through the comments, most aren't — but it's still a little ridiculous.\nAll that said, there are a couple things I know to be true: one, racing simulators on modern console and PC hardware are getting really realistic, and I'd bet we're only a few generations away from legitimate photorealism that is indistinguishable from real life to the naked eye. (Even then, though, there's the matter of gamers controlling the cars in a realistic way, which is pretty difficult to do.) And secondly, I _really_ want to see a 10-ton armored limo drift in reverse now. For real.\nPresident Obama, sir, you've got a few months left in office. Let's do this.\n0 Comments / 0 New\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\n1.  \n    * * *\n2.  \n    * * *\n3.  \n    * * *\n4.  \n    * * *\n5.  \n    * * *\nVerge Deals\n-----------\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.\nEmail (required)Sign up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our  and .

Their father is Rorion Gracie, one of the world’s foremost experts in self-defense. In 1993, Rorion created the Ultimate Fighting Championship to showcase the supremacy of the family’s self-defense system in a realistic “no holds barred” confrontation against all comers. Rorion’s younger brother, Royce, won 3 of the first 4 UFC tournaments proving that the leverage-based techniques of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu provided the most reliable way to defeat a larger, more athletic opponent. Ryron and Rener were born into this family tradition of testing the art against all challengers.\nRorion introduced his sons to the art as soon as they could walk. As children, they watched him teach private classes in their garage in Southern California. But, it wasn’t until they observed their father and uncles – Royce, Rickson, and Royler – easily winning challenge matches that they began to comprehend fully the effectiveness of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu. Even more important, Ryron and Rener recognized the profound impact the family’s art had on all who studied it. The life changing transformations of Gracie University students motivated the brothers to teach the art. While constantly perfecting their physical techniques, they worked equally hard to master the powerfully effective instruction methods developed by their forbearers. In 2003, Grand Master Helio Gracie awarded Ryron and Rener black belts in recognition of their mastery of his unique techniques and teaching methodologies.\n* * *\n### Other Lessons in This Course\n###### Free (Registration Required)\n!\n### \nIn this intro class to Blue Belt Stripe 2, Ryron and Rener discuss Training Equipment, Recycling, Principle Ownership, and the Helio Gracie Mindset.

However, later on when the USX motion is demonstrated, the forearm is then supinated, in order to achieve the USX motion. When I try with the slightly more pronated forearm, it feels smooth and comfortable, however, when I try a USX motion with the more supinated forearm, I feel like I’m getting a garage spikes problem where the upstroke is sticking.\nI am confused because it was said that you need to pronate your arm to avoid this garage spikes problem, however you need to reverse this to play USX, seemingly reintroducing the garage spikes problem? I feel like I’m missing something…  \nCould it be that i’m supinating my arm too much, thus introducing some catching of the pick on the string?\nAny help is greatly appreciated!  \nThank you !\n*   #### created\n    May '23\n*   \n*   2.9k\n    #### views\n*   10\n    #### users\n*   44\n    #### likes\n*   11\n    #### links\n### Frequent Posters\n!\n!\n!\n!\n### Popular Links\nThere are **50** replies with an estimated read time of **16 minutes**...[Content truncated]",

I roll with Matt regularly and believe me, Matt is a BEAST on the mats. We’re also lucky enough to have him as one of our instructors at our Burnaby location.\nMatt is showing us a Reverse Dela Riva . The position starts off with Matt in Reverse Dela Spider Guard- yes, that’s actually what it’s called- and then he transitions underneath.\nThe spiralling transition in Reverse DLR is a  most commonly referred to as “Kiss of the Dragon” although that generally connotes a spin through to the back.\nMatt, however; pauses mid spin to apply a brutal Guard configuration that he calls “Reverse X-Guard”.\nAnd he swept me like a hardwood floor with this. I couldn’t believe how strong this position was.\nMatt finishes the sweep with a super technical . BJJ Black Belt, Rob Biernacki, from Island Top Team really helped us out with the details on this Leg Drag. Thanks Professor Rob!\nAnyways, enough of me talking and more of you watching.\nCheck out the vid and let me know what you think in the comments below.\nPeace!\n!\n### \nRitchie Yip is the Head Instructor for InFighting Training Centers located in Downtown Vancouver and Brentwood Burnaby.
