I was standing next to a Chevrolet Malibu's trunk, open and awaiting my imminent installation within, as part of the Escape and Evasion Driving Experience created and taught by former CIA agent Jason Hanson. I'd been so enthralled by the invitation to participate and its promises of ramming through roadblocks and doing high-speed reverse 180 turns that I somehow missed the paragraph about getting bound and thrown into the back of a car.\nNo doubt the opportunity to master such escape techniques appeals to many, but as a short, fat, out-of-shape journalist whose idea of exercise is lifting a Philly cheesesteak to my mouth, I'm not one of them. I don't own a firearm or even a decent set of running shoes. (If you see me running, something behind me is on fire.) I am the polar opposite of a survivalist: In the event of a nuclear war, my goal is to die in the initial attack. Barring that, I'll be the guy on the roof with a sign that says, \"Unarmed; house full of money, food, and tools.\"\nSo it is rather unfortunate that I waited until after my plane tickets were booked to read the message in detail and realize_exactly_what I was in for, which is to learn how to avoid being captured by bad guys—and how to escape if it happens anyway.\nJason Hanson: The (Former) Spy Next Door\n--------------------------------...[Content truncated]",

This normally would be okay as he doesn’t go anywhere, but he thought that meant he was free to go to the field to play and ran into traffic. Luckily, it was a relatively quiet side street so there was only one car who was going slower, but I have never been more scared in my life that he may get hit. I eventually got him back in his harness after we both calmed down.\nI’m unsure of what to do now as I don’t know how to un-train this behaviour, but it needs to be done for his safety.

Why? Some people apparently thought it was real-life footage of Secret Service agents training for \"advanced reverse escapes\" in the President's heavily armored car, a ridiculously heavy tank-on-wheels nicknamed \"The Beast.\"\n_Forza 6_ is an incredible game and a graphics powerhouse, but this doesn't look even remotely real. Seriously, watch it! But, you know, it's the internet.\nThe video originates from _Forza_ YouTube celeb Don Joewon Song, who had the Cadillac limo done up in digital Presidential livery. So how did it make the leap from sweet stunt video to absurdity? _Snopes_ points to the  as one of the biggest offenders, having freebooted the YouTube footage with the caption \"Secret Service agents train for advanced reverse escapes.\" As of this writing, that video has 35 million views. That's not to say every viewer was fooled — if you read through the comments, most aren't — but it's still a little ridiculous.\nAll that said, there are a couple things I know to be true: one, racing simulators on modern console and PC hardware are getting really realistic, and I'd bet we're only a few generations away from legitimate photorealism that is indistinguishable from real life to the naked eye. (Even then, though, there's the matter of gamers controlling the cars in a realistic way, which is pretty difficult to do.) And secondly, I _really_ want to see a 10-ton armored limo drift in reverse now. For real.\nPresident Obama, sir, you've got a few months left in office. Let's do this.\n0 Comments / 0 New\nMost Popular\nMost Popular\n1.  \n    * * *\n2.  \n    * * *\n3.  \n    * * *\n4.  \n    * * *\n5.  \n    * * *\nVerge Deals\n-----------\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.\nEmail (required)Sign up\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our  and .

I was standing next to a Chevrolet Malibu's trunk, open and awaiting my imminent installation within, as part of the Escape and Evasion Driving Experience created and taught by former CIA agent Jason Hanson. I'd been so enthralled by the invitation to participate and its promises of ramming through roadblocks and doing high-speed reverse 180 turns that I somehow missed the paragraph about getting bound and thrown into the back of a car.\nNo doubt the opportunity to master such escape techniques appeals to many, but as a short, fat, out-of-shape journalist whose idea of exercise is lifting a Philly cheesesteak to my mouth, I'm not one of them. I don't own a firearm or even a decent set of running shoes. (If you see me running, something behind me is on fire.) I am the polar opposite of a survivalist: In the event of a nuclear war, my goal is to die in the initial attack. Barring that, I'll be the guy on the roof with a sign that says, \"Unarmed; house full of money, food, and tools.\"\nSo it is rather unfortunate that I waited until after my plane tickets were booked to read the message in detail and realize_exactly_what I was in for, which is to learn how to avoid being captured by bad guys—and how to escape if it happens anyway.\nJason Hanson: The (Former) Spy Next Door\n--------------------------------...[Content truncated]"

    "QA": {
        "Question": "Does the video show Secret Service agents practicing reverse escapes or focus only on driving and drifting?",
        "Answer": "The video does not show Secret Service agents practicing reverse escapes; instead, it focuses exclusively on driving and drifting. The content is derived from a digital racing game, Forza Motorsport 6, and features a car, styled to resemble the President's limousine \"The Beast,\" performing various driving stunts, including drifting. The misconception that the video depicts Secret Service training likely arose from a misleading caption that circulated alongside a popular upload of the video. The original content, created by YouTube personality Don Joewon Song, was intended purely as entertainment and not as a representation of real-life training exercises for secret agents. Given that the video originates from a game context, and no evidence substantiates it as an actual training exercise, I am confident in asserting that the video shows only high-speed driving and drifting rather than any form of organized training by Secret Service agents.",
