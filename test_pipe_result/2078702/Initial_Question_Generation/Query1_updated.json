Seriously, watch it! But, you know, it's the internet.\nThe video originates from _Forza_ YouTube celeb Don Joewon Song, who had the Cadillac limo done up in digital Presidential livery. So how did it make the leap from sweet stunt video to absurdity? _Snopes_ points to the  as one of the biggest offenders, having freebooted the YouTube footage with the caption \"Secret Service agents train for advanced reverse escapes.\" As of this writing, that video has 35 million views. That's not to say every viewer was fooled \u2014 if you read through the comments, most aren't \u2014 but it's still a little ridiculous.\nAll that said, there are a couple things I know to be true: one, racing simulators on modern console and PC hardware are getting really realistic, and I'd bet we're only a few generations away from legitimate photorealism that is indistinguishable from real life to the naked eye. (Even then, though, there's the matter of gamers controlling the cars in a realistic way, which is pretty difficult to do.) And secondly, I _really_ want to see a 10-ton armored limo drift in reverse now. For real.\nPresident Obama, sir, you've got a few months left in office.

I was standing next to a Chevrolet Malibu's trunk, open and awaiting my imminent installation within, as part of the Escape and Evasion Driving Experience created and taught by former CIA agent Jason Hanson. I'd been so enthralled by the invitation to participate and its promises of ramming through roadblocks and doing high-speed reverse 180 turns that I somehow missed the paragraph about getting bound and thrown into the back of a car.\nNo doubt the opportunity to master such escape techniques appeals to many, but as a short, fat, out-of-shape journalist whose idea of exercise is lifting a Philly cheesesteak to my mouth, I'm not one of them. I don't own a firearm or even a decent set of running shoes. (If you see me running, something behind me is on fire.) I am the polar opposite of a survivalist: In the event of a nuclear war, my goal is to die in the initial attack. Barring that, I'll be the guy on the roof with a sign that says, \"Unarmed; house full of money, food, and tools.\"\nSo it is rather unfortunate that I waited until after my plane tickets were booked to read the message in detail and realize_exactly_what I was in for, which is to learn how to avoid being captured by bad guys\u2014and how to escape if it happens anyway.\nJason Hanson: The (Former) Spy Next Door\n--------------------------------...[Content truncated]",

Their concerns are widely shared and legitimate. But professional political scientists can give little guidance as to whether there are such things as \u2018everyday acts of authoritarianism\u2019 or \u2018autocratic leadership\u2019 in a democratic society, and if so what they would look like. They have developed sophisticated analyses of the quality of democracy, and some warning signals of \u2018democratic backsliding\u2019 into authoritarian rule.5 But they\u2014we\u2014lack the vocabulary and the tools to provide a clear, research-based analysis of these apparent phenomena of authoritarianism and illiberalism within established democracies. They have much to say on why leaders like Duterte, Modi, Orb\u00e1n or Trump get elected, but very little on how to evaluate what they do once in office. Nor can they respond to public accusations that the IMF or the WTO are unaccountable and need to be democratized,6 or that digital surveillance such as that practised by the US National Security Agency (NSA) and revealed by the Snowden leaks is authoritarian in an Orwellian sense. Yet without such analysis, without really understanding what authoritarianism or indeed illiberalism might look like in a democratic or transnational context, we are in the dark as to what the exact problem is, what the current trends are, and how those trends might relate to other recent tendencies such as populism, xenophobia and nativism.\nWhy have political scientists developed such blinkers, and how can we set about taking them off? In the academic literature, \u2018authoritarian\u2019 means two quite different things. In comparative politics, it refers to a regime that does not organize periodic free and fair elections. Such regime type classifications tell us that leaders such as Duterte, Modi, Orb\u00e1n and Trump were all (relatively) freely and fairly elected, so that unless they dissolve parliament or steal elections, their respective regimes do not merit formal classification as authoritarian. In political psychology, authoritarianism is about the psychological profile of people characterized by a desire for order and hierarchy and a fear of outsiders. Author...[Content truncated]",
