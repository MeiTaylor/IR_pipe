The sculpture and Grainger Plaza are located on top of Park Grill, between the Chase Promenade and McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink. Constructed between 2004 and 2006, the sculpture is nicknamed \"The Bean\" because of its shape, a name Kapoor later grew fond of. Kapoor himself even uses this title when referring to his work.[1] Made up of 168 stainless steel plates welded together, its highly polished exterior has no visible seams. It measures 33 by 66 by 42 feet (10 by 20 by 13\u00a0m), and weighs 110 short tons (100\u00a0t; 98 long tons).\n\nKapoor's design was inspired by liquid mercury and the sculpture's surface reflects and distorts the city's skyline. Visitors are able to walk around and under Cloud Gate's 12-foot (3.7\u00a0m) high arch. On the underside is the \"omphalos\" (Greek for \"navel\"), a concave chamber that warps and multiplies reflections. The sculpture builds upon many of Kapoor's artistic themes, and it is popular with tourists as a photo-taking opportunity for its unique reflective properties.\n\nThe sculpture was the result of a design competition....[Content truncated]",

Celebrated architects like Frank Lloyd Wright and Louis Sullivan flocked here to build the city that we know today. Alongside architecture, public art has been a fixture of Chicago aesthetics for decades. The city\u2019s public art includes some exemplary pieces of modernist art. Here are the stories behind four sculptures that define public art in downtown Chicago.\nTHE PICASSO\n-----------\nDesigned by Pablo Picasso in 1967, this piece is technically unnamed, but is colloquially referred to as \u201cthe Picasso.\u201d It was one of the first public sculptures to be placed downtown and sits in Daley Plaza inside the Loop. Commissioned by the architects of the Richard J. Daley Center, Picasso refused the payment for the piece, instead creating the sculpture as a gift to the city of Chicago. The Picasso looks a bit like a jungle gym and it is not uncommon to see visitors of the plaza climbing on and around the sculpture.\nALEXANDER CALDER\u2019S FLAMINGO\n---------------------------\nHead a few blocks south in the Loop and you will find yourself dwarfed by the _Flamingo_, a large vermillion abstract sculpture sitting in the Federal Plaza. Alexander Calder designed this sculpture in 1974, clocking in at an epic weight of 50 tons. Calder wanted his sculpture to wind and arch, a curving pop of color surrounded by monumental steel buildings. _Flamingo_ was the first sculpture to be unveiled under the Percent for Art program\u2014a program which administers a percentage of the city budget to public art.\n!\nLeft: Pablo Picasso, Untitled, 1967. Right: Alexander Calder, _Flamingo_, 1974.\nJOAN MIRO\u2019S CHICAGO\n----------------------\nDown the street from Picasso\u2019s sculpture is a work by contemporary master Joan Mir\u00f3, fittingly titled _Chicago_. This piece was unveiled in Brunswick Plaza by Chicago\u2019s first female mayor Jane Byrne in 1981. Mir\u00f3\u2019s sculpture is a 40-foot statue of a woman tucked between two skyscrapers. It is a mixed media sculpture\u2014steel,...[Content truncated]",
