You need an all-access pass to attend the co-located events, giving you the ability to float between these mini-conferences.

So I wanted to officially let you all know my plan for this winter, which is to join those who have tried before and attempt\u00a0to\u00a0climb all the 14ers in one calendar winter. I've gotten off to a slow start.\"\n\"Before this year I hadn't actually climbed any peaks in winter\u2026\"\nWith that extremely low-key announcement on the\u00a014ers.com\u00a0forum, Andrew Hamilton set off to climb all 58 of Colorado\u2019s summits over\u00a014,000\u2019 between the start and end of winter on Dec 21\u00a0and March 20. \u00a0Normally, if a\u00a0person\u00a0had\u00a0never done any\u00a0in\u00a0winter they would be subject to ridicule and scorn, but this is the King of the 14ers we're talking about\u00a0\u2026\n\"I started with Chicago basin, hiking all the way in from purgatory in one 36 hour push. Half way through\u00a0I injured a foot\u00a0tendon and for nearly 20 miles and through a wickedly cold night I hobbled back out.\"\n\"So I've kind of squandered a ridiculously dry start to the winter season. I have about half of the remaining winter to work with because of\u00a0my schedule with my kids...I'm not sure if I'll be able to pull this off \u2026\"\nWell, he did pull it off \u2026\u00a0in his typical style: not particularly fast, but with an insane capacity for sleep deprivation, toughness, and determination.\n\n\u00a0\n\"My mantra for this and all my adventures seems to be \"Be not afraid of moving slowly, be only afraid of standing still\". That can also apply to life I think.\"\nFor the Sawatch summits, instead of going up and then back down to the trailheads and...[Content truncated]",
