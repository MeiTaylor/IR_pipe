The only interaction is visual. It’s standoffish. It feels like a missed opportunity.\nChicago\n-------\nContrast this with Chicago’s . Public art and architecture that is entirely interactive.\nA fountain that spits on you:\n!\nOr a snaking bridge that you can walk or hang out on:\n!\nOr reflect in public:\n!\nChicago understands public art in a public space. The public will only be interested if they can engage with it. Walk on it, play it in, look into it, touch it, brush up against it.

In my home town in Iceland a sculptor’s work was featured quite prominently around the local parks. The sculptor always made sure that apart from being pleasing to the eye, they should be safe – and fun – for kids to climb on. That was the work I grew up with and subconsciously I think that kind of interaction is still what I look for in public art.\n### \non 23 Jun 08\nI’ve made a similar comment about Millennium Park during my numerous visits—that it’s wonderful and alive because people from all walks of life interact with both the art and each other. I was happily surprised when, after people began playing in Crown Fountain in ways that were maybe not expected or intended, that they didn’t put up signs warning of the dangers of playing in it and the city’s lack of liability in case of injury.\nAnd the Bean is one of the most amazing works of public art anyplace— it demands constant interaction because every step turns it into a new work. At the same time, by reflecting the skyline it became part of city instantly. The specialness of the sculpture and how we’ve enjoyed it is the reason that I proposed to my fiancee beside it…\n### \non 23 Jun 08\n> Chicago understands public art in a public space.\nWell, if you don’t count the bit where ...\n###...[Content truncated]",

For the next few days, we'll be discussing the value of art in public life, the impact of public art on our neighborhoods, and how to ensure that public art is created by and for the people, not through a top-down process.\n\nThe author playing on a sculpture in St. Louis, Missouri.\nFor me, the best public art is art that lets people climb and sit on it. Physically engaging with our environment and art can help us to fall in love with the places we live in, and it can make our places feel like they love the human bodies that fill them. Clambering around on a sculpture, helping your friends up, and smiling at strangers at the goofiness is a way to make your body, and the public space it is in, feel fully alive. It opens up the joy of physical movement and it invites us to experience art by touching it and not just looking.\nTo be clear, I do not think all public art should be climbable. Art is vital for memorialization, reflection, and decoration. In many instances, climbing on art is disrespectful and destructive, and it violates the integrity of the art. However, we should occasionally make room for the kind of art that invites us to play with our surroundings.\nThe need for well-designed playgrounds for children that encourage appropriate risk-taking, physical activity, whimsy, and social interaction is well recognized. We should not forget that adults also have the very human need for these experiences. Climbable art can be a playground for adults and just like a playground, it can be designed to engage people with different levels of ability and risk tolerance.\nAs humans...[Content truncated]",

Celebrated architects like Frank Lloyd Wright and Louis Sullivan flocked here to build the city that we know today. Alongside architecture, public art has been a fixture of Chicago aesthetics for decades. The city’s public art includes some exemplary pieces of modernist art. Here are the stories behind four sculptures that define public art in downtown Chicago.\nTHE PICASSO\n-----------\nDesigned by Pablo Picasso in 1967, this piece is technically unnamed, but is colloquially referred to as “the Picasso.” It was one of the first public sculptures to be placed downtown and sits in Daley Plaza inside the Loop. Commissioned by the architects of the Richard J. Daley Center, Picasso refused the payment for the piece, instead creating the sculpture as a gift to the city of Chicago. The Picasso looks a bit like a jungle gym and it is not uncommon to see visitors of the plaza climbing on and around the sculpture.\nALEXANDER CALDER’S FLAMINGO\n---------------------------\nHead a few blocks south in the Loop and you will find yourself dwarfed by the _Flamingo_, a large vermillion abstract sculpture sitting in the Federal Plaza. Alexander Calder designed this sculpture in 1974, clocking in at an epic weight of 50 tons. Calder wanted his sculpture to wind and arch, a curving pop of color surrounded by monumental steel buildings. _Flamingo_ was the first sculpture to be unveiled under the Percent for Art program—a program which administers a percentage of the city budget to public art.\n!\nLeft: Pablo Picasso, Untitled, 1967. Right: Alexander Calder, _Flamingo_, 1974.\nJOAN MIRO’S CHICAGO\n----------------------\nDown the street from Picasso’s sculpture is a work by contemporary master Joan Miró, fittingly titled _Chicago_. This piece was unveiled in Brunswick Plaza by Chicago’s first female mayor Jane Byrne in 1981. Miró’s sculpture is a 40-foot statue of a woman tucked between two skyscrapers. It is a mixed media sculpture—steel,...[Content truncated]",

The sculpture and Grainger Plaza are located on top of Park Grill, between the Chase Promenade and McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink. Constructed between 2004 and 2006, the sculpture is nicknamed \"The Bean\" because of its shape, a name Kapoor later grew fond of. Kapoor himself even uses this title when referring to his work.[1] Made up of 168 stainless steel plates welded together, its highly polished exterior has no visible seams. It measures 33 by 66 by 42 feet (10 by 20 by 13 m), and weighs 110 short tons (100 t; 98 long tons).\n\nKapoor's design was inspired by liquid mercury and the sculpture's surface reflects and distorts the city's skyline. Visitors are able to walk around and under Cloud Gate's 12-foot (3.7 m) high arch. On the underside is the \"omphalos\" (Greek for \"navel\"), a concave chamber that warps and multiplies reflections. The sculpture builds upon many of Kapoor's artistic themes, and it is popular with tourists as a photo-taking opportunity for its unique reflective properties.\n\nThe sculpture was the result of a design competition....[Content truncated]",

With a plethora of world-renowned museums showing , , and the cosmopolitanism of our motley metropolis, the result is **an array of artistic creations** in every shape and form.\nOne area where Chicago particularly excels is in its public art pieces. Many of these were initially met with controversy or scrutiny but have gone on to become **part of the fabric of Chicago** and some of the city’s most cherished features.\nWe haven’t included street art murals here as we have written up a whole other piece on the , so instead we’ve rounded up the very best of Chicago’s **sculptures, mosaics, innovative installations**, and public art pieces of all kinds.\n1\\. _Cloud Gate_ (aka The Bean) by Anish Kapoor\n-----------------------------------------------\nWe have to, of course, begin with the Bean. The huge shiny bean-like sculpture by the Indian-born British artist Anish Kapoor is the result of **168 separate stainless steel plates welded together** to imitate a drop of liquid mercury.\nAfter opening in 2004 it is now **one of the most photographed spots in Chicago** and has become synonymous with our great city. First-named Cloud Gate by Kapoor, the landmark has come to be so unanimously named ‘The Bean’ that even Kapoor himself has .\nIn every season the light bouncing off the curved mirror surfaces and the reflections of the surrounding cityscape provides **an utterly unique experience**. It is truly **one of the most amazing pieces of public art in the city**, if not the whole nation.\n**Artist: Anish Kapoor**\n**Location: Millennium Park, Chicago**\n2\\. _Crown Fountain_ by Jaume Plensa\n------------------------------------\nLocals and tourists alike have enjoyed Jaume Plensa’s stunning interactive public art feature for nearly 20 years now. Two **50 ft towers of LED screens** are separated by a black granite pool each of which projects the faces of **1,000 Chicagoans** and spouts water onto frolicking children below.\nAn urban escape in the hotter months, Crown Fountain has become a beloved and **iconic public feature** of our great city.\n**Artist: Jaume Plensa**\n**Location: Millennium Park, Chicago**\n3\\. _The Picasso_ (the untitled...[Content truncated]",

(For more of my photos, please visit my .)\n!\nBordeaux is a very beautiful city with an abundance of impressive architecture and art work. Although the streets are generally narrow and there is not a lot of green between the buildings, the many charming plazas and street cafes enrich the city in their own way.\n!\nHouses in Bordeaux do not often have flower displays but occasionally one can find some creative plant displays, such as these 'Heavenly Blue' Morning Glories greening up a balcony (seen from below).\n!\nHowever, artistically designed railings, often containing botanical patterns, are very abundant and one of the many gems of the city.\n!\nI found two parks in Bordeaux that I needed to investigate - the older 'Jardin Publique' (Public Garden) and the more recently created 'Jardin Botanique' (Botanical Garden).\nThe 'Jardin Publique' of Bordeaux was inspired by humanistic ideals and was supposed to serve the public of Bordeaux as \"a place of recreation and to stay healthy\".

You see parts of the rope that are normally hidden.”\nWhether she’s choosing colors for a pattern or finding her next hold, making art and climbing require a similar dedication, Amy said—a concentration that connects an artist or a climber to the land that provides their inspiration.\nWhat’s next for Amy Wicks? Well, she’d like to do a three-dimensional piece, with wood and welding. You may have placed an order with her at the Mountain Rambler, but this summer she’ll be working with Inyo National Forest, doing wilderness patrol and working on trails. No doubt that trail time will inspire some new designs, Amy said. “It’ll be good to be outside again.”\nYou won’t find Amy working in a studio—she makes everything on the floor of her living room, which is heaped with rope. In other words, by making a purchase, you contribute to the accessibility of Amy’s furniture. She explained, “the more art I make, the less rope my boyfriend has to deal with!”\nShe welcomes questions at (javascript:;).\n“I don’t have a website because the community interaction is what’s most important to me,” Amy said. She’d also be happy take your worn-out rope off your hands. Once you’re done with a rope, you can pass it along to Amy, instead of resigning it to the landfill.\nYou can find her work all along Main Street in Bishop: at Nuts & Twigs, the Mountain Rambler Brewery, Looney Bean, Black Sheep Coffee Roasters, Sierra Shanti (for yoga mat holders), and sometimes at the Inyo Council for The Arts.\nBetter yet, meet Amy and take a look at her wares (this Saturday, April 20, from 10am-3pm) in the park, during the Earth Day festivities. Come say hi at her table near the creek, close to Main Street.\nTagged:\n-------\n,   \nAbout the Author: Kendra Atleework\n----------------------------------\n!\nKendra Atleework is the author of , a book about the Eastern Sierra, which won the Sigurd F.

A person could be seriously injured or killed, and the city, I'm sure does not want to incur liability. Moreover, the \"bean\" is a work of art, and it is not meant to be climbed.  I certainly understand your desire to take some photos from on top of the bean, but the risks are too great to make it legal to climb. I'm sorry that I couldn't give you a more positive answer to your questions, however, the law is clear. I hope you find this information useful and that you PRESS THE GREEN ACCEPT BUTTON so that I can get credit for answering the question. Thank you.\nCustomer\nHow Can I legally climb the bean/cloud gate?\n]\nI don't believe that there is a way that you can legally climb the bean. However, if you have a \"good\" reason, a safety plan, and a way to use materials that won't scratch or otherwise injure the structure, you COULD go to the City Council and seek permission to climb the bean. However, it is likely that you would need the approval of the police department, fire department, and any other department that has any control over the structure. Unfortunately, I doubt that it can be done, but if it is your dream to do so, you should follow your dream and attempt to get approval. You never know. While it is not probable, nothing is IMPOSSIBLE!
