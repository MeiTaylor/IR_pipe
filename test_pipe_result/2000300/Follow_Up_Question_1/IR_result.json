The first batch sold out.\nBriggs quickly lined up university bookstores across the country.\nSoon after, at a trade show, Briggs met Ned Kitchel, then a senior project manager at L.L. Bean.\nKitchel had been on the lookout for a daypack to hold textbooks ever since he received a suggestion letter from a Harvard Law student.\nAt his request, Briggs modified the Cricket to add a little more room on top — for your jacket or something — and brought it to him at L.L. Bean headquarters in Freeport, Maine.\nHe loved it. In 1982, the L.L. Bean catalogue featured the Book Pack, and it quickly became the company's top-selling product. \"It just exploded,\" Kitchel recalls. \"We were selling tens of thousands of them in almost no time.\"\nWhile the Book Pack conquered the East Coast, Skip Yowell and his team were gearing up for heavy production back in Seattle.\n\"The outdoor market was becoming saturated,\" Yowell said. \"We needed to move on to something a little different.\"\nIn 1984, JanSport released a new model, the Spring Break — the first one specifically for textbooks.

Make the backpacks bigger!\nThese newer models got serious about schoolwork. Deeper pockets. More compartments. Little zippered spaces.\nOf course, the school backpack has seen its troubles too, and even controversy.\nYou've probably seen articles about the health risks of kids weighed down by their backpacks. The American Chiropractic Association even wrote some guidelines to prevent \"backpack misuse.\" Wheeled packs became a popular option in response.\nThere have been security concerns, too — that backpacks can be used to smuggle weapons or drugs. Administrators at a few schools have gone so far as to require clear or mesh backpacks.\nNow,...[Content truncated]",

The Three Sisters are represented by corn, beans, and squash and they’re an important facet of Indigenous culture and foodways. They’re planted in a symbiotic triad where beans are planted at the base of the corn stalks. The stalks offer climbing bean vines support as they reach for sunlight from the earth. The beans, in turn, pump beneficial nitrogen back into the soil, fertilizing the corn and squash, while the squash's broad, spiny leaves protect the bean plants from predatory animals.\nThe Three Sisters also offer spiritual connection and appear in mythology across tribes, from the Hopis of the Southwest to the Oneidas of the Midwest and the Iroquois in the Northeast, but my personal connection to these staple crops is removed from this mythology and tradition.\nLike many Native Americans, I grew up largely separated from traditional Navajo culture, ceremony, agriculture and Indigenous food. The separation occurred generations ago and it is only recently that I’ve started a journey back into the traditions of my ancestors. However, that doesn’t mean The Three...[Content truncated]",

However, if you have a \"good\" reason, a safety plan, and a way to use materials that won't scratch or otherwise injure the structure, you COULD go to the City Council and seek permission to climb the bean. However, it is likely that you would need the approval of the police department, fire department, and any other department that has any control over the structure. Unfortunately, I doubt that it can be done, but if it is your dream to do so, you should follow your dream and attempt to get approval. You never know.

The sculpture and Grainger Plaza are located on top of Park Grill, between the Chase Promenade and McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink. Constructed between 2004 and 2006, the sculpture is nicknamed \"The Bean\" because of its shape, a name Kapoor later grew fond of. Kapoor himself even uses this title when referring to his work.[1] Made up of 168 stainless steel plates welded together, its highly polished exterior has no visible seams. It measures 33 by 66 by 42 feet (10 by 20 by 13 m), and weighs 110 short tons (100 t; 98 long tons).\n\nKapoor's design was inspired by liquid mercury and the sculpture's surface reflects and distorts the city's skyline. Visitors are able to walk around and under Cloud Gate's 12-foot (3.7 m) high arch. On the underside is the \"omphalos\" (Greek for \"navel\"), a concave chamber that warps and multiplies reflections. The sculpture builds upon many of Kapoor's artistic themes, and it is popular with tourists as a photo-taking opportunity for its unique reflective properties.\n\nThe sculpture was the result of a design competition....[Content truncated]",

Moreover, the \"bean\" is a work of art, and it is not meant to be climbed.  I certainly understand your desire to take some photos from on top of the bean, but the risks are too great to make it legal to climb. I'm sorry that I couldn't give you a more positive answer to your questions, however, the law is clear. I hope you find this information useful and that you PRESS THE GREEN ACCEPT BUTTON so that I can get credit for answering the question. Thank you.\nCustomer\nHow Can I legally climb the bean/cloud gate?\n]\nI don't believe that there is a way that you can legally climb the bean. However, if you have a \"good\" reason, a safety plan, and a way to use materials that won't scratch or otherwise injure the structure, you COULD go to the City Council and seek permission to climb the bean. However, it is likely that you would need the approval of the police department, fire department, and any other department that has any control over the structure. Unfortunately, I doubt that it can be done, but if it is your dream to do so, you should follow your dream and attempt to get approval. You never know. While it is not probable, nothing is IMPOSSIBLE!

            "content": "\n\nCloud Gate is a public sculpture by Indian-born British artist Anish Kapoor, that is the centerpiece of Grainger Plaza at Millennium Park in the Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois. The sculpture and Grainger Plaza are located on top of Park Grill, between the Chase Promenade and McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink. Constructed between 2004 and 2006, the sculpture is nicknamed \"The Bean\" because of its shape, a name Kapoor later grew fond of. Kapoor himself even uses this title when referring to his work.[1] Made up of 168 stainless steel plates welded together, its highly polished exterior has no visible seams. It measures 33 by 66 by 42 feet (10 by 20 by 13 m), and weighs 110 short tons (100 t; 98 long tons).\n\nKapoor's design was inspired by liquid mercury and the sculpture's surface reflects and distorts the city's skyline. Visitors are able to walk around and under Cloud Gate's 12-foot (3.7 m) high arch. On the underside is the \"omphalos\" (Greek for \"navel\"), a concave chamber that warps and multiplies reflections. The sculpture builds upon many of Kapoor's artistic themes, and it is popular with tourists as a photo-taking opportunity for its unique reflective properties.\n\nThe sculpture was the result of a design competition....[Content truncated]"

    "QA": {
        "Question": "What evidence exists to support or refute the claim of prior individuals climbing the Bean before this video?",
        "Answer": "To evaluate the claim of whether there were prior individuals who climbed the Bean (Cloud Gate) before the individual shown in the video, we can reference several pieces of evidence:\n\n1. **Public Accessibility and Interaction with the Sculpture**: The evidence indicates that Cloud Gate has been an interactive public art piece since its unveiling in 2005. Its design encourages engagement, and the environment surrounding it attracts crowds that appreciate and interact with the sculpture. However, while the level of interaction allows for activities such as climbing, there is no specific historical record noted in the sources that verifies instances of prior climbs before the individual in the video [Query2_evidence_3].\n\n2. **Legal Constraints**: According to a legal inquiry, climbing the Bean is generally considered illegal due to safety concerns, as authorities do not want individuals to risk injury by climbing on the sculpture. The city has taken steps to discourage this behavior, underscoring that the sculpture is not meant for climbing, which suggests that previous attempts might have occurred but would not have been officially acknowledged or recorded due to these legal restrictions [Query2_evidence_2].\n\n3. **General Public Attraction**: The Bean is described as a popular tourist attraction, known for its reflective surface and unique visual properties. Given the high foot traffic and the nature of public art, it is plausible that others have climbed the Bean prior to the man featured in the video, even if these occurrences were not publicly documented [Query2_evidence_1].\n\nIn summary, while the interactive nature of the Bean allows for possibilities of prior climbs, there is no concrete evidence to substantiate claims of specific individuals climbing it before the one depicted in the video. The lack of official documentation and the legal impediments contextually suggest that while it is feasible that prior climbs may have taken place, they remain undocumented due to safety regulations.",
