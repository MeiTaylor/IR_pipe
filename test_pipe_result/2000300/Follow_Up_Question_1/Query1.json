Her relationship with the tool that keeps her safe on a rock face has become more intimate. âYou get to see the inside of the rope, the core. Different colors in the interior of the strandsâand you see damage. You see parts of the rope that are normally hidden.â\nWhether sheâs choosing colors for a pattern or finding her next hold, making art and climbing require a similar dedication, Amy saidâa concentration that connects an artist or a climber to the land that provides their inspiration.\nWhatâs next for Amy Wicks? Well, sheâd like to do a three-dimensional piece, with wood and welding. You may have placed an order with her at the Mountain Rambler, but this summer sheâll be working with Inyo National Forest, doing wilderness patrol and working on trails. No doubt that trail time will inspire some new designs, Amy said. âItâll be good to be outside again.â\nYou wonât find Amy working in a studioâshe makes everything on the floor of her living room, which is heaped with rope. In other words, by making a purchase, you contribute to the accessibility of Amyâs furniture. She explained, âthe more art I make, the less rope my boyfriend has to deal with!â\nShe welcomes questions at (javascript:;).\nâI donât have a website because the community interaction is whatâs most important to me,â Amy said. Sheâd also be happy take your worn-out rope off your hands. Once youâre done with a rope, you can pass it along to Amy, instead of resigning it to the landfill.\nYou can find her work all along Main Street in Bishop: at Nuts & Twigs, the Mountain Rambler Brewery, Looney Bean, Black Sheep Coffee Roasters, Sierra Shanti (for yoga mat holders), and sometimes at the Inyo Council for The Arts.\nBetter yet, meet Amy and take a look at her wares (this Saturday, April 20, from 10am-3pm) in the park, during the Earth Day festivities. Come say hi at her table near the creek, close to Main Street.\nTagged:\n-------\n,   \nAbout the Author: Kendra Atleework\n----------------------------------\n!\nKendra Atleework is the author of , a book about the Eastern Sierra, which won the Sigurd F.

U.S. Department of Agriculture, \"in agricultural parlance, 'The Three Sisters' are crops planted together in a shared space: maize, beans, and squashâ¦. Developed through [I]ndigenous agricultural practices, these three plants protect and nourish each other in different ways as they grow and provide a solid diet for their cultivators.\" \nThe intercropping method of planting corn, beans, and squash together, commonly called The Three Sisters has been studied and described by scholars in anthropology, history, agriculture, and food studies for manyÂ  years. While this practice is often cited in current sources as a way to improve small gardens for individual use, its historical value lay in larger-scale implementations designed to nurture and sustain entire communities.\nThe great majority of this research has been created by scholars who were not members of the Indigenous communities which originally developed and maintained this tradition. Thus, this short review will strive to elevate Indigenous authors and practitioners whenever possible, while acknowledging the bulk of the available publications originate from work that did not center their voices.\nÂ \nDeoohako: Things That Sustain Us by Don Morfe, October 15, 2009.

I talked to Dave Baker and he gave good information about when it started. Like you mentioned, it started in the 1970 and it was with a can of bean that it was the only thing they have to eat at the moment. We are currently building a website with this information and try to gather as much and accurate information as we can. We are trying to collect a list of name of all the Bean Master for the website.

The sculpture and Grainger Plaza are located on top of Park Grill, between the Chase Promenade and McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink. Constructed between 2004 and 2006, the sculpture is nicknamed \"The Bean\" because of its shape, a name Kapoor later grew fond of. Kapoor himself even uses this title when referring to his work.[1] Made up of 168 stainless steel plates welded together, its highly polished exterior has no visible seams. It measures 33 by 66 by 42 feet (10 by 20 by 13Â m), and weighs 110 short tons (100Â t; 98 long tons).\n\nKapoor's design was inspired by liquid mercury and the sculpture's surface reflects and distorts the city's skyline. Visitors are able to walk around and under Cloud Gate's 12-foot (3.7Â m) high arch. On the underside is the \"omphalos\" (Greek for \"navel\"), a concave chamber that warps and multiplies reflections. The sculpture builds upon many of Kapoor's artistic themes, and it is popular with tourists as a photo-taking opportunity for its unique reflective properties.\n\nThe sculpture was the result of a design competition....[Content truncated]",

                    "content": "[Content truncated]....\nI have a 1916 magazine advertisement that shows a little black boy, softly caricatured,\n                  drinking from an ink bottle. The bottom caption reads, \"Nigger Milk.\" I bought the\n                  print in 1988 from an antique store in LaPorte, Indiana. It was framed and offered\n                  for sale at $20. The salesclerk wrote, \"Black Print,\" on the receipt. I told her to\n                  write, \"Nigger Milk Print.\"\n\"If you are going to sell it, call it by its name,\" I told her. She refused. We argued.\n                  I bought the print and left. That was my last argument with a dealer or sales clerk;\n                  today, I purchase the items and leave with little conversation.\nThe Mammy saltshaker and the \"Nigger Milk\" print are not the most offensive items\n                  that I have seen. In 1874, McLoughlin Brothers of New York manufactured a puzzle game\n                  called \"Chopped Up Niggers.\" Today, the game is a prized collectible. I have twice\n                  seen the game for sale; neither time did I have the $3,000 necessary to purchase it.\n                  There are postcards from the first half of the 20th century that show black people\n                  being whipped, or worse, hanging dead from trees, or lying on the ground burned beyond\n                  recognition. Postcards and photographs of lynched black people sell for around $400\n                  each on eBay and other Internet auction houses. I can afford to buy one, but I am\n                  not ready, not yet.\nMy friends claim that I am obsessed with racist objects. If they are right, the obsession\n                  began while I was an undergraduate student at Jarvis Christian College, a small historically\n                  black institution in Hawkins, Texas. The teachers taught more than scientific principles\n                  and mathematical equations. I learned from them what it was like to live as a black\n                  man under Jim Crow segregation. Imagine being a college professor but having to wear\n                  a chauffeur's hat while driving your new car through small towns, lest some disgruntled white man beat you for being \"uppity.\"\n                  The stories I heard were not angry ones; no, worse, they were matter-of-fact accounts\n                  of everyday life in a land where every black person was considered inferior to every\n                  white one, a time when \"social equality\" was a profane expression, fighting words.\n                  Black people knew their clothing sizes. Why? They were not allowed to try on clothes\n                  in department...[Content truncated]",

The first batch sold out.\nBriggs quickly lined up university bookstores across the country.\nSoon after, at a trade show, Briggs met Ned Kitchel, then a senior project manager at L.L. Bean.\nKitchel had been on the lookout for a daypack to hold textbooks ever since he received a suggestion letter from a Harvard Law student.\nAt his request, Briggs modified the Cricket to add a little more room on top â for your jacket or something â and brought it to him at L.L. Bean headquarters in Freeport, Maine.\nHe loved it. In 1982, the L.L. Bean catalogue featured the Book Pack, and it quickly became the company's top-selling product. \"It just exploded,\" Kitchel recalls. \"We were selling tens of thousands of them in almost no time.\"\nWhile the Book Pack conquered the East Coast, Skip Yowell and his team were gearing up for heavy production back in Seattle.\n\"The outdoor market was becoming saturated,\" Yowell said. \"We needed to move on to something a little different.\"\nIn 1984, JanSport released a new model, the Spring Break â the first one specifically for textbooks. It spread throughout the West as fast as L.L. Bean's was taking over in the East.\nThe rest is history. Within a few years, backpacks had gone from novelty to necessity. Competitors popped up, too.\nL.L. Bean's Book Pack became the Deluxe Book Pack, and JanSport's Spring Break transformed into the SuperBreak.\nOver the years the styles haven't changed much. A few adaptations here and there: Some for function, some for fashion.\nBy the late 1980s, nearly every kid walking to school was wearing a backpack. So the only thing left to do? Make the backpacks bigger!\nThese newer models got serious about schoolwork. Deeper pockets. More compartments. Little zippered spaces.\nOf course, the school backpack has seen its troubles too, and even controversy.\nYou've probably seen articles about the health risks of kids weighed down by their backpacks. The American Chiropractic Association even wrote some guidelines to prevent \"backpack misuse.\" Wheeled packs became a popular option in response.\nThere have been security concerns, too â that backpacks can be used to smuggle weapons or drugs. Administrators at a few schools have gone so far as to require clear or mesh backpacks.\nNow,...[Content truncated]",

Among legumes, the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) probably plays the leading role in typifying these attributes. This species has also shown a remarkable ability to spread around the globe and to replace similar local species in virtually all the cuisines of the world, being nowadays embodied in the gastronomy of several countries. Attitudes toward beans are changing recently, and this legume is no longer considered as only the meat of the poor. This review aims to present a critical overview of the history and role in the gastronomy of common bean and other main cultivated legumes in Italy. After presenting the origin of common bean and its name, and the impact of its introduction to Europe, this contribution discusses the gastronomic history of beans in Italy and the role that socio-cultural differences have played in shaping the use of b",

Finally, perspectives are discussed considering the recent trends in gastronomy and food tourism.\nThe origin of the name in the Western culture and of the common bean\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe cultivation of legumes goes back to the Neolithic Age and the dawn of agriculture \\:175â9.\")\\]. Beans likely became an integral part of the human diet with the development of agricultural techniques such as irrigation and companion planting, considering the indeterminate climbing growth habit of the species. Beans are already cited in the Old Testament of the Holy Bible (cf. Ezekiel, 4,9). However, the word âbeanâ has been used liberally, without a specific botanical connotation, as is still the case today. For example, in the epic poem Iliad \\\\], the oldest surviving work of Greek literature, the âdark fava beansâ (ÎºÏÎ±Î¼Î¿Î¹ Î¼ÎµÎ»Î±Î½ÏÏÏÎ¿ÎµÏ) have been translated sometimes as âdark (common) bean.â Beans are described in ancient Greek under the name of _dolichos_ (e.g., by Theophrastus, the father of botany) and _fasiolos_ (e.g., by Dioscorides). The corresponding Latin words are _faseolis_ (cf. _Caelius Apicius, De Re Coquinaria_ 8.6.1.2) and _phaselus/faselus_ (cf. Publius Vergilius Maro, Georgica 1.227; L.

The Three Sisters are represented by corn, beans, and squash and theyâre an important facet of Indigenous culture and foodways. Theyâre planted in a symbiotic triad where beans are planted at the base of the corn stalks. The stalks offer climbing bean vines support as they reach for sunlight from the earth. The beans, in turn, pump beneficial nitrogen back into the soil, fertilizing the corn and squash, while the squash's broad, spiny leaves protect the bean plants from predatory animals.\nThe Three Sisters also offer spiritual connection and appear in mythology across tribes, from the Hopis of the Southwest to the Oneidas of the Midwest and the Iroquois in the Northeast, but my personal connection to these staple crops is removed from this mythology and tradition.\nLike many Native Americans, I grew up largely separated from traditional Navajo culture, ceremony, agriculture and Indigenous food. The separation occurred generations ago and it is only recently that Iâve started a journey back into the traditions of my ancestors. However, that doesnât mean The Three...[Content truncated]",
