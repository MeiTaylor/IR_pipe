The sculpture and Grainger Plaza are located on top of Park Grill, between the Chase Promenade and McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink. Constructed between 2004 and 2006, the sculpture is nicknamed \"The Bean\" because of its shape, a name Kapoor later grew fond of. Kapoor himself even uses this title when referring to his work.[1] Made up of 168 stainless steel plates welded together, its highly polished exterior has no visible seams. It measures 33 by 66 by 42 feet (10 by 20 by 13 m), and weighs 110 short tons (100 t; 98 long tons).\n\nKapoor's design was inspired by liquid mercury and the sculpture's surface reflects and distorts the city's skyline. Visitors are able to walk around and under Cloud Gate's 12-foot (3.7 m) high arch. On the underside is the \"omphalos\" (Greek for \"navel\"), a concave chamber that warps and multiplies reflections. The sculpture builds upon many of Kapoor's artistic themes, and it is popular with tourists as a photo-taking opportunity for its unique reflective properties.\n\nThe sculpture was the result of a design competition....[Content truncated]",

Celebrated architects like Frank Lloyd Wright and Louis Sullivan flocked here to build the city that we know today. Alongside architecture, public art has been a fixture of Chicago aesthetics for decades. The city’s public art includes some exemplary pieces of modernist art. Here are the stories behind four sculptures that define public art in downtown Chicago.\nTHE PICASSO\n-----------\nDesigned by Pablo Picasso in 1967, this piece is technically unnamed, but is colloquially referred to as “the Picasso.” It was one of the first public sculptures to be placed downtown and sits in Daley Plaza inside the Loop. Commissioned by the architects of the Richard J. Daley Center, Picasso refused the payment for the piece, instead creating the sculpture as a gift to the city of Chicago. The Picasso looks a bit like a jungle gym and it is not uncommon to see visitors of the plaza climbing on and around the sculpture.\nALEXANDER CALDER’S FLAMINGO\n---------------------------\nHead a few blocks south in the Loop and you will find yourself dwarfed by the _Flamingo_, a large vermillion abstract sculpture sitting in the Federal Plaza. Alexander Calder designed this sculpture in 1974, clocking in at an epic weight of 50 tons. Calder wanted his sculpture to wind and arch, a curving pop of color surrounded by monumental steel buildings. _Flamingo_ was the first sculpture to be unveiled under the Percent for Art program—a program which administers a percentage of the city budget to public art.\n!\nLeft: Pablo Picasso, Untitled, 1967. Right: Alexander Calder, _Flamingo_, 1974.\nJOAN MIRO’S CHICAGO\n----------------------\nDown the street from Picasso’s sculpture is a work by contemporary master Joan Miró, fittingly titled _Chicago_. This piece was unveiled in Brunswick Plaza by Chicago’s first female mayor Jane Byrne in 1981. Miró’s sculpture is a 40-foot statue of a woman tucked between two skyscrapers. It is a mixed media sculpture—steel,...[Content truncated]",

Just as early European settlers had observed Mohawks walking fearlessly across rivers on narrow logs, early ironworkers showed an unusual aptitude for climbing and working on steel beams. Having once hunted, trapped and farmed throughout the northeast woodlands, the Mohawks of the Haudenosaunee, or Iroquois Confederacy, eventually took to the high steel in burgeoning metropolitan areas. These indigenous riveting gangs spoke their native languages on the job while helping to build the Chrysler Building, Empire State Building, Rockefeller Plaza and many other structures that shaped the New York City skyline in the 1920s and 1930s. \nThe Skywalker tradition nearly came to an end in 1907 when 33 Mohawk men from Kahnawake died during a collapse of the Quebec Bridge near Quebec City. More than two-thirds of these men were married, leaving behind dozens of children and 24 widows. The resilient Skywalkers rebounded, but only after Mohawk women demanded that they not work together in family groups. They would instead work in dispersed riveting gangs, lest another disaster wipe out such a wide swath of one family. \nBeauvais said it was typical for women to call the shots. “Women always chose the chiefs because they lived in matrilineal clans and saw the boys grow up,” she said. “They would choose leaders because they knew about their boys’ characteristics from infancy to manhood.”\nWhat began as a high-paying vocation became a tribal tradition as fathers and grandfathers taught their sons and grandsons to handle their fears effectively. The Skywalker tradition was passed down for many generations as Mohawks worked the high steel from Ontario to Chicago and Philadelphia, and as far away as San Francisco. They even established a neighborhood of their own in Brooklyn, New York.\nCheck out 10 little‑known facts about one of the United States’ most iconic skyscrapers. \nThe constitutional framers may have viewed Indigenous people of the Iroquois Confederacy as inferior, but that didn't stop them from admiring their federalist principles.\nLong before Christopher Columbus stepped foot on what would come to be known as the Americas, the expansive territory was inhabited by Native Americans. Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, as more explorers sought to colonize their land, Native Americans responded in various stages, from cooperation to indignation to revolt. After siding with the French […]\nBy 1960 Atlantic Avenue and the Boerum Hill area of Brooklyn was home to about 800 Mohawk iron...[Content truncated]",

The first batch sold out.\nBriggs quickly lined up university bookstores across the country.\nSoon after, at a trade show, Briggs met Ned Kitchel, then a senior project manager at L.L. Bean.\nKitchel had been on the lookout for a daypack to hold textbooks ever since he received a suggestion letter from a Harvard Law student.\nAt his request, Briggs modified the Cricket to add a little more room on top — for your jacket or something — and brought it to him at L.L. Bean headquarters in Freeport, Maine.\nHe loved it. In 1982, the L.L. Bean catalogue featured the Book Pack, and it quickly became the company's top-selling product. \"It just exploded,\" Kitchel recalls. \"We were selling tens of thousands of them in almost no time.\"\nWhile the Book Pack conquered the East Coast, Skip Yowell and his team were gearing up for heavy production back in Seattle.\n\"The outdoor market was becoming saturated,\" Yowell said. \"We needed to move on to something a little different.\"\nIn 1984, JanSport released a new model, the Spring Break — the first one specifically for textbooks. It spread throughout the West as fast as L.L. Bean's was taking over in the East.\nThe rest is history. Within a few years, backpacks had gone from novelty to necessity.

A few adaptations here and there: Some for function, some for fashion.\nBy the late 1980s, nearly every kid walking to school was wearing a backpack. So the only thing left to do? Make the backpacks bigger!\nThese newer models got serious about schoolwork. Deeper pockets. More compartments. Little zippered spaces.\nOf course, the school backpack has seen its troubles too, and even controversy.\nYou've probably seen articles about the health risks of kids weighed down by their backpacks. The American Chiropractic Association even wrote some guidelines to prevent \"backpack misuse.\" Wheeled packs became a popular option in response.\nThere have been security concerns, too — that backpacks can be used to smuggle weapons or drugs. Administrators at a few schools have gone so far as to require clear or mesh backpacks.\nNow,...[Content truncated]",
