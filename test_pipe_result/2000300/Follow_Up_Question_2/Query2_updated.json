Here are two of the large single set stairways on this traverse, Oriole and East Aerial:\n!\nNote the inlaid street and path name in the concrete on the left image above, and that the 6 mile mark of the route is at the top of the Oriole stairway.\nContinuing onward toward Grand View Park, the route descends two large stairways, before heading west toward the park on Moraga St, on the east side. The view from here is nice in that you can see the East Moraga stairway, and the continuation up into the park that was descended early in the walk:  \n!\nThe inscription on the large retaining wall reads: MORAGA ST, GOLDEN GATE HEIGHTS.  \nFrom the top of the first two stairways in this set, we head to the right northward, avoiding the upper stairway we descended earlier in the day, heading back toward the start, passing the 7 mile mark before the first (short, 20 down-steps) of the final two stairways. The final stairway is on 15th street, and has a whopping 193 steps, with fantastic views of the norther parts of central San Francisco, and here are a few photos of that descent:  \n!!\nThe lower composite photo is the view from about 100 steps down from the top of the 15th St stairway.

Seattle Pacific University is at the northern end of the Queen Anne region, so at this point in the walk, I have gone more than half-way around the hill, traversed 74 of 108 total stairways, with 2,577 of 4,121 up-steps completed. After lunch on my way out of the campus, I climbed a rather interesting stairway configuration that climbs out of a multi-level parking lot on a hillside, that made for a good photo op, both from the bottom and the top as you can see in these two photos:\n!\nLooking up the Seattle Pacific University parking lot stairway\n!\nLooking down the parking lot stairway, and the view of the campus and surrounding hills\nUnfortunately for me, the next stairway was closed for upgrades, so I decided to add another stairway at Florentina and 1st, that was not on my planned route, and it turned out to be quite amusing, since the school served by the stairway has a playful mural of land and marine life on a pair of retaining walls as can be seen in this three photo composite:\n!\nThe mural at Florentina & 1st. The animal eyes look stoned! It must be all that legal weed!\nThe artwork above is by prolific Seattle muralist, Ryan \u201c\u201d Ward.\nContinuing eastward I climbed two more stairways, the second of which was a nice long shaded wooden stairway in Mayfair park, then a bit further northeast just past the 11 mile mark, I reach my first approach toward Lake Union (though I could not see the water), and a view of the truss/arch design Aurora Bridge that crosses over an inlet of the lake:\n!\nA panorama shot of the Truss/Arch Aurora Bridge that crosses over Lake Union\nThere was another stairway on Fulton, just to the right of the above panorama image, that makes the southward bend to follow the shore of Lake Union, in a SE direction. This means I am now heading toward the large stairways to come in the last part of the walk.\n### The Home Stretch\nThe last 5 miles of the walk builds up to a...[Content truncated]",

The heat had become truly oppressive, and would turn into an oven right after that as the canyon narrowed, so we took a break with them and chatted. We later saw them at the river where they camped and we refilled our water bladders.\nThe temperature in the narrow part of Red Canyon was well over 100 degrees and felt much hotter. I remembered thinking that I didn\u2019t expect that much heat, or to feel it getting to me so quickly. It was a heavy, palpable thing.\nThe river was a wondrous thing, cold and wholly out of place in the heat-distorted canyon. I\u2019m not sure I was dehydrated at this point. We had been drinking a lot and we took in a lot of fresh, cold water. I just know that I had not taken in any electrolytes or salts because I didn\u2019t have any.\nBelow, you can see the trail segment from the Colorado River to campground 1. Google Maps will not show the complete correct trail before or after this part of the Tonto for some reason (I blame the squirrels), so I can\u2019t show the full distance from start to finish\u2013a common problem with Google in the backcountry (Don\u2019t rely on it).\n### Colorado River to Campground I under Horseshoe Mesa\nI can\u2019t say I felt great on the hike up the river on the Tonto Trail as we started the long, climbing contour toward the bottom of Horseshoe Mesa, but I didn\u2019t feel any worse than I often do for random reasons. We just hiked and hiked and waited for the sun to go down. When it dipped behind the Canyon walls, the temperature dropped and our spirits lifted in perfect synchrony. This was more like it.\nWe made camp under a darkling purple sky, had a little food and water, and settled in.\nWell, first we had to build a tiny stone food storage facility because the General Store had only had one medium sized mesh bag. We started with large rocks, then filled in the cracks then the holes until you could have stored water in there. You know, if we had some. In the morning, the food was 99.5% fine, but one little varmint had squirmed through the rocks, nibbled through my Sil bag, through a Ziploc, through a wrapper, and taken the tiniest little bite of a Starburst. Kudos.\nI was a little baffled by what happened to my body after we lay down. I had taken in food, including salty snacks and water. The temperature had dropped from hot to warm and quite pleasant. I felt like I should have been recovering.\nWhat happened instead...[Content truncated]",

I thought I knew what a desert felt like, smelled like. I'd spent a lot of time in them in Colorado and Utah, but this was Nevada - LAS VEGAS - where nothing is half assed.

This trip occurred after the Park experienced a wet period and, as a result, we were treated to what was termed a \u201cSuper Bloom.\u201d This involved a once-in-a-decade bloom of wildflowers.\nIt is a 10-12 hour drive from Boise to the region around Death Valley, depending upon your stopping point. On Day 1 (February 20th), our destination was the base of Mount Jackson which is located north of Beatty. The drive took us 11 hours. We set up camp at the base of Mount Jackson as the sun set. On Day 2, we climbed Mount Jackson, Mount Dunfee and Peak 6413. Mount Jackson (6,412 feet) was the most distinctive peak we climbed. A band of cliffs completely surrounds the peak\u2019s plateau-like summit. Our roundabout route took us to the summit with minimal Class 3 climbing.\nOne of the most interesting cultural elements of the region is the mining history coupled with the modern-day humans that live in many of the ruins of abandoned mining towns. The next 2 peaks are located next to Gold Point (NV). I\u2019m not sure how many people live full-time in this ramshackle pueblo but there were 2 bars and scores of vehicles parked here.\nCamping below Jackson Peak.\n\nClimbing through the Jackson Peak cliffs.\nMount Dunfee (7,030 feet) is located east of town. It was an easy Class 2 climb that is 4 miles round trip. From the summit of Mount Dunfee, we saw Peak 6413 sitting to the west of Gold Fork. It was a short climb\u2013less than a mile round trip. The crux of the climb was determining which road was the correct approach.\nThe 2nd summit of the day.\nA February Moon.\nOn Day 3, we climbed Sawtooth Mountain, West Sawtooth Peak, Bullfrog Mountain, Burton Mountain and Velvet Peak. All 5 of these peaks are situated around the Rhyolite ghost town west of Beatty. I think it is safe to say that any peak named Sawtooth is going to be attractive to a mountain climber. This Sawtooth Mountain (6,005 feet) is no exception. It is a sharp, tooth-shaped summit. Unlike most peaks named \u201cSawtooth,\u201d this peak has electronic facilities near its summit and a steep, rugged 4WD road leading to the top.\nWe walked up the road, which ends at the peak\u2019s summit block.

The seminar turned out to be our future guide \u201cSandeep\u201d talking about his new adventure company,Miyar adventures and how they were taking a few people up Kilimanjaro. The whole thing sounded fairly exciting and challenging and I automatically registered Kili in my bucket list. It was only almost a year later that we decided to finally do it.\n\u00a0\nI had a miscarriage earlier in the year 2015 and P with his ever encouraging spirit had said, let\u2019s do something else life changing this year :-) and so we decided to climb Kilimanjaro.\n\u00a0\nAnd so we started to prepare for Kilimanjaro in September of 2015. We knew some basic details. It would be a 7 day climb, reaching a maximum altitude of 19,300 feet. I did not want to know too many details about the climb because I felt it would scare me off. I knew so little that I thought we only had to climb up to the top and then there would be jeep that would bring us down, similar to how we had done Macchu Picchu last year. Fortunately I figured out in time that was not the case.\n\u00a0\nTraining started in ernest, with us wracking up as many hiking miles as we possibly could. We caught up with a few other people of the group who were way more planned than us and had chalked out multiple hikes that they would be doing over the next three months to get ready. We had actually never hiked in the fall season in the pacific northwest, so the views came as wonderful surprise. My main form of training became \u201cHatha Yoga\u201c. that I had just learnt in August and the weekend hikes.
