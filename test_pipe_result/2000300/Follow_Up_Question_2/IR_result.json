The heat had become truly oppressive, and would turn into an oven right after that as the canyon narrowed, so we took a break with them and chatted. We later saw them at the river where they camped and we refilled our water bladders.\nThe temperature in the narrow part of Red Canyon was well over 100 degrees and felt much hotter. I remembered thinking that I didn’t expect that much heat, or to feel it getting to me so quickly. It was a heavy, palpable thing.\nThe river was a wondrous thing, cold and wholly out of place in the heat-distorted canyon. I’m not sure I was dehydrated at this point. We had been drinking a lot and we took in a lot of fresh, cold water. I just know that I had not taken in any electrolytes or salts because I didn’t have any.\nBelow, you can see the trail segment from the Colorado River to campground 1. Google Maps will not show the complete correct trail before or after this part of the Tonto for some reason (I blame the squirrels), so I can’t show the full distance from start to finish–a common problem with Google in the backcountry (Don’t rely on it).\n### Colorado River to Campground I under Horseshoe Mesa\nI can’t say I felt great on the hike up the river on the Tonto Trail as we started the long, climbing contour toward the bottom of Horseshoe Mesa, but I didn’t feel any worse than I often do for random reasons. We just hiked and hiked and waited for the sun to go down. When it dipped behind the Canyon walls, the temperature dropped and our spirits lifted in perfect synchrony. This was more like it.\nWe made camp under a darkling purple sky, had a little food and water, and settled in.\nWell, first we had to build a tiny stone food storage facility because the General Store had only had one medium sized mesh bag. We started with large rocks, then filled in the cracks then the holes until you could have stored water in there. You know, if we had some. In the morning, the food was 99.5% fine, but one little varmint had squirmed through the rocks, nibbled through my Sil bag, through a Ziploc, through a wrapper, and taken the tiniest little bite of a Starburst. Kudos.\nI was a little baffled by what happened to my body after we lay down. I had taken in food, including salty snacks and water. The temperature had dropped from hot to warm and quite pleasant. I felt like I should have been recovering.\nWhat happened instead...[Content truncated]",

        "Question": "What timelines or events could verify the historical context of climbing the Bean sculpture prior to this video?",
        "Answer": "To verify the historical context of climbing the Bean sculpture (Cloud Gate) prior to the video in question, we can consider several timelines and events based on available evidence:\n\n1. **Unveiling and Public Accessibility**: Cloud Gate was unveiled in 2005 and has since been a significant public art installation in Millennium Park, attracting visitors from around the world. Its design encourages interaction, which implies that climbing or similar activities could have occurred shortly after its unveiling, as the sculpture is situated in an area with high foot traffic and is easily accessible to the public [Query1_evidence2].\n\n2. **Surrounding Events and Activities**: Millennium Park hosts a variety of public events and gatherings throughout the year. These events draw large crowds, providing ample opportunity for spontaneous interactions with the sculpture, including attempts to climb. Engaging with the sculpture in this manner might not be officially recorded but is plausible, given the atmosphere of public interaction [Query1_evidence1].\n\n3. **Legal Context and Enforcement**: There are legal restrictions against climbing the Bean, which suggests that even if prior attempts were made, they would not have been recorded or promoted due to safety concerns. Legal notices about climbing could date back to the sculpture's opening, providing a timeline when the activity drew attention from authorities [Query1_evidence1].\n\n4. **Public Attraction and Popularity**: Given the Bean's popularity as an iconic tourist attraction, it is likely that informal climbing attempts occurred even before the video was recorded. A culture of playful interaction with such public artworks often develops, leading to undocumented activities prior to any specific instance that might gain notoriety [Query1_evidence3].\n\n5. **Historical Records**: To substantiate specific instances of climbing prior to the moment captured in the video, one could look into local news archives, social media posts, or community forums that date back to the time after the Bean's unveiling. Such archives could contain mentions of activities, events, or challenges that might include climbing the sculpture before it became widely publicized in the Reddit post associated with the video [Query1_evidence1].\n\nIn summary, while no concrete evidence of earlier climbs exists, the combination of the Bean's interactive design, its status as a popular gathering spot, and the legal context suggests that climbing prior to the video is plausible. Without specific documented instances, these elements serve primarily as contextual support for the possibility of climbing occurring before the video was made.",
