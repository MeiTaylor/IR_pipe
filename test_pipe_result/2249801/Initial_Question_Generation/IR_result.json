        "Question": "Does the video feature Amy Winehouse as a child or Angelina Jordan at age eight?",
        "Answer": "The video clearly features Angelina Jordan at age eight, not Amy Winehouse as a child. The title of the video is \"Wow! Angelina Jordan (8): 'What a Difference a Day Make,'\" which directly indicates that Angelina Jordan is the subject of the performance at the age of eight. Additionally, Angelina Jordan is a Norwegian singer who gained fame after her audition for \"Norway's Got Talent\" in 2014, making her notable at that young age. Furthermore, there is no evidence suggesting that Amy Winehouse, a well-known British singer who passed away in 2011, sang in the video mentioned. The claim about Amy Winehouse seems to be misleading or incorrect given that the evidence points clearly to Angelina Jordan.",
