    "QA": {
        "Question": "What specific evidence confirms the age and identity of the singer in the video apart from the title?",
        "Answer": "The claim states that the video shows a \"10-year-old Amy Winehouse\" singing \"What a Difference a Day Makes.\" However, the video information provided does not support this claim. Instead, it describes a performance by a young girl identified as Angelina Jordan, who is said to be 8 years old (as per the video headline). Specific evidence that confirms the age and identity of the singer in the video includes: 1. **Video Headline**: The headline explicitly states that Angelina Jordan, who was 8 years old at the time of the video posting, performed the song \"What a Difference a Day Makes.\" 2. **Video Transcript**: The transcript of the performance does not mention Amy Winehouse but aligns with the performance given by the young singer, further supporting that the artist is indeed Angelina Jordan. 3. **Description**: The video descriptor narrates the scene in detail, focusing on the young girl with a flower crown singing on stage. There is no indication or reference to Amy Winehouse in this description, which centers on the performance of the girl identified as Angelina. Based on this evidence, it is clear that the singer in the video is Angelina Jordan, not Amy Winehouse, and she is 8 years old during the recording of the performance.",
