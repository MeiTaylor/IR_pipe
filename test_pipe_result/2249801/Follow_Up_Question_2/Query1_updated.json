She also writes regularly in her journal, part of which was later turned into a book. More on that below. She speaks several languages. For years she has been covering other artists and is now starting to record her own songs.\n**Enters Norway\u2019s Got Talent at 7 years old and wins**\n]\nIn these earlier videos, it is totally incongruous to see such a small young child performing old American jazz standards on Norway\u2019s Got Talent.

Like, the way it makes you feel things you had forgotten about. Or how it makes you feel empathy for your\u00a0_parents_ even though\u00a0they drive you crazy. Plus it totally makes you start talking like a teenager again.\nTo put it simply: this show is one of the best representations of teenagers and growing up there is (even if you\u2019re growing up at age 40, like her parents seem to be doing). The main character is Angela Chase, 15 (the natural and transcendent Claire Danes). She begins the series by ditching her lifelong \u201cgood\u201d friend Sharon (Devon Odessa) for the rebellious Rayanne (A.J. Langer), who encourages her to dye her hair. See, her hair was holding her back.\nWith the bright-red new hair and Rayanne\u2019s encouragement \u2013 and that of Rayanne\u2019s BFF, sweetheart Rickie (Wilson Cruz) \u2013 Angela starts to pursue her\u00a0_intense_\u00a0crush, Jordan Catalano (Jared Leto \u2013 yeah, that Jared Leto). When she\u2019s not navigating her friendships and halting hookups, Angela has her family to deal with \u2013 her parents and little sister, Danielle (Lisa Wilhoit) \u2013 as well as annoying teachers and the even more annoying \u201cboy next door,\u201d \u00a0Brian Krakow (Devon Gummersall) \u2013 who is himself helplessly neurotic and hopelessly in love with Angela. You know, just your typical teenage stuff. Every episode \u2013 except two, which have alternate perspectives \u2013 has a voice-over by Angela, so we _really_ get into her mind and get to sink back into that teenage view of the world.\nThe early episodes lean a bit more towards the \u201cmessage per week\u201d...[Content truncated]",

Isn\u2019t it?\nPontus: Why so?\nAlan: Well two becomes three tonight.\nPontus: Oh, you mean we have a guest?\nAlan: I can see him in front of me.\nChris: Okay! Hello there, all the way here from Hawaii.\nAlan: Yeah, halfway around the world. Welcome to the show, Chris. I feel like we\u2019re old friends already, although this is the first time I have spoken to you directly.  \nWe have one big thing in common, which is going to be the subject of our podcast.\nPontus: What is that?\nAlan: A Norwegian girl who is rather special and absorbs much of our time and consciousness.  \nSo Chris when did you first hear Angelina?\nChris: My wife really likes to watch a lot of YouTube clips on our big TV. And we were watching a collection of Golden Buzzer moments from America\u2019s Got Talent. And so I saw one of her biggest ones, Bohemian Rhapsody, and my thought was, wow, this is easily the best thing I\u2019ve ever heard on America\u2019s Got Talent.  \nAnd the first impression was just Wow this is..! How old is she? which you hear so many other people describe when they first hear her.\nAlan: The brilliance about her Bohemian Rhapsody performance is that some moments she gives the big, powerful, booming voice that most people associate with great singers, but there are other times where her voice goes quiet and sensitive. And so she has a full range of skills all within those two minutes.  \nAnd it\u2019s the variations within two or three or four seconds. It\u2019s how quickly and how subtly they can change. And I think that is why we very ardent Angelina Jordan fans can listen to her over and over and over again because the variation constantly surprises us.  \nAnd that\u2019s why people don\u2019t get jaded emotionally from hearing her and they recreate that emotional reaction.\nChris: I heard Bohemian Rhapsody and one of the very next ones I heard was Summertime, an entirely different genre and style of singing. And then shortly after that, I heard...[Content truncated]",
