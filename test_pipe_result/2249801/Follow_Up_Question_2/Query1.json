The more I found out about her, the more I wanted to hear her sing and uncover more of her story. This would account for the length and breadth of this new post. There‚Äôs enough here to keep you informed, inspired, and entertained at your own pace.\n**_I want to sing for the whole world. Singing is as important as breathing to me. I just love to sing._ _‚Äî_ Angelina Jordan**\nI recently discovered and am thoroughly enjoying listening to an amazingly talented young artist‚ÄîAngelina Jordan Astar from Oslo, Norway. Born January 10, 2006, this musical child prodigy started singing very early in life.\nThanks to her maternal grandmother, Mery Zamani, Angelina began listening to classic American jazz artists when she was a very young child. She started singing around  and by 3 knew that‚Äôs what she wanted to do with her life‚Äîbecome an international singing superstar. ()\nLuckily, her family has supported her in that direction. As a young child, Angelina attended the Oslo Waldorf School and participated in the Oslo School of Music and Performing Arts after-school program where she received vocal training.\nIn addition to singing, she also learned how to play 4 instruments‚Äîpiano, violin, guitar, and flute‚Äîand she paints! She also writes regularly in her journal, part of which was later turned into a book. More on that below. She speaks several languages. For years she has been covering other artists and is now starting to record her own songs.\n**Enters Norway‚Äôs Got Talent at 7 years old and wins**\n]\nIn these earlier videos, it is totally incongruous to see such a small young child performing old American jazz standards on Norway‚Äôs Got Talent. For her audition she sang . The judges could not believe what they were hearing. Some were at a loss for words; others were te...[Content truncated]",

Since then she has worked to raise money on behalf of environmental causes and various children's charities. She always performs barefoot, after befriending a young shoeless girl and giving her shoes to her. Jordan later wrote a book about the experience, Mellom to hjerter (Between Two Hearts).\n\nJordan has released multiple digital singles and EPs, and one full-length album called It's Magic. She appeared on the first season of Little Big Shots in 2016, and the second season of America's Got Talent: The Champions in 2020, where her cover version of Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" brought her much attention.\n\nJordan has lived in the United States since 2018. In August 2020, it was announced that she has signed with Republic Records.[2] Her first single under that label, \"Million Miles\", was released in November 2020.[3]\n\nAfter Jordan's performances of two Billie Holiday songs, \"Gloomy Sunday\" and \"I'm a Fool to Want You...[Content truncated]",

Like, the way it makes you feel things you had forgotten about. Or how it makes you feel empathy for your¬†_parents_ even though¬†they drive you crazy. Plus it totally makes you start talking like a teenager again.\nTo put it simply: this show is one of the best representations of teenagers and growing up there is (even if you‚Äôre growing up at age 40, like her parents seem to be doing). The main character is Angela Chase, 15 (the natural and transcendent Claire Danes). She begins the series by ditching her lifelong ‚Äúgood‚Äù friend Sharon (Devon Odessa) for the rebellious Rayanne (A.J. Langer), who encourages her to dye her hair. See, her hair was holding her back.\nWith the bright-red new hair and Rayanne‚Äôs encouragement ‚Äì and that of Rayanne‚Äôs BFF, sweetheart Rickie (Wilson Cruz) ‚Äì Angela starts to pursue her¬†_intense_¬†crush, Jordan Catalano (Jared Leto ‚Äì yeah, that Jared Leto). When she‚Äôs not navigating her friendships and halting hookups, Angela has her family to deal with ‚Äì her parents and little sister, Danielle (Lisa Wilhoit) ‚Äì as well as annoying teachers and the even more annoying ‚Äúboy next door,‚Äù ¬†Brian Krakow (Devon Gummersall) ‚Äì who is himself helplessly neurotic and hopelessly in love with Angela. You know, just your typical teenage stuff. Every episode ‚Äì except two, which have alternate perspectives ‚Äì has a voice-over by Angela, so we _really_ get into her mind and get to sink back into that teenage view of the world.\nThe early episodes lean a bit more towards the ‚Äúmessage per week‚Äù...[Content truncated]",

And I think that is why we very ardent Angelina Jordan fans can listen to her over and over and over again because the variation constantly surprises us.  \nAnd that‚Äôs why people don‚Äôt get jaded emotionally from hearing her and they recreate that emotional reaction.\nChris: I heard Bohemian Rhapsody and one of the very next ones I heard was Summertime, an entirely different genre and style of singing.
