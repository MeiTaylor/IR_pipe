There’s enough here to keep you informed, inspired, and entertained at your own pace.\n**_I want to sing for the whole world. Singing is as important as breathing to me. I just love to sing._ _—_ Angelina Jordan**\nI recently discovered and am thoroughly enjoying listening to an amazingly talented young artist—Angelina Jordan Astar from Oslo, Norway. Born January 10, 2006, this musical child prodigy started singing very early in life.\nThanks to her maternal grandmother, Mery Zamani, Angelina began listening to classic American jazz artists when she was a very young child. She started singing around  and by 3 knew that’s what she wanted to do with her life—become an international singing superstar. ()\nLuckily, her family has supported her in that direction. As a young child, Angelina attended the Oslo Waldorf School and participated in the Oslo School of Music and Performing Arts after-school program where she received vocal training.\nIn addition to singing, she also learned how to play 4 instruments—piano, violin, guitar, and flute—and she paints! She also writes regularly in her journal, part of which was later turned into a book. More on that below. She speaks several languages. For years she has been covering other artists and is now starting to record her own songs.\n**Enters Norway’s Got Talent at 7 years old and wins**\n]\nIn these earlier videos, it is totally incongruous to see such a small young child performing old American jazz standards on Norway’s Got Talent. For her audition she sang . The judges could not believe what they were hearing. Some were at a loss for words; others were te...[Content truncated]",

    "QA": {
        "Question": "What additional context about Angelina Jordan's early career could clarify the video's authenticity?",
        "Answer": "To clarify the authenticity of the video featuring Angelina Jordan, several aspects of her early career are noteworthy: 1. **Recognition from Norway's Got Talent**: Angelina Jordan gained significant fame at a young age by auditioning for Norway's Got Talent at just seven years old. This performance included her singing \"Gloomy Sunday\" in the style of Billie Holiday, which went viral and brought her considerable media attention. She ultimately won the competition at the age of eight, performing George Gershwin's \"Summertime\" [Query 1_evidence1]. 2. **Consistent Performance Style and Engagement**: The video transcript and description of the performance, which examine Jordan's emotional delivery of \"What a Difference a Day Makes,\" reflect her distinctive style developed from her early performances. This suggests that the authenticity of the video aligns with the characteristics of her performances during her rise to fame [Video_descriptor]. 3. **Age Verification**: It is clearly stated that Angelina Jordan was eight years old at the time the video was posted, coinciding with the timeline of her early public performances. This matches with the claim that the young girl in the video is indeed Angelina, further authenticating the video's content [Query 2_evidence1]. 4. **Cultural Background and Influences**: Angelina's diverse cultural heritage and early musical influences, including iconic artists like Whitney Houston, Billie Holiday, and Dinah Washington, contributed to her unique artistry, which is often reflected in her performances. Understanding her background adds depth to her artistic expression shown in the video [Query 2_evidence1].
