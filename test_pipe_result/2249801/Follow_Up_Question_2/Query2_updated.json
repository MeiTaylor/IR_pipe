Since then she has worked to raise money on behalf of environmental causes and various children's charities. She always performs barefoot, after befriending a young shoeless girl and giving her shoes to her. Jordan later wrote a book about the experience, Mellom to hjerter (Between Two Hearts).\n\nJordan has released multiple digital singles and EPs, and one full-length album called It's Magic. She appeared on the first season of Little Big Shots in 2016, and the second season of America's Got Talent: The Champions in 2020, where her cover version of Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" brought her much attention.\n\nJordan has lived in the United States since 2018. In August 2020, it was announced that she has signed with Republic Records.[2] Her first single under that label, \"Million Miles\", was released in November 2020.[3]\n\nAfter Jordan's performances of two Billie Holiday songs, \"Gloomy Sunday\" and \"I'm a Fool to Want You...[Content truncated]",

Whitney - and later Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington - became her first major musical influences.\nAt the age of seven, Angelina auditioned for Norway\u2019s Got Talent performing . She won the competition with the show drawing record TV audiences.\nNot surprisingly, throughout her rising career, Angelina has featured in prominent media outlets including TIME, CNN, BBC, and People while also performing on the U.S. network TV shows Little Big Shots and The View.\nIn 2016, Avicii chose Angelina for the vocals on his worldwide Volvo commercial campaign, a brilliant cover of Nina Simone\u2019s Feeling Good.\nAs well as singing before Nobel Peace Prize Laureates, charitable causes to which Angelina has given her talent include the Rainforest Alliance at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and Ein Herz f\u00fcr Kinder in Berlin where she helped raise over 21 Million Euros for children and families in need.\nThis multi-talented singing prodigy has also written a successful, illustrated children\u2019s book in her native Norway making Angelina the youngest published author in the country\u2019s history.\nBased on the true story of when she was six years old, Angelina met a homeless, shoeless girl. After they talked for a long time, she gave the girl her shoes and vowed never to appear on stage again wearing shoes until all the world\u2019s children had them. Since that time, Angelina has always performed barefoot in public.",
