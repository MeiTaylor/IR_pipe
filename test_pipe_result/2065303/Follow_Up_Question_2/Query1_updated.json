But when they do happen, they can be devastating. So, why do sharks attack people?\nThe crystal-clear water beneath 13-year-old Hannah Mighall darkened for a moment. She was sitting astride her surfboard, enjoying the warmth of the sun as she and her cousin waited for the next wave in Tasmania\u2019s idyllic Bay of Fires. Behind them the brilliant-white sandy beach was largely deserted and the surfing had been good so far.\nThe sudden shadow below made Mighall instinctively lift her feet \u2013 balls of kelp often broke off nearby rocks and drifted in the surf. \u201cThey are really slimy so I hated touching them,\u201d she says.\nBut then something took hold of her leg.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t hurt at first, it was like something gently grabbed hold of me and then I was in the water,\u201d says Mighall.\nTo those who witnessed what happened, however, it was anything but gentle. The water around Mighall exploded as a five-metre-long great white shark latched onto her right leg, lifted her off the surfboard and shook her in the air before disappearing underwater.\n\u201cIt took a few seconds for me to realise it was a shark,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I popped back up from the water I was lying on my back but my leg was in its mouth. All I could see was my black wetsuit leg, its teeth, pink gums, teeth and the dark bit under its nose where it meets white. I thought I was having a nightmare and kept trying to blink my eyes open.\u201d\nMighall\u2019s cousin, 33-year-old Syb Mundy, who had been sitting on his own board just a few metres from her, raced over and began punching the shark in the side of its head. The shark pulled away from him and as it went underwater it let go of Mighall, lunging instead for her surfboard that was still attached by a rope to her leg.\nYou might also be interested in:\n\u2022 The man who ran out of air\n\u2022\u00a0Could your swimwear attract sharks?\n\u2022\u00a0The secret nursery of hammerhead sharks\nWith the board in its mouth, the shark pulled Mighall underwater for a second time.

Great White sharks used to be a very rare occurrence to hear about let alone see a White shark on the Central coast. Yet about 10\u201315 years ago there was a bizarre yet significant migration of Elephant and Harbor seals into our local waters. The Elephant seals & Harbor seals population have increased immensely over the years now and they usually arrive during their molting and breeding season which usually starts at the end of Summer/beginning of fall. This particular year now, however, the Great white sharks have decided to come very early as well. There have been sightings up and down the coast since the end of June. Which doesn't stop the surfers from surfing in these shark infested waters. So there your answer to your question. We as surfers know full well the sharks are out there, in fact every where.

Many of these injuries stem from falls, in which I have \neither been slammed against my surfboard or the ocean bottom.

When you\u2019re underwater diving you\u2019re like one of those seals, and you can actually approach a great white underwater and touch it and it probably won\u2019t even consider attacking you.\n!\nNo that\u2019s not a fake image. That\u2019s Ocean Ramsey, a marine biologist who regularly free dives with great whites.\n!\nIt\u2019s an oddly safe thing to do, though I personally wouldn\u2019t do it. Super specialised ambush predators are quite particular with the conditions of their hunting exploits. You can also walk straight towards a lion or tiger, they visibly react like \u201ctf?\u201d and flee. If your eyes are on them that doesn\u2019t register to them as a predatory situation.  \nTurn your back on them, however-\n!\nSharks aren't particularly intelligent. Most \u201cattacks\u201d occur because sharks mistake the surfer for prey, they are splashing around on the surf where the shark expects them to be seals or lieing on a board which gives them a (very) roughly turtle like shape.\nUnderwater sharks treat divers as an equivalently sized shark. The last thing any predator wants is a confrontation that could end up with an injury. If they are more than 2/3 the size of the shark then the shark they will be actively avoiding them or at least treating them as potentially dangerous. For the most part this means being polite and nor invading each others space. If the diver inadvertently gets too close they will usually get a head thrash or tail swipe to tell them to mind their manners rather than a full on \u2018attack\u2019.\nEven when the shark is significantly larger than the diver it's rare they will cause a conflict, its not in the sharks interest to expend energy on a fight that it can avoid.",

This is my small - and I feel much-needed guide - for the people and surfers of Australia who are on the front line of shark interactions daily. You are in situations more dangerous than people like myself who base their work around diving with sharks ever are. You deserve to be flooded with information that may help you, also take responsibility to ensure that when you enter the ocean it is with the most educated approach towards its dangers. Sharks exist in our waters, and it\u2019s not only our job to co exist with them, it\u2019s our privilege, and I truly hope this document helps you do that. I hope this sheds some light on the seemingly endless darkness inspired by the Australian media towards the true risk of a shark attack. According to the Australian Shark Attack File run by the Taronga Zoo, in the last 50 years there have been 47 unprovoked shark attack fatalities. The Royal Life Saving Society notes a 10 year average of 292 deaths per year for people drowning in Australia. There were 176 diving related deaths in Australia between 2002-2009, an average of 23 per year. Fatalities from shark attacks over the last 50 years average just under one per year (0.9). \nINDEX: \nENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS \nAN ATTACK \nWHY DO SHARKS ATTACK HUMANS \nWHY SHARK NETS AND CULLS ARE NOT THE ANSWER \nSHARKS AND BLOOD \nSHARK AND YOU \nHAVE SHARK POPULATIONS BOOMED? \nSHARK MITIGATION DEVICES \nENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT INCREASE SHARK PRESENCE: \nBait balls Rainfall & River mouths Drop offs & deep water Water temperature Whale carcasses & other animal remains Time of day Moon phases \nINTRO Environmental factors that can affect a white shark\u2019s ability to successfully detect and approach its prey have been researched. Focusing on 8-year period at Seal Island, South Africa, attacks on seals and success rates were noted. Attacks and attempts varied with changes in depth, natural light, time of day, time of year, wind direction and other factors. I once heard someone say there are no dangerous sharks, just dangerous situations, and the same can be true for many animals.
