                "content": "Shark attacks are still relatively rare occurrences even though humans should be easy prey compared to fast-moving fish and seals. But when they do happen, they can be devastating. So, why do sharks attack people?\nThe crystal-clear water beneath 13-year-old Hannah Mighall darkened for a moment. She was sitting astride her surfboard, enjoying the warmth of the sun as she and her cousin waited for the next wave in Tasmania’s idyllic Bay of Fires. Behind them the brilliant-white sandy beach was largely deserted and the surfing had been good so far.\nThe sudden shadow below made Mighall instinctively lift her feet – balls of kelp often broke off nearby rocks and drifted in the surf. “They are really slimy so I hated touching them,” she says.\nBut then something took hold of her leg.\n“It didn’t hurt at first, it was like something gently grabbed hold of me and then I was in the water,” says Mighall.\nTo those who witnessed what happened, however, it was anything but gentle. The water around Mighall exploded as a five-metre-long great white shark latched onto her right leg, lifted her off the surfboard and shook her in the air before disappearing underwater.\n“It took a few seconds for me to realise it was a shark,” she says. “When I popped back up from the water I was lying on my back but my leg was in its mouth. All I could see was my black wetsuit leg, its teeth, pink gums, teeth and the dark bit under its nose where it meets white. I thought I was having a nightmare and kept trying to blink my eyes open.”\nMighall’s cousin, 33-year-old Syb Mundy, who had been sitting on his own board just a few metres from her, raced over and began punching the shark in the side of its head. The shark pulled away from him and as it went underwater it let go of Mighall, lunging instead for her surfboard that was still attached by a rope to her leg.\nYou might also be interested in:\n• The man who ran out of air\n• Could your swimwear attract sharks?\n• The secret nursery of hammerhead sharks\nWith the board in its mouth, the shark pulled Mighall underwater for a second time.

In the marine environment, this issue is exemplified by shark-human interactions. The annual shark bite incidence rate (SBIR) in La Réunion (Indian Ocean) is among the highest in the world (up to 1 event per 24,000 hours of surfing) and has experienced a 23-fold increase over the 2005–2016 period. Since 1988, 86% of shark bite events on surfers involved ocean-users off the leeward coast, where 96% of surfing activities took place. We modeled the SBIR as a function of environmental variables, including benthic substrate, sea temperature and period of day. The SBIR peaked in winter, during the afternoon and dramatically increased on coral substrate since the mid-2000s. Seasonal patterns of increasing SBIR followed similar fluctuations of large coastal shark occurrences (particularly the bull shark Carcharhinus leucas), consistent with the hypothesis that higher shark presence may result in an increasing likelihood of shark bite events. Potential contributing factors and adaptation of ocean-users to the increasing shark bite hazard are discussed. This interdisciplinary research contributes to a better understanding of shark-human interactions. The modeling method is relevant for wildlife hazard management in general.\nHuman–wildlife conflicts...[Content truncated]",

In the marine environment, this issue is exemplified by shark-human interactions. The annual shark bite incidence rate (SBIR) in La Réunion (Indian Ocean) is among the highest in the world (up to 1 event per 24,000 hours of surfing) and has experienced a 23-fold increase over the 2005–2016 period. Since 1988, 86% of shark bite events on surfers involved ocean-users off the leeward coast, where 96% of surfing activities took place. We modeled the SBIR as a function of environmental variables, including benthic substrate, sea temperature and period of day. The SBIR peaked in winter, during the afternoon and dramatically increased on coral substrate since the mid-2000s. Seasonal patterns of increasing SBIR followed similar fluctuations of large coastal shark occurrences (particularly the bull shark Carcharhinus leucas), consistent with the hypothesis that higher shark presence may result in an increasing likelihood of shark bite events. Potential contributing factors and adaptation of ocean-users to the increasing shark bite hazard are discussed. This interdisciplinary research contributes to a better understanding of shark-human interactions. The modeling method is relevant for wildlife hazard management in general.\nHuman–wildlife conflicts...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What alternative explanations exist for the presence of a shark alongside surfers in the video?",
        "Answer": "There are several alternative explanations for the presence of a shark alongside surfers in the video:\n\n1. **Natural Shark Behavior**: Sharks, including great whites, often inhabit waters near popular surfing areas due to the availability of prey. It is not uncommon for sharks to be present in regions frequented by surfers, as they may be attracted to schools of fish or other marine life, rather than being directly interested in surfers themselves. This phenomenon suggests that the presence of sharks near surfers may be a result of natural predatory behaviors rather than targeted interactions with humans.\n\n2. **Increased Shark Populations and Sightings**: Research indicates that shark populations may be increasing in certain areas, leading to more frequent sightings of these creatures. For example, data has shown that specific regions experience higher rates of shark attacks correlating with the abundance of sharks in those waters, which may result in more surfers encountering sharks as sharks expand their range without necessarily targeting surfers specifically.\n\n3. **Misinterpretation of Shark Behavior**: Often, the mere sighting of a shark, such as a dorsal fin, can be sensationalized in media. In many instances, these creatures are simply swimming by and not exhibiting aggressive behavior. Understanding that shark-human interactions are often overstated can clarify the nature of these occurrences: sharks do not always pose a threat to surfers and may be largely indifferent to their presence.\n\n4. **Changes in Human Activity**: As more people engage in water sports like surfing, the number of encounters between humans and sharks naturally increases. This is supported by the idea that as the number of surfers rises, the likelihood of an encounter increases, not necessarily indicating an increase in shark aggression or intent.\n\nBased on the analysis of the evidence and the reasoning process, I would evaluate my confidence in this explanation to be **90%**. This evaluation is based on the consistencies found across various studies regarding shark behavior and interactions with humans, emphasizing the need to contextualize such encounters rather than interpret them as direct threats or intentional actions by the sharks.",
