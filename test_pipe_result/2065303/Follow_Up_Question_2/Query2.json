And regarding the now standard rationalization provided by various shark researchers and well-meaning ocean conservation advocates that the increased number of these interactions proves that California has always been teeming with white sharks and these “rare” and sometimes fatal instances of mistaken identity are simply the result of there being more surfers, not more white sharks, has me wanting to respond with complete conviction: “Bullsh-t!” \nBefore howling in outrage, follow me here, my hypothesis beginning with a personal, and very pertinent, anecdote. \nIt was an irrational fear, we knew, but a dread fear nevertheless; this was 1977, after all, and the release of Steven Spielberg’s blockbuster movie Jaws two years previous was still fresh in everybody’s minds. We thought about great white sharks a lot while surfing along California’s Central Coast, ranging from Pismo Beach up through Big Sur, especially at spots deemed, for various reasons, to be “sharky.”\n Funny thing, though, was that up to this point none of us had ever seen a great white shark, nor knew anyone who had. Our trepidation was fueled purely by the imagination, the peril existing only in the abstract. Until that one day in Cayucos. We were surfing a spot called Toro Creek, me and friends Jeff Chamberlain and Rick Black, settling into a fun, three-to four-foot beachbreak session.

Perhaps Craig’s intentions were to approach someone whom he knows is working on shark conservation at the moment to provide a voice on the subject. Or maybe he intended for me to make some sort of connection to shark-human interactions since I spend a lot of my time thinking about this in my work. Or maybe his intention was for me to employ my trademark wise-assery and irreverent commentary on all the bloviating that’s been done since the event.Here’s the thing about intention… How do we know for sure what anyone (let alone a shark) intends?\nThus far I’ve seen narratives surrounding the Fanning event fall into two distinct themes, hinging on whether or not you wish to call this event a “.” Within the shark attack camp, I’m seeing lots of “”,” or “_,_” story lines. Taking this to the absurd and crackpot level, the always reliable Fox News has even begun to make calls that maybe it’s time to “_._”\nOn the other end of the spectrum are those who perhaps justifiably feel that the words “_shark attack_,” are prejudicial and loaded (in other words weighted towards an interpretation where the shark has targeted a human with the intent of harm (the consumption of the human being one possible outcome). This language revision camp has been employing a lot of their own “” that suggest the “,” or the shark was just “.” To this reader, a lot of this smacks of apologetics...[Content truncated]",

In the marine environment, this issue is exemplified by shark-human interactions. The annual shark bite incidence rate (SBIR) in La Réunion (Indian Ocean) is among the highest in the world (up to 1 event per 24,000 hours of surfing) and has experienced a 23-fold increase over the 2005–2016 period. Since 1988, 86% of shark bite events on surfers involved ocean-users off the leeward coast, where 96% of surfing activities took place. We modeled the SBIR as a function of environmental variables, including benthic substrate, sea temperature and period of day. The SBIR peaked in winter, during the afternoon and dramatically increased on coral substrate since the mid-2000s. Seasonal patterns of increasing SBIR followed similar fluctuations of large coastal shark occurrences (particularly the bull shark Carcharhinus leucas), consistent with the hypothesis that higher shark p",

In the marine environment, this issue is exemplified by shark-human interactions. The annual shark bite incidence rate (SBIR) in La Réunion (Indian Ocean) is among the highest in the world (up to 1 event per 24,000 hours of surfing) and has experienced a 23-fold increase over the 2005–2016 period. Since 1988, 86% of shark bite events on surfers involved ocean-users off the leeward coast, where 96% of surfing activities took place. We modeled the SBIR as a function of environmental variables, including benthic substrate, sea temperature and period of day. The SBIR peaked in winter, during the afternoon and dramatically increased on coral substrate since the mid-2000s. Seasonal patterns of increasing SBIR followed similar fluctuations of large coastal shark occurrences (particularly the bull shark Carcharhinus leucas), consistent with the hypothesis that higher shark presence may result in an increasing likelihood of shark bite events. Potential contributing factors and adaptation of ocean-users to the increasing shark bite hazard are discussed. This interdisciplinary research contributes to a better understanding of shark-human interactions. The modeling method is relevant for wildlife hazard management in general.\nHuman–wildlife conflicts...[Content truncated]",

The MIH is appealing because: (i) it is simple to understand and therefore intellectually satisfying, especially for the general public, and (ii) it exonerates the shark from intentional responsibility for shark bites on humans by characterizing such bites as tragic ‘accidents’.

Typically, tabloids are considered to provide more sensational coverage than broadsheets. We investigated how sharks and shark–human interactions were portrayed in four major Australian newspapers during a period of a record number of shark attacks in Australian waters. There was strong focus on human risk from sharks, and over-reportage of negative aspects. Thirty incidents were recorded: two fatal, 20 injury, and eight ‘near-miss’. Of 309 ‘shark’ articles surveyed, 24% mentioned fatalities (65% occurred prior to the study, some decades earlier). Injury was reported in 40% of articles, and ‘near-miss’ in 33% (89% related to an incident in South Africa involving an Australian surfing celebrity). The tabloid, Telegraph, published substantially more shark-related articles and photographs than other newspapers. There was otherwise no consi",

Overall, the other three article formats (Front Page Banner Headline, Front Page Article, Special Feature Article), were infrequently used (10.7% combined). There was no significant difference in their proportional use, either between genres or among titles.\nAnalysis of mean word count in Run Of Paper articles (excluding two extreme outlier articles; Australian, 2918, Mail, 2693), revealed a wide variation among titles (range: 38 \\–1554 \\). The mean word count overall in the two broadsheets was highly significantly different compared with the combined word counts/article in the tabloids (t127.37 = 4.17, p < 0.001). There was also a highly significant difference in mean word count among titles overall (Welch: F3,103.38 = 7.718, p < 0.001; Brown–Forsythe: F3,143.85 = 7.470, p < 0.001). In addition, there was a highly significant difference in the mean word count among newspapers (Australian > Mail (p < 0.001); Australian > Telegraph (p = 0.015); Herald > Mail (p < 0.001); Herald > Telegraph (p = 0.042), but not between titles of the same genre ().\n#### 3.4. Use of Photographs and Graphics\nA substantial majority of articles featured at least one photograph, both overall (69.9%), and among titles (range: \\ 63.0%–\\ 75.4%; ).\nThree photograph categories (human, shark, object/scenery) were identified. These occurred in the same descending rank order frequency overall, and among all four titles: human > shark > object/scenery.\nWithin the ‘human’ category, seven subjects were portrayed: near-miss > injury > public > friend/relative (of near-miss/injury/fatality) > public office holder (including politicians and other elected officials) > scientist > fatality (). The ‘human’ photograph category was most frequently presented (overall 69.9% n = 151; range, \\ 69.0%, n = 20; \\ 70.3%, n = 71). ‘Near-miss’ was the most-featured subject within the ‘human’ category (36.4%, n = 55), and among all photographs overall (25.5%). Within the ‘near-miss’ subject, an Australian professional surfer, Mick Fanning, who experienced an incident with a (unconfirmed) white shark, recorded live while competing in a round of the World Surfing Championship in South Africa, was substantially the most-frequent specific subject, overall,...[Content truncated]",

Under current labels, listings of shark attack may even include instances where there is no physical contact between shark and human. The dominant perception of intent-laden shark “attacks” with fatal outcomes is outdated as a generic term and misleading to the public. We propose new descriptive labels based on the different outcomes associated with human–shark interactions, including sightings, encounters, bites, and the rare cases of fatal bites. We argue two central points: first, that a review of the scientific literature shows that humans are “not on the menu” as typical shark prey. Second, we argue that the adoption of a more prescriptive code of reporting by scientists, the media, and policy makers will serve the public interest by clarifying the true risk posed by sharks and informing better policy making. Finally, we apply these new categories to the 2009 New South Wales Shark Meshing Report in Australia and the history of shark incidents in Florida to illustrate how these changes in terminology can alter the narratives of human–shark interactions.\nAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.\nScience plays a powerful role in describing and labeling the natural world, providing social meaning for phenomena in nature. New scientific names and explanations shape our understanding as scientific discoveries replace old myths and mysteries. An example of this process is our evolving knowledge about sharks and shark bites on people. For centuries, the question “Why do sharks bite?” has implicitly also asked “What do shark bites mean?” The answers to these questions have implications for the way scientific discourse informs the public and policy makers. The subject of shark bites illustrates how vivid terms like “attack” are difficult to replace and...[Content truncated]",
