It’s a sentiment that most people can understand. Dale Pearson, who runs a California winery called , has been in and around the ocean for nearly 40 years. This, though, caught him off guard–as a huge massive white stuck in the shallows would do. And while it’s probably not the best idea to wade out to a distressed shark and see how close you can get (it’s actually a terrible idea), the video is incredible.\nAccording to Dale, after the very unfortunate stingray hit at the end of the video (shuffle, man, shuffle!), the shark managed to find its way to deeper water, where it was seen swimming around for a few days after.\n* * *\n!\n(c) Towsurfer.com 2017\n### More From Towsurfer\n*   ]\n*   ]\n*   ]\n*   ]\n*   ]\n*   ]\n### _Related_\n### Comments\nPost navigation\n---------------\nLatest News\n-----------\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \nArchive\n-------\nJune 2017\n| M | T | W | T | F | S | S |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   |  |  | 3 |  |\n| 5 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  | 17 | 18 |\n|  |  |  |  | 23...[Content truncated]",

A man on a surfboard is apparently towed by a Great White Shark\nPhotographer Kem McNair claims he captured the hair-raising moment on home video from the shore at Florida's New Smyrna beach.\nHe said the stunt - dubbed 'shark-riding' - has become the latest, and most dangerous, extreme sports craze in more than a decade.\nIn his video, a 25-year-old male surfer is filmed being dragged along by a fishing line after baiting a shark with chunks of bloodied steak.\nClutching a fishing rod with meat on the hook, the clip begins with the surfer jumping off a pier into the sea. He casts his bait into the water and watches as a 4ft dorsal fin appears on the horizon and heads straight for the line.\nAfter chomping on the bait the shark swims off with the surfer being dragged behind on his board, clutching the fishing line with both hands like a water-skier.\nHe reaches speeds of approximately 30mph as he races past stunned onlookers enjoying a dip in the sea.\n!The daredevil - or hoaxer - prepares to jump into the sea with his surfboard and some chunks of bloodied meat to attract a shark\nAfter 30 seconds the...[Content truncated]",

Generally we only talk about sharks after someone has been seriously attacked, or worse.\nEast coast surfers have lived with a new shark reality for nearly a decade now. Since that notorious run of attacks began between Byron and Ballina in 2015, there have been six fatal great white attacks along this coast. All but one — 18 months ago, when ocean swimmer Simon Nellist was killed by a great white in Sydney’s Little Bay — were on surfers.\nSince then, we’ve had a fortunate reprieve from this kind of news.\nBut that all changed three weeks ago, on August 26, when Toby Begg was attacked by what’s believed to have been a four-metre great white while surfing at Port Macquarie’s Lighthouse Beach. Toby is still recovering in hospital.\n!\nScene of the latest attack, on Toby Begg in late August. Lighthouse Beach houses two of 15 SMART drumlines in the Port council area. Nobody knows if the shark responsible was tagged.\n**The conversation in the wake of shark attacks** these days feels more informed and reasoned than a decade ago. Maybe not in the wider media, but certainly within surf communities up and down the coast. Ideology has been replaced by pragmatism, at least in part.\nBut it’s still a big conversation — one triggered again by what happened at Lighthouse Beach, and of all things, by a government...[Content truncated]",

(KGO) -- Mavericks surfers got a major dose of adrenaline Sunday, but for once it had nothing to do with surfing huge waves.\nInstead it came from a close encounter with a humongous great white shark, estimated to be 18 to 20 feet long, that cruised within inches of one jet ski and forced the evacuation of the entire surf break.\n\"This was by far the biggest and scariest creature I've ever seen in the ocean.\"\nAnd Drake Stanley would know.\nA big wave surfer and professional surf rescuer, Stanley has been the ocean his entire life, diving and spear-fishing.\n**RELATED: **\nBut he said what he saw Sunday was like nothing he had ever seen before.\nIt started as just another day out at Mavericks.\nStanley said he had surfed in the morning and was working as a jet ski rescuer for other surfers in the afternoon.\nHe told ABC7 News that he was sitting on his jet ski with the engine turned off around 1:30PM by and area known as Mushroom Rock when he first saw the huge shark.\n\"It looked like a whale,\" explained Stanley as he watched it rise out of the green depths of the ocean.\nStanley said the shark swam just inches under his jet ski, close enough for him to see the scratch marks on its skin and its dark gray eye.\n\"I could have reached out and touched it,\" Stanley recalled.\n**RELATED: **\nHe estimated the shark to be about 16 to 20 feet long since it was much longer than his jet ski and rescue board.\nIt was so big, that it didn't even fit into the frame for the one picture he was able to take of it.\nBut the frightening encounter got scarier when Stanley said the shark spotted a surfer paddling in from the Mavericks break.\n\"It saw the surfer and just made a beeline for him... I thought, 'I'm going to watch a shark attack.'\"\nRealizing that the surfer had no idea the shark was out there, Stanley turned on his jet ski and revved it loudly several times in an attempt to draw the shark's attention away.\n**RELATED: **\nIt worked and Stanley was able to scoop up the surfer on his jet ski but the shark then started heading for the waiting lineup of surf...[Content truncated]",

Ouch.\nBut none other than one of our most widely whispered topics, SHARKS, are more associated with the risks of being a surfer.  Royce Fraley, a long-time surfer based in Occidental, California, is incredibly aware of this risk and has encountered our infamous grey suited landlord not once, but **twice** in the chilly Northern California waters.\n“In both situations, it’s amazing how your brain kicks into a ‘fight or flight mode’ real quick,” said Fraley. “You automatically want to believe it’s not happening to you, but it is. All these thoughts happen within milliseconds.”\nLike jelly to peanut butter, sharks and surfers go hand-in-hand by reputation, sans, well, let’s hope tastiness. In fact, based on my personal conversations, one of the most cited reasons why folks decide to not surf is because of our association with our oceanic toothy counterpart.\nBut consider statistics—for the average surfer who is in the water maybe not every day, but most days and is floating in the ocean for an extended period of time, what is the actual risk?\n“No one plans to paddle out and hit a rock,” said Sean van Sommeron, Founder and Director of the  in Santa Cruz, California. “Of course, every time you paddle out, you’re taking a risk....[Content truncated]",

We decided that if it went onto the point it would be un-surfable for months,\" he said.\n\"That had happened before with sinew that had decayed and wrapped around the Point.\"\nMr Treloar said they decided to tow the carcass themselves because authorities have previously failed to remove whales which had washed up on local beaches.\n\"They don't seem to want to know anything about it. There's one on the back beach already. They never came and moved that one,\" he said.\nA spokesman for the Office of Environment and Heritage said it was illegal for the public to touch a dead whale.\n\"Whale carcasses remain protected. People are advised not to touch dead or rotting carcasses,\" the spokesman said.\nMr Treloar said he, Mr Towner and two other friends used a small boat to drag the whale away from beachgoers.\n\"We chucked the sand anchor around the flutes of the tail because no-one was going to jump in and put a rope around the tail,\" he said.\n\"We only moved it 50 metres because it was a 16-foot boat with a 30-horsepower \\ trying to move a five-tonne whale, but we actually moved it past the Point.\"\nMr Towner...[Content truncated]",
