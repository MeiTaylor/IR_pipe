However, providing good quality CPR is a skill, and it is highly advisable for everyone to attend a Basic Life Support course to learn it.\nThese can often be done through your employers or local providers. Watching the attached YouTube tutorial is a good start. The key things to remember in this situation are: start with five rescue breaths, followed by chest compressions and rescue breaths at a ratio of 30 compressions to two breaths, chest compressions should be performed with both hands over the sternum (between the nipples) at a rate of around 100 beats per minute, to a depth of around 6cm in adults, for effective rescue breaths the nose should be pinched and a tight seal made around the mouth, watching the chest for rising when the breath is administered.\nIf possible always try and rotate CPR providers every two minutes to prevent fatigue and ensure good quality compressions. If an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is available (for example lifeguard station or beachfront hotel) this should be used. Once CPR is started it should not be stopped until the patient recovers signs of life or the paramedics take over.\nThe above information is intended as basic advice for the layperson with no first aid experience. I highly recommend that every surfer should attend a Basic Life Support course which will provide invaluable practical experience.\nWhile the utmost care has been taken to ensure that all the advice presented is accurate and up to date, guidelines may vary from country to country. For the purposes of this article I have used the most recent UK Resuscitation Council guidelines (2015), the most recent American Heart Association \u2018Cardiac arrest in special situations\u2019 guidelines (2010) and the Oxford handbook of expedition and wilderness medicine, 2nd Edition (2015)\n_Cover shot: Eli Olsen providing manual in-line stabalisation of the spine during a rescue by _\n* * *\n!\n(c) Towsurfer.com 2017\n### Comments",

Haraguchi then kicks the shark away.\nMedics were called to the beach and rushed Maggie to Cape May Regional Medical Center for treatment that included six stitches. Wildlife officials are unsure of the size or species that may have attacked her.\n\"I'm just in shock. I just thought that wouldn't be something that would ever happen to me because I watched all the Jaws movies and stuff, and I thought it was a joke,\" Maggie said.\nSTAY SHARK SMART: WHAT TO KNOW WHEN YOU HEAD INTO THE WATER\nA group of people on a fishing charter off Whitianga, New Zealand, were startled and stunned when a large mako shark leaped out of the water and landed on the front of the boat.\nData from the University of Florida shows that shark attacks worldwide are infrequent, and deadly attacks are even more rare. Of the 41 unprovoked shark attacks recorded last year, only one resulted in a fatality.\nThe last unprovoked shark attack in New Jersey was off the coast of Ventnor in 2017.\n\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or\n        redistributed. \u00a92024 FOX News Network, LLC.

I left the job at 9 am went to Ocean Beach and as I pulled up, Doc, Tom Powers, and Dave Schmidt were checking the surf at Sloat. The walls were endless with nowhere to get out. Easy 25-30ft faces. Doc is telling us that we could probably get out down at the north end of the beach. Yeah sure, and I can levitate a car if I think hard enough! I told them about a place that would take all the swell that we were looking at and turn it into a perfect peak and Doc wanted nothing to do with the idea. Dave, Tom and I left for Mavericks. We parked in the lot and walked to the top of the cliff on the north side of the point. Dave said, \u201cIs that it, is that it?\u201d pointing to different waves that were present. I said look out around the point. He stared at a 20\u2019 wave unload on the reef and started pacing. He said, \u201cOh my God it\u2019s Waimea 2.\u201d We went back to the car to change. Does anyone surf here, he asked, \u201cI do\u201d.\n#### We got to the end of the trail and checked again, mavericks was going off in a big way. I told them I was paddling out the north side. They wanted nothing to do with that so they paddled around the south. I had never done that, so I said: \u201cI will see you guys at the peak\u201d.

My hope was that if somebody was drowning I could help them or if it was trash I could just pull it out of the water,\u201d Frimmer explained.\nFrimmer says she grabbed the board and started pulling it to shore.\n\u201cI paddled and I pulled until I could put my feet down and then I was able to pull the board closer to me and I saw his feet and flippers and began to pull him in, thinking I might do CPR on top of my board but it was clear that it was way too late once I saw the extent of his injuries and he had already passed,\u201d Frimmer said.\nShe says she flagged down the first people she saw to call 911.\nThe water was closed for 24 hours to all surfers and swimmers but the harbor director says the signs to enter the water at your own risk will remain through the weekend.\n\u201cJust out of an abundance of caution,\u201d said Eric Endersby, Morro...[Content truncated]",

I was 15 and had just finished my first day back at school after the winter break. The reef is famous among surfers for its powerful waves and popularity with sharks. If you see lots of birds diving into the reef or notice a strong fishy smell in the air, you should not surf there.\nBut on that day in July 2000, the waves were perfect, just over head high, and there was no wind. The water was warm for winter, too. The conditions were too good to resist.\nThe session started off well, but about an hour and a half in, my brother and some of my friends got out of the water because they felt uneasy; there was the faintest whiff of sardines, which can attract sharks.
