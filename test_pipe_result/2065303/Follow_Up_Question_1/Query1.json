As they grow and mature, the sharks move to other areas and colder water, where seals and sea lions are more abundant.\n### \nWhite sharks are widely distributed around the world, mostly in cold, temperate waters, only occasionally occurring in tropical seas. They prefer areas with sea surface temperatures of 50 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit. White sharks are commonly seen at the ocean surface but have been known to occur as deep as 6,150 ft. Juvenile white sharks are frequently seen in shallow nearshore waters off Southern California, especially in the summer and during warm water periods.\n### \nWhite sharks play a crucial role in the marine ecosystem by feeding on pinniped (seal and sea lion) populations. The only real threats white sharks face are from humans and the occasional killer whale (or orca, _Orcinus orca_).\nAccording to Burr Heneman, who drafted California's white shark protection legislation, \"white sharks, orcas, and disease are about the only factors limiting seal and sea lion populations in California, and research increasingly confirms that the white shark population is pretty small and highly vulnerable to fishing pressure.\"\n### \nIn 2014, the Fish and Game Commission determined that based on the best available science, listing the northeastern Pacific population of white shark as threatened or endangered under the California Endangered Species Act was not warranted. This was consistent with CDFW's recommendation. There are currently multiple estimates of the northeastern Pacific white shark population ranging from just a few hundred to greater than 3,000 individuals. All current estimates involve some degree of uncertainty, as there are significant gaps in understanding of white shark movements, reproductive biology and mating behaviors. Based on a thorough review of the best available scientific information, the higher estimates are more likely correct.\nData on commercial fisheries interactions provide a useful tool for studying trends in white shark populations, which are difficult to study directly due to their wide range and low density. Catch trends over the past decade suggest the juvenile white shark population in Southern California may be increasing. This is further supported by a rise in the incidental catch of white sharks in gillnet fisheries even as effort in these fisheries has declined. The apparent population increase may be due to added regulatory protections, primarily enacted in the 1990s, including state and federal prohibitions on take of white shark, and progressively restrictive regulations on gillnet gear over the same time period.\nThere are also indications that the adult population of white sharks may be increasing. White shark attacks on marine mammals at Southeast Farallon Island have been documented...[Content truncated]",

Unfortunately, contemporary narratives widely presented in popular mainstream media have attached an utterly negative connotation to sharks, propagating an unsubstantiated and fabricated image of them as implacable and voracious predators. Recently a lot of attention is devoted to understanding the public perception towards sharks in order to promote their conservation given that a quarter of all shark species are facing extinction. This work assessed the current attitude of the public towards sharks on a global scale, utilizing modern technology through a single protocol that explored the importance of factors like culture, history, or educational level in shaping attitudes. We collected 13,800 questionnaires from 137 countries, with 25 countries presenting more than 100 answers each, representing in total 92% of the filled questionnaires. A generally positive attitude towards sharks emerged from our study, influenced significantly by several factors including knowledge and participation in marine conservation projects. Interestingly, shark attacks emerged as an important factor, with countries having high numbers of shark attacks exhibiting a highly positive attitude towards sharks, potentially because their citizens are more aware of the issue and the importance of sharks for the . Guidelines for shifting public attitude towards sharks and consequently advancing shark conservation were also drawn.\nIntroduction\n------------\nSharks are among the oldest animals still surviving on the planet, showing high diversity and complex social structures \\ and representing irreplaceable elements of the integrity and the functionality of the marine communities \\, \\. Sharks' biological characteristics, slow growth, late maturity, and low fecundity make them extremely susceptible to overexploitation \\. Globally, sharks are facing an unprecedented population decline, primarily due to intensification of fisheries \\, with about 100 million sharks being killed every year \\. This is driven primarily by the demand for shark fins in Asia \\, while at the same time shark meat contributes significantly to the food security of several developing nations without being in most cases a targeted species \\.\nRecently, several researchers put effort into understanding the attitudes of different factors involved, directly or indirectly, in shark protection and shark fisheries for advancing their conservation (e.g. \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\. Among other impacts, public opinion plays a significant role in shaping environmental policies \\ and is a key factor for achieving environmental “gains” \\. Human attitudes towards wildlife, not only influence the coexistence between humans and animals \\ but is also an issue of high importance in terms of conservation \\. Particularly when animal-human interactions result in conflicts, research on public attitudes is a prerequisite to developing effective strategies for the protection of wildlife species \\.\nSharks are considered one of the twenty most charismatic animals \\, however contemporary narratives still often attach them an utterly negative connotation, propagating an unsubstantiated and fabricated image of them as implacable and voracious predators \\, \\. This culture-driven negative image, which vilified sharks in the public, is currently one of the most significant issues for their conservation \\, \\. Interestingly, this perception of sharks is gradually changing \\. Surveys through questionnaires evidenced the rise of a positive shift, despite the fear still elicited by them (Australia: \\; Brazil: \\; Ecuador: \\; Mozambique: \\; UK: \\; USA: \\). This change in perception is also associated with a change in the use, from extractive to non-extractive, linked to the increase of interest in ecotourism and direct contact with these animals \\.\nThe present study aimed at assessing the current attitudes of the public towards sharks on a global scale, utilizing modern technology, with a survey that was administered online. The novelty of this work lies in the use of a single protocol that allows the exploration of how crossing social/demographic categories, and other drivers, like educational level and experiences, affect attitudes specifically for sharks. We further draw guidelines that will assist in future conservation efforts and primarily campaigning in different countries.\nSection snippets\n----------------\nSurvey design\n-------------\nA questionnaire-based survey was developed (Table A1), utilizing the attitudinal scale of Kellert \\ for assessing the attitudes of the respondents towards sharks. The questionnaire consisted of 4 parts facilitating the quantification of the results and the investigation of the relations between different factors and the attitudes.\nThe...[Content truncated]",

One of the most popular topics on the biomaterial-based tissue regeneration process may be the interaction between cells and scaffolds. An increasing number of studies have identified the variables affecting cell–scaffold interaction. The creation and investigation of new scaffolds for TE and regenerative medicine based on specific interactions have become possible owing to these findings. This review discusses the effects of various types of scaffold materials on cells in TE. Because the intrinsic properties of scaffolds are essential, the influence of the physical, chemical, mechanical, and biological characteristics of scaffold materials on cell–scaffold interaction that has been discovered in recent research is elaborated in this review. The components carried by scaffolds, the degradation process, and the role of degraded products in cell–scaffold interactions are examined. Further, the roles of cells, including cell types, functions, and adhesion mechanisms, and extracellular matrix are discussed. Finally, the latest research progress on cell–scaffold interactions among various engineered tissues or organs in the oral and craniofacial region is summarized. A deeper understanding of cell–scaffold interactions is anticipated to benefit the development of TE and regenerative medicine.\n\nThe oral and craniofacial region, an integral part of the human body, performs functions, such as mastication and aesthetics. Numerous materials (including bioinert or bioactive materials) have been used to restore missing oral and craniofacial tissues. For example, recent archaeological findings indicated that dental implants were found among Mayans in the 2nd century AD [1]. From the perspective of regenerative medicine, the substitutes provided by these conventional techniques do not regenerate tissues capable of fully performing their original functions. In recent decades, tissue engineering (TE) has been introduced and widely investigated as an innovative alternative to conventional biomaterials for reconstructing the tissues and organs in the oral and craniofacial region, as shown in Fig. 1 [2]. It is a multidisciplinary science that applies biological and engineering principles to investigate and develop biological substitutes for restoring, maintaining, improving, and replacing tissues [3].

Scientists are arguing, however, that the public opinion of sharks is increasingly positive, and that opposition to lethal shark control and to negative shark framing is growing. Positive attitudes and behaviour towards sharks tend to be influenced by an array of factors, which ought to be considered in studies aimed at effectively steering shark conservation actions. This study used a questionnaire survey of 1138 beach visitors in , together with , to investigate human perceptions of sharks, and their influence on outcome variables including attitudes and behaviour towards shark hazard mitigation and shark framing. The results show that basic knowledge and attitudes towards sharks have a significant effect on the outcome variables. Additionally, attitudes towards sharks moderate the effect of perceived risk from sharks on the outcome variables. The results support arguments of public concern for sharks, and provide guidance for strategies aimed at garnering more support for shark conservation.\nIntroduction\n------------\n...[Content truncated]",

It is based on a hexagonal pattern that originated in bush crickets, tree and torrent frogs, and mushroom-tongued salamanders, as shown in Figure 2a–d. The hexagonal surface pattern was recognized as a friction-oriented characteristic capable of decreasing stick-slip and hydroplaning while enabling friction adjustment [86]. Besides these hexagonal structures, bioinspired bio-materials also paved the way for developing low-friction surfaces [87,88]. Dopamine is among the category of green oil-soluble additives, providing low-friction have been discussed in detail in the work-study. \n(a) On a tree trunk, a rusted tree frog.

Copyright Permission 2014, Royal Society.\nModern bio-inspired functional materials can be designed for solid particle erosion resistance. For instance, the body coverings of the scorpion and tamarisk, which have a unique surface structure that is present everywhere, can withstand sand erosion very well [90]. By altering solid particle erosion parameters, such structure can increase the resistance of naturally created surfaces against solid particle erosion [91]. The cuticle of a lobster and the nacre of a shell have unique interior structures. Because the unique interior structure can increase the fracture toughness of the natural materials, the nacre is employed for safeguarding internal soft tissue and the cuticle [92]. The two-layer structure, which includes a hard layer and a soft layer, has a buffering effect, which helps the skin of desert lizards and sandfish endure wind-blown sand quite effectively [78,93]. The internal vascular system of the skin or bone can provide healing agents to injury sites for self-healing to repair the damage and mitigate further damage [94]. Therefore, precise and accurate solutions to solid particle erosion could be developed by mimicking natural materials with these unique architectures. Furthermore, surface texturing was also considered a beneficial aspect of strengthening the surface properties of the bioinspired surfaces [54,95,96,97,98]. \nSurface textures like dimples, grooves, or convex on surfaces of friction units using mechanical or chemical processing technologies, have gained popularity as a means to enhance the tribological performance of mechanics [99].

Often, the seals hear me anchor up and set up behind my boat. If I manage to hook a fish, a seal takes it right off my line. It gets worse every year as their population increases and their range expands.”\nMike “Boz” Bosley has fished the waters around the Cape for 40 years. For the last 10, he’s been out there every day since he started Dragonfly Sportfishing in Orleans. “The loudest complaints I hear about seals come from shore-based striper fishermen. I do see a big difference in the abundance of bass in their traditional habitats, like the shallower waters on the flats early in June on Cape Cod Bay and down on Monomoy all summer long. The fish don’t come in close anymore. The seals...[Content truncated]",

(1922). A scale of grade and class terms for clastic sediments. :377-392.\nUnderstanding the distribution of sand grain sizes on a beach can help in understanding the oceanographic processes that shape the coastline in a particular area. For example, high-energy waves, which have longer wavelengths, generally produce beach surfaces with a relatively similar, or homogenous, grain size distribution. Lower energy waves, which have smaller wavelengths, tend to produce beach surfaces with a more mixed, or heterogeneous, grain size distribution. Most of the time, beaches exposed to high-energy waves have larger sediments than those that are exposed to lower-energy waves.\nFactors other than wave energy also determine sand grain size at a beach. The size of sand grains is related to the slope of the beach. For example, the steeper the beach, the larger the sand grain size tends to be. This is because larger particles can be cast higher up the beach by the waves on steep beaches. On flatter beaches, however, sand grains tend to be rolled back and forth and broken into smaller pieces.\nOn some beaches, sand grain size composition varies with distance from the water. A greater proportion of finer, smaller sand grains may be pushed higher up the beach by waves or by wind, whereas larger, coarser grains are deposited closer to the water. However, beaches are complex and highly variable environments, and there are many areas where this distribution is not found because there are many conditions that affect sand size and distribution. Additional factors influencing sand grain size include the nearshore and offshore se...[Content truncated]",

These globally important fishes are experiencing sharp population declines as a result of human activity in the oceans. Research to understand elasmobranch ecology and conservation is critical and has now begun to explore the role of body-associated microbiomes in shaping elasmobranch health. Here, we review the burgeoning efforts to understand elasmobranch microbiomes, highlighting microbiome variation among gastrointestinal, oral, skin, and blood-associated niches. We identify major bacterial lineages in the microbiome, challenges to the field, key unanswered questions, and avenues for future work. We argue for prioritizing research to determine how microbiomes interact mechanistically with the unique physiology of elasmobranchs, potentially identifying roles in host immunity, disease, nutrition, and waste processing. Understanding elasmobranch–microbiome interactions is critical for predicting how sharks and rays respond to a changing ocean and for managing healthy populations in managed care.\n### Supplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s42523-021-00121-4.\n**Keywords:** Bacteria, Sharks, Rays,...[Content truncated]",

But the operation is controversial, because whale sharks don’t naturally gather here, unlike other such sites in the country. The Oslob sharks are hand-fed, and this essentially guarantees they will show up to thrill guests, who can snap close-range photos.\nThe situation raises thorny questions, for example about the , the sustainability of such an operation, and the conservation value. Do the benefits outweigh potential downsides?\nThese questions are not merely academic, considering whale sharks are globally endangered and their numbers in the Philippines region are in steep decline. Prior to 1998, when whale sharks gained national legal protection, hundreds of whale sharks were killed in the Philippines each year for their meat and fins.\nBut poaching still happens here and elsewhere, since demand and markets for whale sharks remain, a primary destination being China—and a single animal can fetch tens of thousands of dollars. Their meat, fins, and oil are sold for food, and their skin for bags. (Related: .)\nSunrise in Oslob\n----------------\nOslob’s day begins at six in the morning, when the first tourist arrivals listen to a short briefing—no touching, no riding, no flash photography, and keep at least six feet away from the sharks at all times. Visitors don masks, snorkels, and life jackets and board outrigger boats to see the sharks. In the “interaction area,” about 150 feet from shore, the boats line up and the show begins. Feeders in small, one-person outrigger canoes dish out handfuls of thawed shrimp to the waiting sharks, many of which time their arrival to within a few minutes of feeding.\nIt’s called “watching,” but there’s just as much “posing.” It’s a strange sight: A line of tourists in the water hold on to the boat’s outrigger. Their backs face the sharks while they mug for the cellphones being clicked by the boat operator. The beasts are the backdrop.\nGuests are told they can go to jail if they touch or get too close to the sharks, but researchers have found that —often inadvertently. It’s a melee out there, and contact happens.\n!\nAlmost all whale sharks which visit Oslob are juvenile males. Most are only temporary visitors, but a few become year-round residents.\nPhotograph by David Doubilet, National Geographic\nSome of the sharks swim languidly at a 45-degree angle, as though their tails were weighted. Others stay almost motionless, entirely vertical, slurping the shrimp with...[Content truncated]",
