As they grow and mature, the sharks move to other areas and colder water, where seals and sea lions are more abundant.\n### \nWhite sharks are widely distributed around the world, mostly in cold, temperate waters, only occasionally occurring in tropical seas. They prefer areas with sea surface temperatures of 50 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit. White sharks are commonly seen at the ocean surface but have been known to occur as deep as 6,150 ft. Juvenile white sharks are frequently seen in shallow nearshore waters off Southern California, especially in the summer and during warm water periods.\n### \nWhite sharks play a crucial role in the marine ecosystem by feeding on pinniped (seal and sea lion) populations. The only real threats white sharks face are from humans and the occasional killer whale (or orca, _Orcinus orca_).\nAccording to Burr Heneman, who drafted California's white shark protection legislation, \"white sharks, orcas, and disease are about the only factors limiting seal and sea lion populations in California, and research increasingly confirms that the white shark population is pretty small and highly vulnerable to fishing pressure.\"\n### \nIn 2014, the Fish and Game Commission determined that based on the best available science, listing the northeastern Pacific population of white shark as threatened or endangered under the California Endangered Species Act was not warranted. This was consistent with CDFW's recommendation. There are currently multiple estimates of the northeastern Pacific white shark population ranging from just a few hundred to greater than 3,000 individuals. All current estimates involve some degree of uncertainty, as there are significant gaps in understanding of white shark movements, reproductive biology and mating behaviors. Based on a thorough review of the best available scientific information, the higher estimates are more likely correct.\nData on commercial fisheries interactions provide a useful tool for studying trends in white shark populations, which are difficult to study directly due to their wide range and low density. Catch trends over the past decade suggest the juvenile white shark population in Southern California may be increasing. This is further supported by a rise in the incidental catch of white sharks in gillnet fisheries even as effort in these fisheries has declined. The apparent population increase may be due to added regulatory protections, primarily enacted in the 1990s, including state and federal prohibitions on take of white shark, and progressively restrictive regulations on gillnet gear over the same time period.\nThere are also indications that the adult population of white sharks may be increasing.

Often, the seals hear me anchor up and set up behind my boat. If I manage to hook a fish, a seal takes it right off my line. It gets worse every year as their population increases and their range expands.”\nMike “Boz” Bosley has fished the waters around the Cape for 40 years. For the last 10, he’s been out there every day since he started Dragonfly Sportfishing in Orleans. “The loudest complaints I hear about seals come from shore-based striper fishermen.

Unfortunately, contemporary narratives widely presented in popular mainstream media have attached an utterly negative connotation to sharks, propagating an unsubstantiated and fabricated image of them as implacable and voracious predators. Recently a lot of attention is devoted to understanding the public perception towards sharks in order to promote their conservation given that a quarter of all shark species are facing extinction. This work assessed the current attitude of the public towards sharks on a global scale, utilizing modern technology through a single protocol that explored the importance of factors like culture, history, or educational level in shaping attitudes. We collected 13,800 questionnaires from 137 countries, with 25 countries presenting more than 100 answers each, representing in total 92% of the filled questionnaires. A generally positive attitude towards sharks emerged from our study, influenced significantly by several factors including knowledge and participation in marine conservation projects. Interestingly, shark attacks emerged as an important factor, with countries having high numbers of shark attacks exhibiting a highly positive attitude towards sharks, potentially because their citizens are more aware of the issue and the importance of sharks for the . Guidelines for shifting public attitude towards sharks and consequently advancing shark conservation were also drawn.\nIntroduction\n------------\nSharks are among the oldest animals still surviving on the planet, showing high diversity and complex social structures \\ and representing irreplaceable elements of the integrity and the functionality of the marine communities \\, \\. Sharks' biological characteristics, slow growth, late maturity, and low fecundity make them extremely susceptible to overexploitation \\. Globally, sharks are facing an unprecedented population decline, primarily due to intensification of fisheries \\, with about 100 million sharks being killed every year \\. This is driven primarily by the demand for shark fins in Asia \\, while at the same time shark meat contributes significantly to the food security of several developing nations without being in most cases a targeted species \\.\nRecently, several researchers put effort into understanding the attitudes of different factors involved, directly or indirectly, in shark protection and shark fisheries for advancing their conservation (e.g. \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\, \\. Among other impacts, public opinion plays a significant role in shaping environmental policies \\ and is a key factor for achieving environmental “gains” \\. Human attitudes towards wildlife, not only influence the coexistence between humans and animals \\ but is also an issue of high importance in terms of conservation \\. Particularly when animal-human interactions result in conflicts, research on public attitudes is a prerequisite to developing effective strategies for the protection of wildlife species \\.\nSharks are considered one of the twenty most charismatic animals \\, however contemporary narratives still often attach them an utterly negative connotation, propagating an unsubstantiated and fabricated image of them as implacable and voracious predators \\, \\. This culture-driven negative image, which vilified sharks in the public, is currently one of the most significant issues for their conservation \\, \\. Interestingly, this perception of sharks is gradually changing \\. Surveys through questionnaires evidenced the rise of a positive shift, despite the fear still elicited by them (Australia: \\; Brazil: \\; Ecuador: \\; Mozambique: \\; UK: \\; USA: \\). This change in perception is also associated with a change in the use, from extractive to non-extractive, linked to the increase of interest in ecotourism and direct contact with these animals \\.\nThe present study aimed at assessing the current attitudes of the public towards sharks on a global scale, utilizing modern technology, with a survey that was administered online. The novelty of this work lies in the use of a single protocol that allows the exploration of how crossing social/demographic categories, and other drivers, like educational level and experiences, affect attitudes specifically for sharks. We further draw guidelines that will assist in future conservation efforts and primarily campaigning in different countries.\nSection snippets\n----------------\nSurvey design\n-------------\nA questionnaire-based survey was developed (Table A1), utilizing the attitudinal scale of Kellert \\ for assessing the attitudes of the respondents towards sharks. The questionnaire consisted of 4 parts facilitating the quantification of the results and the investigation of the relations between different factors and the attitudes.\nThe...[Content truncated]",

Whether it’s Jaws or the annual fin-fest that is Shark Week every mid-July, public interest in the giant species of fish is always high.\nOver the past 12 months, Storyful journalists have discovered, chased, verified, and published some incredible moments involving sharks. Footage licensed by Storyful shows sharks doing everything from leaping onto a boat, to attacking a kayaker off the coast of Hawaii, as well as taking on a tenacious turtle in a tense battle caught on camera by a drone operator.\nWe’ve rounded up five of our most popular shark videos from the past 12 months below, sharing details of the clips, and the sometimes-complex verification process that went into adding these pieces of UGC to the Storyful library.\n**Shark or Not? Mysterious Fish Reported in Flooded Fort Myers Neighborhood**\nPerhaps one of the biggest ‘shark’ videos of the past 12 months may not involve a shark at all. However, the mere idea that one may be swimming around a flooded Florida neighborhood had the internet fascinated.\nThis video went viral in September 2022 when inhabitants of Fort Myers believed they saw a small shark swimming through floodwaters as Hurricane Ian began hammering southwest Florida.\nThe source of this footage, Dominic Cameratta, told Storyful he captured the video on the morning of September 28 at his house in Devonwood as he watched floodwaters encroach on his neighbor’s property.\nStoryful confirmed this by cross-referencing the video with satellite imagery and real-estate photos. Metadata attached to the video file further indicated it was filmed at 8:04 am on the date in question.\nStoryful also spoke to local marine and wildlife specialists for their thoughts on the video. A spokesperson for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said its staff were “unable to identify the animal.”\nRick Bartleson, a marine scientist at the Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation, was also uncertain but, based on the shape of its dorsal fin, said he was doubtful that it was a shark.\n**‘It’s on the Boat!’ Shark Lands on New Zealand Fishing Vessel**\nYou may think that any surprise involving a shark would be unwelcome, but not so for a group of people on a fishing charter off Whitianga, New Zealand, last November.\nThe group were stunned when a large mako shark leapt out of the water and...[Content truncated]"

As they grow and mature, the sharks move to other areas and colder water, where seals and sea lions are more abundant.\n### \nWhite sharks are widely distributed around the world, mostly in cold, temperate waters, only occasionally occurring in tropical seas. They prefer areas with sea surface temperatures of 50 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit. White sharks are commonly seen at the ocean surface but have been known to occur as deep as 6,150 ft. Juvenile white sharks are frequently seen in shallow nearshore waters off Southern California, especially in the summer and during warm water periods.\n### \nWhite sharks play a crucial role in the marine ecosystem by feeding on pinniped (seal and sea lion) populations. The only real threats white sharks face are from humans and the occasional killer whale (or orca, _Orcinus orca_).\nAccording to Burr Heneman, who drafted California's white shark protection legislation, \"white sharks, orcas, and disease are about the only factors limiting seal and sea lion populations in California, and research increasingly confirms that the white shark population is pretty small and highly vulnerable to fishing pressure.\"\n### \nIn 2014, the Fish and Game Commission determined that based on the best available science, listing the northeastern Pacific population of white shark as threatened or endangered under the California Endangered Species Act was not warranted. This was consistent with CDFW's recommendation. There are currently multiple estimates of the northeastern Pacific white shark population ranging from just a few hundred to greater than 3,000 individuals. All current estimates involve some degree of uncertainty, as there are significant gaps in understanding of white shark movements, reproductive biology and mating behaviors. Based on a thorough review of the best available scientific information, the higher estimates are more likely correct.\nData on commercial fisheries interactions provide a useful tool for studying trends in white shark populations, which are difficult to study directly due to their wide range and low density. Catch trends over the past decade suggest the juvenile white shark population in Southern California may be increasing. This is further supported by a rise in the incidental catch of white sharks in gillnet fisheries even as effort in these fisheries has declined. The apparent population increase may be due to added regulatory protections, primarily enacted in the 1990s, including state and federal prohibitions on take of white shark, and progressively restrictive regulations on gillnet gear over the same time period.\nThere are also indications that the adult population of white sharks may be increasing. White shark attacks on marine mammals at Southeast Farallon Island have been documented...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What specific visual evidence in the video might indicate a potential fabrication of the surfer and shark interaction?",
        "Answer": "The claim that a surfer is being towed by a great white shark is not substantiated by the evidence presented in the video. Here are some specific visual elements from the video that might indicate a potential fabrication of the surfer and shark interaction:\n\n1. **Lack of Direct Evidence**: The video does not include any clear visual evidence showing a direct interaction between a surfer and a shark, such as the surfer being physically towed or pulled by the shark. Instead, the footage includes general surfing scenes and a distant dorsal fin, which does not provide direct substantiation of the claim involving towing. This absence of explicit interaction raises doubts about the authenticity of the claims surrounding the video.\n\n2. **Context of Shark Sightings**: The video includes depictions of a shark's dorsal fin but does not show any aggressive behavior or towing action associated with it. Different reports about shark sightings, including anecdotes from surfers who have seen sharks in proximity while surfing, suggest that such interactions are often exaggerated or misrepresented in media. For instance, a Reddit post highlighted a surfer's encounter with a shark that was merely noted as a passing sighting rather than an aggressive interaction.\n\n3. **Viral Video Trends**: Recently, viral videos involving shark interactions have come under scrutiny for authenticity, often being linked to sensationalized or staged behavior meant for entertainment. One article discusses the phenomenon of shark videos capturing public fascination but often lacking verification or being misinterpreted. This context of viral media phenomena suggests that the interaction presented in this video could also be exaggerated or fabricated for dramatic effect.\n\nBased on the evaluation of the evidence and the lack of conclusive interactions shown in the video, my confidence in this analysis is about **90%**. The reasoning is supported by both the absence of direct evidence in the video itself and the broader context of how shark videos can misrepresent true interactions.",
