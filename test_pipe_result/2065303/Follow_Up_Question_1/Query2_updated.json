Or is it black and blue? David Sillito explains\nAlso in February, a garment now consigned to history as simply \"the dress\" was stirring debate.\nOptical illusion, colour blindness', strange lighting - whatever caused the difference of opinion, the image of the white/gold or blue/black dress became one of the most shared of the year.\nAnd then we all agreed it was blue and black. Didn't we?\nMartin Le-May caught the moment when the woodpecker took flight with a weasel on its back\nIf Katy Perry's Left Shark was a symbol of life's daily struggles, the shot of a weasel hitching a ride on a woodpecker is a reminder of how we should all be able to get along, no matter our differences.\n\"Weasels are fearless,\" commented wildlife expert Lucy Cooke....[Content truncated]",

Because sometimes your perception of what happened and what actually happened are two different things.\u201d\nDurand used a helmet-mounted camera to record the shark swimming beneath and around him while he was standup paddle-boarding on a clear day about 200 yards offshore, in front of the iconic smokestacks of the Scattergood Generating Station near El Porto.\nDurand\u2019s footage is one of a series of recent shark sightings caught on video in the Santa Monica Bay and along other parts of Southern California\u2019s shore.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely had an increase in spottings. What we\u2019re waiting for is to verify if this is an anomaly or a cyclical pattern,\u201d said Capt. Kyle Daniels of the county Fire Department Lifeguard Division. \u201cWe\u2019ve had sightings pretty actively since the end of June, early July. \u2026 I\u2019ve seen over the summer a half a dozen shark videos that people have taken to the media.\u201d\nDaniels, who is based in Manhattan Beach, said the Sheriff\u2019s Department has not \u201c100 percent verified\u201d that the sharks being seen off the coast are great whites, although it is likely they are.\nIn July, a sheriff\u2019s helicopter crew flying near El Porto cleared people from the water with a public address system after spotting a shark.\nThe day after, the Sheriff\u2019s Department released a list of \u201cshark safety tips,\u201d including avoiding bright swimwear or venturing into the water with a bleeding wound.\nBy all accounts, the sharks that have recently visited local shores are all juveniles, which feed on sting rays and other bottom fish.\n\u201cThe marine biologists have told us there have never been juvenile white shark attacks on humans,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cThey\u2019re still wild animals.

Whether it\u2019s Jaws or the annual fin-fest that is Shark Week every mid-July, public interest in the giant species of fish is always high.\nOver the past 12 months, Storyful journalists have discovered, chased, verified, and published some incredible moments involving sharks. Footage licensed by Storyful shows sharks doing everything from leaping onto a boat, to attacking a kayaker off the coast of Hawaii, as well as taking on a tenacious turtle in a tense battle caught on camera by a drone operator.\nWe\u2019ve rounded up five of our most popular shark videos from the past 12 months below, sharing details of the clips, and the sometimes-complex verification process that went into adding these pieces of UGC to the Storyful library.\n**Shark or Not?

Metadata attached to the video file further indicated it was filmed at 8:04 am on the date in question.\nStoryful also spoke to local marine and wildlife specialists for their thoughts on the video. A spokesperson for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said its staff were \u201cunable to identify the animal.\u201d\nRick Bartleson, a marine scientist at the Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation, was also uncertain but, based on the shape of its dorsal fin, said he was doubtful that it was a shark.\n**\u2018It\u2019s on the Boat!\u2019 Shark Lands on New Zealand Fishing Vessel**\nYou may think that any surprise involving a shark would be unwelcome, but not so for a group of people on a fishing charter off Whitianga, New Zealand, last November.\nThe group were stunned when a large mako shark leapt out of the water and...[Content truncated]",
