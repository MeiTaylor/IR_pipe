Consider this list a safe, feel-good haven.\nRule number two: nothing in this list was created specifically to go viral.\nAs in, a committee of advertising executives didn't sit around a room and decide how to spend money on making it a hit.\nOf course, everyone wants their posts to be popular, but let's just say this list is intended to feature some of the more organic fun.\nOff we go!\nRuairi McSorley has turned his \"frostbit\" soundbite into a media career\nOne of the remarkable things about Ruairi McSorley is how he managed to change a tiny soundbite into a media career.\nAsked by UTV reporter Gareth Wilkinson about the weather conditions in Northern Ireland, McSorley's charming accent led to him being dubbed the most Irish man in the world, external.\nHis \"frostbit\" soundbite has led to countless TV appearances, events and, soon, a charity single.\nKaty Perry's Superbowl appearance went viral thanks to Left Shark\nIf you're not a fan of American Football - and sometimes even if you are - the half-time show is the most interesting part of the sporting extravaganza. \nAnd not since Janet Jackson's wardrobe \"malfunction\" has their been a more talked about moment than singer Katy Perry's performance.\nShe was joined on stage by two adorable backing dancers, although one of them, the shark on the left, struggled to keep up.\nLeft Shark fever swept the world, coming to symbolise the daily struggles we all face to keep up with the world.\nKaty Perry's lawyers tried to trademark \"left shark\", but were denied.\nThis video can not be played\nIs it white and gold? Or is it black and blue? David Sillito explains\nAlso in February, a garment now consigned to history as simply \"the dress\" was stirring debate.\nOptical illusion, colour blindness', strange lighting - whatever caused the difference of opinion, the image of the white/gold or blue/black dress became one of the most shared of the year.\nAnd then we all agreed it was blue and black. Didn't we?\nMartin Le-May caught the moment when the woodpecker took flight with a weasel on its back\nIf Katy Perry's Left Shark was a symbol of life's daily struggles, the shot of a weasel hitching a ride on a woodpecker is a reminder of how we should all be able to get along, no matter our differences.\n\"Weasels are fearless,\" commented wildlife expert Lucy Cooke....[Content truncated]",

Because sometimes your perception of what happened and what actually happened are two different things.‚Äù\nDurand used a helmet-mounted camera to record the shark swimming beneath and around him while he was standup paddle-boarding on a clear day about 200 yards offshore, in front of the iconic smokestacks of the Scattergood Generating Station near El Porto.\nDurand‚Äôs footage is one of a series of recent shark sightings caught on video in the Santa Monica Bay and along other parts of Southern California‚Äôs shore.\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve definitely had an increase in spottings. What we‚Äôre waiting for is to verify if this is an anomaly or a cyclical pattern,‚Äù said Capt. Kyle Daniels of the county Fire Department Lifeguard Division. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had sightings pretty actively since the end of June, early July. ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve seen over the summer a half a dozen shark videos that people have taken to the media.‚Äù\nDaniels, who is based in Manhattan Beach, said the Sheriff‚Äôs Department has not ‚Äú100 percent verified‚Äù that the sharks being seen off the coast are great whites, although it is likely they are.\nIn July, a sheriff‚Äôs helicopter crew flying near El Porto cleared people from the water with a public address system after spotting a shark.\nThe day after, the Sheriff‚Äôs Department released a list of ‚Äúshark safety tips,‚Äù including avoiding bright swimwear or venturing into the water with a bleeding wound.\nBy all accounts, the sharks that have recently visited local shores are all juveniles, which feed on sting rays and other bottom fish.\n‚ÄúThe marine biologists have told us there have never been juvenile white shark attacks on humans,‚Äù Daniels said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still wild animals.

Whether it‚Äôs Jaws or the annual fin-fest that is Shark Week every mid-July, public interest in the giant species of fish is always high.\nOver the past 12 months, Storyful journalists have discovered, chased, verified, and published some incredible moments involving sharks. Footage licensed by Storyful shows sharks doing everything from leaping onto a boat, to attacking a kayaker off the coast of Hawaii, as well as taking on a tenacious turtle in a tense battle caught on camera by a drone operator.\nWe‚Äôve rounded up five of our most popular shark videos from the past 12 months below, sharing details of the clips, and the sometimes-complex verification process that went into adding these pieces of UGC to the Storyful library.\n**Shark or Not? Mysterious Fish Reported in Flooded Fort Myers Neighborhood**\nPerhaps one of the biggest ‚Äòshark‚Äô videos of the past 12 months may not involve a shark at all. However, the mere idea that one may be swimming around a flooded Florida neighborhood had the internet fascinated.\nThis video went viral in September 2022 when inhabitants of Fort Myers believed they saw a small shark swimming through floodwaters as Hurricane Ian began hammering southwest Florida.\nThe source of this footage, Dominic Cameratta, told Storyful he captured the video on the morning of September 28 at his house in Devonwood as he watched floodwaters encroach on his neighbor‚Äôs property.\nStoryful confirmed this by cross-referencing the video with satellite imagery and real-estate photos. Metadata attached to the video file further indicated it was filmed at 8:04 am on the date in question.\nStoryful also spoke to local marine and wildlife specialists for their thoughts on the video. A spokesperson for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said its staff were ‚Äúunable to identify the animal.‚Äù\nRick Bartleson, a marine scientist at the Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation, was also uncertain but, based on the shape of its dorsal fin, said he was doubtful that it was a shark.\n**‚ÄòIt‚Äôs on the Boat!‚Äô Shark Lands on New Zealand Fishing Vessel**\nYou may think that any surprise involving a shark would be unwelcome, but not so for a group of people on a fishing charter off Whitianga, New Zealand, last November.\nThe group were stunned when a large mako shark leapt out of the water and...[Content truncated]",
