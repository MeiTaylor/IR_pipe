Collectively,  produced a median score of 59, up from 58 the previous year.\nTrump International Hotel & Tower Chicago, meanwhile, registered a score of nine, tied with Rush University Medical Center for the lowest rating among the city\u2019s 100 biggest buildings.\nAlthough Trump\u2019s building, at 401 N. Wabash Ave., is among the largest in terms of square footage, the  adjusts measurements based on property size, use, hours and other factors.

The tax filings that the public does know about have come from past reporting by the Times and a public release of records by Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee in 2022.\nTrump's presidential campaign provided a statement in son Eric Trump's name saying the IRS inquiry was settled years ago, only to be brought back to life once my father ran for office. We are confident in our position.\nThe tax records cited by the report indicate that Trump twice deducted losses on the Trump International Hotel and Tower, which opened in 2009 near the banks of the Chicago River that cuts through that city's downtown.\nThe report said Trump initially reported losses of $658 million in his 2008 filings under the premise that the property fit the IRS definition of being worthless because condominium sales were disappointing and retail space went unfilled amid a deep US recession.\nBut in 2010, the published report said, Trump transferred the ownership of the property to a different holding company that he also controlled, using the move to save money on taxes by reporting an additional $168 million in losses over the next decade on the same property.\n### More From This Section\nThe report did not have any updates on the status of the IRS inquiry since December 2022, but said Trump could owe more than $100 million, including penalties, if he were to lose the audit battle.\nTrump, meanwhile, is appealing a New York judge's ruling from February after a civil trial that Trump, his company and top executives lied about his wealth on financial statements, conning bankers and insurers who...[Content truncated]",

However, people hoping for another sighting in the South and portions of the central United States may be out of luck.\n    \n\n            \u201cNo more vibrant aurora for Florida or any other \u2018unusual\u2019 places,\u201d said CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar.\n    \n\n            \u201cToday is when we see the big shift back to the north for the lights,\u201d Chinchar said. \u201cSo all the usual places you would see the aurora, like Iceland, Canada, Scandinavian countries, etc. \u2026. that\u2019s where the focus will be going forward.\u201d\n    \n\n            In general, it\u2019s good to start looking during the time right after sunset. Weather, of course, is key, as cloud cover may limit the visibility of the aurora.\n    \n\n            Mostly clear conditions are expected in the northern portion of the US including Minneapolis and Fargo, North Dakota \u2013 some of the locations with the greatest chance of seeing the auroras on Sunday evening, according to Chinchar.\n    \n\n            But thicker cloud cover may inhibit viewing opportunities in a few spots in the Pacific Northwest and around the Great Lakes region.\n    \n\n            Green Bay, Wisconsin, is included in the area with the best viewing opportunities but those may be hampered by a chance of clouds and rain Sunday night, Chinchar said.\n    \n\n            New York City; Seattle, Washington; and Chicago are among locations where the auroras will possibly be visible on Sunday.\n    \n\n            The Space Weather Prediction Center, a division of the National Weather Service, observed conditions of an extreme geomagnetic storm at 6:54 p.m. ET on Friday evening, reaching a level 5 out of 5 severity. The last time a solar storm of this magnitude reached Earth was in October 2003, resulting in power outages in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa, according to the center.\n    \n\n            Signs of a severe geomagnetic storm, or level 4, were first observed by scientists at the center at 12:37 p.m. ET, when a major disturbance was detected in Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Previously, the center issued a geomagnetic storm watch on Thursday evening, the first such watch issued since January 2005.\n    \n\n            But the forecast was upgraded after scientists observed G5, or extreme geomagnetic storm, conditions Friday evening.\n    \n\n            As the sun nears the peak of activity in its 11-year cycle, known as\u00a0solar maximum, later this year, researchers have observed increasingly intense solar flares erupting from the fiery orb.\n    \n\n            Increased solar...[Content truncated]",

Biden Jr., as soft on , in part by pointing to his son\u2019s business dealings there.\nSenate Republicans produced a report asserting, among other things, that Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter \u201copened a bank account\u201d with a Chinese businessman, part of what it said were his numerous connections to \u201cforeign nationals and foreign governments across the globe.\u201d\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s own business history is filled with overseas financial deals, and some have involved the Chinese state. He spent a decade unsuccessfully pursuing projects in China, operating an office there during his first run for president and forging a partnership with a major government-controlled company.\nAnd it turns out that China is one of only three foreign nations \u2014 the others are Britain and Ireland \u2014 where Mr. Trump maintains a bank account, according to an analysis of the president\u2019s tax records, . The foreign accounts do not show up on Mr. Trump\u2019s public financial disclosures, where he must list personal assets, because they are held under corporate names. The identities of the financial institutions are not clear.\nThe Chinese account is controlled by Trump International Hotels Management L.L.C., which the tax records show paid $188,561 in taxes in China while pursuing licensing deals there from 2013 to 2015.\nThe tax records do not include details on how much money may have passed through the overseas accounts, though the Internal Revenue Service does require filers to report the portion of their income derived from other countries. The British and Irish accounts are held by companies that operate Mr. Trump\u2019s golf courses in Scotland and Ireland, which regularly report millions of dollars in revenue from those countries. Trump International Hotels Management reported just a few thousand dollars from China.\n* * *\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

She eventually relented and switched the programming from a sporting contest to a political one\u2014though she left the sound muted, forcing us to endure the tepid sounds of corporate lounge music instead of Wolf Blitzer\u2019s tenor. Which, in retrospect, was probably the right choice.\nI read the closed captioning\u00a0while everyone else buried their heads in their cocktails or conversation, and when the red \u201cTrump Wins Illinois\u201d graphic appeared on television, I became the one to break the news to Trump Tower drinkers. Jeff was the only Rebar patron to react. He\u2019d been splitting his time between banter with an old high school friend (\u201cClass of \u201996!\u201d he said proudly) and tossing cringe-worthy pickup lines at the female bartender, all the while sipping on a steady stream of Red Bull-and-vodka cocktails. Jeff turned to me after I announced the results, and offered up a high five that I very, very reluctantly accepted.\n\u201cI just won $500!

He\u2019d also been stationed in the front row of the UIC rally\u2014he showed me his pictures of the podium on his phone\u2014to get a glimpse of the Donald in person. He told me he was disappointed by Trump\u2019s no-show, especially after waiting in line for four hours, although he blamed the protesters.\n\u201cThey were paid by someone to do it,\u201d he claimed. \u201cThey were too well orchestrated not to be. It was a perfect setup.\u201d His continued enthusiasm for the billionaire translated into a $500 bet with a friend in Rockford that Trump would win the Illinois GOP primary. Then he splurged for a $350-a-night room at the Trump International Hotel for good luck.\nBut then Jeff hedges on his offer to splurge on shots for the rest of us. Perhaps taking a cue his favorite presidential candidate, he tries, unsuccessfully, to hector poor Ellie into giving us free shots to compensate for a faulty pen she gave him to sign his tab. (\u201cYou think Trump would accept a broken pen?\u201d)\nJeff also makes one last-ditch effort to sweet-talk Ellie into going clubbing with him at a place called Untitled in...[Content truncated]",
