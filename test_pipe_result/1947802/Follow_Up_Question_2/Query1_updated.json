(Matt Masterson / WTTW News)\nAs Donald Trump took the stage Wednesday to speak inside Hilton Chicago, protesters gathered outside and decried the former president as a \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cweirdo.\u201d\nThanks to our sponsors:\n-----------------------\n---------------------------------------------------\nA few dozen protesters gathered outside the hotel Wednesday morning where they said Trump was not welcome in Chicago ahead of his appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists\u2019 annual convention. Trump spoke in a conversation moderated by three journalists.\n\u201cRacist Trump, the racist Republican Party, the reactionary policies, the fascist policies and their candidate are just not welcome in this city,\u201d Hatem Abudayyeh, chair of the Chicago-based U.S. Palestinian Community Network told WTTW News. \u201cThe vast majority of Chicagoans feel that way, the vast majority of people in the United States feel that way as well.

His NABJ convention speaking event was only announced this week.\nThe hastily assembled protest Wednesday along South Michigan Avenue remained peaceful as attendees chanted \u201cRacist, sexist, anti-gay, Donald Trump go away\u201d and \u201cSay it loud, say it clear, Donald Trump\u2019s not welcome here.\u201d\nA six-piece brass band also sang \u201cTrump\u2019s not like us\u201d to the tune of Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d\nChicago police blocked off side streets near the hotel, but traffic continued unabated along Michigan Avenue.\nThe rally included several speakers who protested Trump and his presidential campaign during the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee earlier this month and plan to organize again for the Democratic National Convention next month in Chicago.\nAmong them was Kobi Guillory, an activist with the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, who said Trump should not be given a platform to speak in Chicago.\n\u201cEvery time he\u2019s making his racist points, what city does he use to make his racist talking points?

While it does not mention light displays directly, it indicates an organized protest atmosphere, which could imply various forms of expression that might include lights. However, it does not provide specific evidence of light displays by Trump Tower residents."
