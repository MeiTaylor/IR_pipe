It was called “Meet the Billionaire,” and 18 million people watched. The episodes that followed climbed to roughly 20 million each week. A staggering 28 million viewers tuned in to watch the first season finale. The series won an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program, and the Television Critics Association called it one of the best TV shows of the year, alongside _The Sopranos_ and _Arrested Development_. The series—alongside its bawdy sibling, _The Celebrity Apprentice_—appeared on NBC in coveted prime-time slots for more than a decade.\n_The Apprentice_ was an instant success in another way too. It elevated Donald J. Trump from sleazy New York tabloid hustler to respectable household name. In the show, he appeared to demonstrate impeccable business instincts and unparalleled wealth, even though his businesses had barely survived multiple bankruptcies and faced yet another when he was cast.

And based on new energy use data from the city, neither is his trademark Chicago skyscraper.\nOf the 100 largest buildings listed in  database, the president-elect’s 98-story riverfront tower ranks last in energy performance. The rating is based on the Environmental Protection Agency’s Energy Star scoring system, which measures how efficiently buildings use energy on a scale of 1 to 100, with 50 indicating average energy performance.\nAlmost two-thirds of the city’s biggest buildings (65 out of 100) had above-average scores, according to data collected in 2015 and published last month on the city’s data portal. Collectively,  produced a median score of 59, up from 58 the previous year.\nTrump International Hotel & Tower Chicago, meanwhile, registered a score of nine, tied with Rush University Medical Center for the lowest rating among the city’s 100 biggest buildings.\nAlthough Trump’s building, at 401 N. Wabash Ave., is among the largest in terms of square footage, the  adjusts measurements based on property size, use, hours and other factors. A building’s score, therefore, provides a level comparison to other buildings with similar characteristics.\n“You’re comparing hotels against hotels and office buildings against office buildings,” said Katie Kaluzny, associate director of the U.S. Green Building Council – Illinois Chapter, which promotes environmentally responsible buildings. “They’re adjusted based on how energy is used at those sites.”\nIn other words, Trump Chicago’s score (a nine on a 1 to 100 scale) is as bad as it sounds.\n(City Energy Project / NRDC & IMT)]\nBy comparison, other notable Chicago skyscrapers scored far better than Trump’s tower, including Willis Tower (55), John Hancock Center (45), Prudential Plaza (88), Aon Center (82), Tribune Tower (77) and Marina Towers (43). City Hall beat Trump’s building but scored just a 36.\nTrump’s building also ranked behind other top hotels in the city, such as Drake Hotel (68), Hyatt Regency (57...[Content truncated]",

The tax filings that the public does know about have come from past reporting by the Times and a public release of records by Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee in 2022.\nTrump's presidential campaign provided a statement in son Eric Trump's name saying the IRS inquiry was settled years ago, only to be brought back to life once my father ran for office. We are confident in our position.\nThe tax records cited by the report indicate that Trump twice deducted losses on the Trump International Hotel and Tower, which opened in 2009 near the banks of the Chicago River that cuts through that city's downtown.\nThe report said Trump initially reported losses of $658 million in his 2008 filings under the premise that the property fit the IRS definition of being worthless because condominium sales were disappointing and retail space went unfilled amid a deep US recession.\nBut in 2010, the published report said, Trump transferred the ownership of the property to a different holding company that he also controlled, using the move to save money on taxes by reporting an additional $168 million in losses over the next decade on the same property.\n### More From This Section\nThe report did not have any updates on the status of the IRS inquiry since December 2022, but said Trump could owe more than $100 million, including penalties, if he were to lose the audit battle.\nTrump, meanwhile, is appealing a New York judge's ruling from February after a civil trial that Trump, his company and top executives lied about his wealth on financial statements, conning bankers and insurers who...[Content truncated]",

However, people hoping for another sighting in the South and portions of the central United States may be out of luck.\n    \n\n            “No more vibrant aurora for Florida or any other ‘unusual’ places,” said CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar.\n    \n\n            “Today is when we see the big shift back to the north for the lights,” Chinchar said. “So all the usual places you would see the aurora, like Iceland, Canada, Scandinavian countries, etc. …. that’s where the focus will be going forward.”\n    \n\n            In general, it’s good to start looking during the time right after sunset. Weather, of course, is key, as cloud cover may limit the visibility of the aurora.\n    \n\n            Mostly clear conditions are expected in the northern portion of the US including Minneapolis and Fargo, North Dakota – some of the locations with the greatest chance of seeing the auroras on Sunday evening, according to Chinchar.\n    \n\n            But thicker cloud cover may inhibit viewing opportunities in a few spots in the Pacific Northwest and around the Great Lakes region.\n    \n\n            Green Bay, Wisconsin, is included in the area with the best viewing opportunities but those may be hampered by a chance of clouds and rain Sunday night, Chinchar said.\n    \n\n            New York City; Seattle, Washington; and Chicago are among locations where the auroras will possibly be visible on Sunday.\n    \n\n            The Space Weather Prediction Center, a division of the National Weather Service, observed conditions of an extreme geomagnetic storm at 6:54 p.m. ET on Friday evening, reaching a level 5 out of 5 severity. The last time a solar storm of this magnitude reached Earth was in October 2003, resulting in power outages in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa, according to the center.\n    \n\n            Signs of a severe geomagnetic storm, or level 4, were first observed by scientists at the center at 12:37 p.m. ET, when a major disturbance was detected in Earth’s magnetic field. Previously, the center issued a geomagnetic storm watch on Thursday evening, the first such watch issued since January 2005.\n    \n\n            But the forecast was upgraded after scientists observed G5, or extreme geomagnetic storm, conditions Friday evening.\n    \n\n            As the sun nears the peak of activity in its 11-year cycle, known as solar maximum, later this year, researchers have observed increasingly intense solar flares erupting from the fiery orb.\n    \n\n            Increased solar...[Content truncated]",

Biden Jr., as soft on , in part by pointing to his son’s business dealings there.\nSenate Republicans produced a report asserting, among other things, that Mr. Biden’s son Hunter “opened a bank account” with a Chinese businessman, part of what it said were his numerous connections to “foreign nationals and foreign governments across the globe.”\nBut Mr. Trump’s own business history is filled with overseas financial deals, and some have involved the Chinese state. He spent a decade unsuccessfully pursuing projects in China, operating an office there during his first run for president and forging a partnership with a major government-controlled company.\nAnd it turns out that China is one of only three foreign nations — the others are Britain and Ireland — where Mr. Trump maintains a bank account, according to an analysis of the president’s tax records, . The foreign accounts do not show up on Mr. Trump’s public financial disclosures, where he must list personal assets, because they are held under corporate names. The identities of the financial institutions are not clear.\nThe Chinese account is controlled by Trump International Hotels Management L.L.C., which the tax records show paid $188,561 in taxes in China while pursuing licensing deals there from 2013 to 2015.\nThe tax records do not include details on how much money may have passed through the overseas accounts, though the Internal Revenue Service does require filers to report the portion of their income derived from other countries. The British and Irish accounts are held by companies that operate Mr. Trump’s golf courses in Scotland and Ireland, which regularly report millions of dollars in revenue from those countries. Trump International Hotels Management reported just a few thousand dollars from China.\n* * *\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

But “Jeff”—a hardcore Trump supporter from Rockford—kept hounding the bartender, “Ellie,” to change the channel to CNN for election results. She eventually relented and switched the programming from a sporting contest to a political one—though she left the sound muted, forcing us to endure the tepid sounds of corporate lounge music instead of Wolf Blitzer’s tenor. Which, in retrospect, was probably the right choice.\nI read the closed captioning while everyone else buried their heads in their cocktails or conversation, and when the red “Trump Wins Illinois” graphic appeared on television, I became the one to break the news to Trump Tower drinkers. Jeff was the only Rebar patron to react. He’d been splitting his time between banter with an old high school friend (“Class of ’96!” he said proudly) and tossing cringe-worthy pickup lines at the female bartender, all the while sipping on a steady stream of Red Bull-and-vodka cocktails. Jeff turned to me after I announced the results, and offered up a high five that I very, very reluctantly accepted.\n“I just won $500! Shots are on me!” he shouted.\n!\nThe overpriced $17 “Fear Not” cocktail at the Trump hotel’s Rebar.Credit: Ryan Smith\nJeff, it turned out, was the only one in the whole place who had come to bask in Trump’s electoral glory.

It was a perfect setup.” His continued enthusiasm for the billionaire translated into a $500 bet with a friend in Rockford that Trump would win the Illinois GOP primary. Then he splurged for a $350-a-night room at the Trump International Hotel for good luck.\nBut then Jeff hedges on his offer to splurge on shots for the rest of us. Perhaps taking a cue his favorite presidential candidate, he tries, unsuccessfully, to hector poor Ellie into giving us free shots to compensate for a faulty pen she gave him to sign his tab. (“You think Trump would accept a broken pen?”)\nJeff also makes one last-ditch effort to sweet-talk Ellie into going clubbing with him at a place called Untitled in...[Content truncated]",
