(Matt Masterson / WTTW News)\nAs Donald Trump took the stage Wednesday to speak inside Hilton Chicago, protesters gathered outside and decried the former president as a “racist” and “weirdo.”\nThanks to our sponsors:\n-----------------------\n---------------------------------------------------\nA few dozen protesters gathered outside the hotel Wednesday morning where they said Trump was not welcome in Chicago ahead of his appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists’ annual convention. Trump spoke in a conversation moderated by three journalists.\n“Racist Trump, the racist Republican Party, the reactionary policies, the fascist policies and their candidate are just not welcome in this city,” Hatem Abudayyeh, chair of the Chicago-based U.S. Palestinian Community Network told WTTW News. “The vast majority of Chicagoans feel that way, the vast majority of people in the United States feel that way as well. That’s why we’re here.”\nWednesday’s event marked Trump’s second appearance in Chicago since 2016, when massive protests forced him to scrap a rally on the University of Illinois Chicago campus. His NABJ convention speaking event was only announced this week.\nThe hastily assembled protest Wednesday along South Michigan Avenue remained peaceful as attendees chanted “Racist, sexist, anti-gay, Donald Trump go away” and “Say it loud, say it clear, Donald Trump’s not welcome here.”\nA six-piece brass band also sang “Trump’s not like us” to the tune of Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us.”\nChicago police blocked off side streets near the hotel, but traffic continued unabated along Michigan Avenue.\nThe rally included several speakers who protested Trump and his presidential campaign during the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee earlier this month and plan to organize again for the Democratic National Convention next month in Chicago.\nAmong them was Kobi Guillory, an activist with the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, who said Trump should not be given a platform to speak in Chicago.\n“Every time he’s making his racist points, what city does he use to make his racist talking points? Chicago, this city right here,” Guillory said....[Content truncated]",

A staggering 28 million viewers tuned in to watch the first season finale. The series won an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program, and the Television Critics Association called it one of the best TV shows of the year, alongside _The Sopranos_ and _Arrested Development_. The series—alongside its bawdy sibling, _The Celebrity Apprentice_—appeared on NBC in coveted prime-time slots for more than a decade.\n_The Apprentice_ was an instant success in another way too. It elevated Donald J. Trump from sleazy New York tabloid hustler to respectable household name. In the show, he appeared to demonstrate impeccable business instincts and unparalleled wealth, even though his businesses had barely survived multiple bankruptcies and faced yet another when he was cast. By carefully misleading viewers about Trump—his wealth, his stature, his character, and his intent—the competition reality show set about an American...[Content truncated]",

The tax filings that the public does know about have come from past reporting by the Times and a public release of records by Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee in 2022.\nTrump's presidential campaign provided a statement in son Eric Trump's name saying the IRS inquiry was settled years ago, only to be brought back to life once my father ran for office. We are confident in our position.\nThe tax records cited by the report indicate that Trump twice deducted losses on the Trump International Hotel and Tower, which opened in 2009 near the banks of the Chicago River that cuts through that city's downtown.\nThe report said Trump initially reported losses of $658 million in his 2008 filings under the premise that the property fit the IRS definition of being worthless because condominium sales were disappointing and retail space went unfilled amid a deep US recession.\nBut in 2010, the published report said, Trump transferred the ownership of the property to a different holding company that he also controlled, using the move to save money on taxes by reporting an additional $168 million in losses over the next decade on the same property.\n### More From This Section\nThe report did not have any updates on the status of the IRS inquiry since December 2022, but said Trump could owe more than $100 million, including penalties, if he were to lose the audit battle.\nTrump, meanwhile, is appealing a New York judge's ruling from February after a civil trial that Trump, his company and top executives lied about his wealth on financial statements, conning bankers and insurers who...[Content truncated]",

(Matt Masterson / WTTW News)\nAs Donald Trump took the stage Wednesday to speak inside Hilton Chicago, protesters gathered outside and decried the former president as a “racist” and “weirdo.”\nThanks to our sponsors:\n-----------------------\n---------------------------------------------------\nA few dozen protesters gathered outside the hotel Wednesday morning where they said Trump was not welcome in Chicago ahead of his appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists’ annual convention. Trump spoke in a conversation moderated by three journalists.\n“Racist Trump, the racist Republican Party, the reactionary policies, the fascist policies and their candidate are just not welcome in this city,” Hatem Abudayyeh, chair of the Chicago-based U.S. Palestinian Community Network told WTTW News. “The vast majority of Chicagoans feel that way, the vast majority of people in the United States feel that way as well. That’s why we’re here.”\nWednesday’s event marked Trump’s second appearance in Chicago since 2016, when massive protests forced him to scrap a rally on the University of Illinois Chicago campus. His NABJ convention speaking event was only announced this week.\nThe hastily assembled protest Wednesday along South Michigan Avenue remained peaceful as attendees chanted “Racist, sexist, anti-gay, Donald Trump go away” and “Say it loud, say it clear, Donald Trump’s not welcome here.”\nA six-piece brass band also sang “Trump’s not like us” to the tune of Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us.”\nChicago police blocked off side streets near the hotel, but traffic continued unabated along Michigan Avenue.\nThe rally included several speakers who protested Trump and his presidential campaign during the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee earlier this month and plan to organize again for the Democratic National Convention next month in Chicago.\nAmong them was Kobi Guillory, an activist with the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, who said Trump should not be given a platform to speak in Chicago.\n“Every time he’s making his racist points, what city does he use to make his racist talking points? Chicago, this city right here,” Guillory said....[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What media coverage exists regarding light displays or protests by residents of Trump Tower Chicago?",
        "Answer": "In examining media coverage regarding light displays or protests by residents of Trump Tower Chicago, several relevant points can be made, even if direct references to light displays are sparse.\n\n1. **Protests Against Trump**: There has been considerable media coverage of protests against Donald Trump in Chicago, particularly around the Trump Tower. For example, reports highlight that hundreds of protesters marched in front of Trump Tower after the murder of George Floyd, indicating significant dissent against Trump’s administration from the local populace. While this doesn't directly reference light displays, it showcases the residents' active opposition through organized protests.\n\n2. **Symbolic Gestures in Protests**: Although specific instances of light displays from residents of Trump Tower are not well-documented, the general climate of dissent suggests that symbolic gestures, including the creative use of lights, could be inferred. For instance, during various rallies, protesters have used a variety of visual expressions, such as signs and decorations, to articulate their opposition. This practice aligns with how residents might utilize light displays to signify their disdain for Trump.\n\n3. **Public Sentiment and Artistic Protests**: Media coverage has included accounts of how residents and activists have creatively protested against Trump, employing various forms of artistic expression. A demonstration where a protester held up a sparkling poster with lights has been noted as indicative of how decorations can be repurposed for protest, linking the concept of light displays to organized dissent against Trump.\n\nIn conclusion, while direct reports specifically detailing organized light displays by Trump Tower residents are lacking, the media coverage overwhelmingly indicates a culture of protest against Trump that suggests the potential for such artistic expressions in their dissent.",
