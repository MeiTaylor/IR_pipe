Bove brought up a failed attempt by Pecker in 1998 to stop an American Media outlet from publishing a story about Trump paramour Marla Maples.\n\u201cSeventeen years of providing Trump with a heads up about potentially negative publicity,\u201d\u00a0 Bove said.\nPecker testified for the prosecution, however, that he never paid sources or tipsters in order to kill off stories about Trump until after an August 2015 meeting with Trump where Pecker offered to be the candidate\u2019s \u201ceyes and ears\u201d on the lookout for negative stories. He paid $30,000 to a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 to a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal. He persuaded Cohen to pay Daniels\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 a secret payment that prosecutors have identified as the first act in an illegal effort by Trump to influence the 2016 presidential election.\nPecker testified that although he declined an invitation to Trump\u2019s inauguration in January 2017, he attended a White House dinner that July with his top deputy and editorial fixer, Dylan Howard. Jurors saw a photograph of Howard grinning in the Oval Office, and one of Pecker and President Trump walking together along an outdoor White House corridor, backs to the camera. Pecker testified they were heading to dinner, and on that stroll, Trump asked him, \u201cHow is Karen doing?\u201d\nPecker\u2019s testimony will continue today.\nMust Read Stories\n-----------------\nHide Articles\n*   ### \n    !\n*   ### \n    !\n*   ### \n    !\n*   ### \n    !\nMore from this Story Arc\nTrump Hush Money Trial\n----------------------\n*   April 30, 2024\n    ### \n*   April 30, 2024\n    ### \nRead More About:\n----------------\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \nSubscribe to Deadline\n---------------------\nGet our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.\n8 Comments\n----------\nLoading comments...\nSidebar\n-------\n### Trending on Deadline\n*   ]\n*   ]\n...[Content truncated]",

And if he does it again, the judge warned, he could be jailed.\nProsecutors had alleged 10 violations, but New York Judge Juan M. Merchan found there were nine. The ruling was a stinging rebuke for the presumptive Republican nominee, who had insisted he was exercising his free speech rights. Trump stared down at the table in front of him as the judge read the ruling, frowning slightly.\nMerchan wrote that he is \u201ckeenly aware of, and protective of,\u201d Trump\u2019s First Amendment rights, \u201cparticularly given his candidacy for the office of President of the United States.\u201d\n\u201cIt is critically important that defendant\u2019s legitimate free speech rights not be curtailed, that he be able to fully campaign for the office which he seeks and that he be able to respond and defend himself against political attacks,\u201d Merchan wrote.\nStill, he warned, that the court...[Content truncated]",

It was almost like he wanted to one-up me, to talk about himself.\"\nEventually, she said she \"had enough of his arrogance and cutting me off and not giving me my dinner.\" She testified that she asked him, \"Are you always this rude, arrogant and pompous?\" and said, \"Someone should spank you.\"\nTrump gave her a magazine, Daniels testified. \"I don't think he thought I would do it,\" she said. \"So, I took it from him and said, 'Turn around,' and I swatted him \u2026 right on the butt.\"\nThe conversation turned to \"The Apprentice,\" Daniels remembered.

The rainbow move captured international attention, and advocates say it shows how people are fighting back against anti-2SLGBTQ+ policies. (Keith Holden)\nMatt McAllister was dismayed to learn that there would be no display of rainbow lights illuminating the bridge in his home of Jacksonville, Fla., for Pride month this year. For him, it was yet another sign of the state government's disdain for the 2SLGBTQ community.\nJacksonville's Acosta bridge, spanning the St. Johns River, is one of many across the state that are only being lit up in red, white and blue from Memorial Day until Labour Day this year.\nFlorida Department of Transportation Secretary Jared Purdue , to coincide with what Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis declared  \u2014 a tax holiday for some recreational activities and supplies \u2014 effectively barring all other illuminations for celebrations like Pride month, which began on June 1.\n*   \n*   \nRather than getting angry, McAllister got creative. On the eve of Pride month, he helped\u00a0organize\u00a0a rainbow rebellion of sorts, to create a colourful light display across another nearby bridge in a show of support, solidarity and celebration of the 2SLGBTQ+ community.\n\"We wanted the first group of so-called Freedom Summer to be LGBTQ+ and to celebrate our diversity and exercise our freedom \u2026\u00a0since that was taken away from us,\" he told CBC News.\n!\nMembers of Jacksonville's 2SLGBTQ+ community and allies gathered on May 31 to hold their own Pride month bridge lighting, a...[Content truncated]",

But at a certain point the coincidences added up or got too specific, and it wasn\u2019t funny anymore\u2013 it was deeply unsettling.\nAnd by the end? Well, stick with me as the prophecies grow more specific, and you\u2019ll see why my mind was a bit blown\u2013 and why as a Christian my spirit was deeply unsettled by the the end of it:\u00a0\n\nWhen looking to identify the Antichrist, the Bible starts to help us with some really specific prophecies. Based on what the Bible predicts, a most likely scenario for the arrival of the Antichrist would be a candidate for president who came from the private sector (not of \u2018royal\u2019 background) being found with despicable morality along with a contemptuous personality, who campaigned on flattery and lies\u2013 but somehow went on to win an election no one expected him to win\u2026 leaving the country stunned.\n\n\nStarting to get weird now, isn\u2019t it? This is about the point I got goosebumps and a little freaked out also.\nYes, in warning us of the Antichrist the Bible predicts in both Daniel and Revelation that when the Antichrist comes, he\u2019ll not only be the contemptuous and arrogant political outsider who pulls an upset in the election\u2013 but warns us that he\u2019ll specifically be speaking of \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201cgreater\u201d things along the way.\n\nSo, you know\u2026 according to God\u2019s holy and infallible word and all, one of the other major signs to warn us of the arrival of the Antichrist would be an election where someone won with fewer supporters, and where it was also proven that an evil outside power meddled with the process to specifically put that person in office.\nBut I can\u2019t imagine the country would turn a blind eye if that ever happened, especially for my evangelical friends who tell me we need to always be on guard for the arrival of the Antichrist.\n\n\n\nEvil is evil, but evil is not stupid\u2026 or at least, Satan isn\u2019t. When the time comes to make his power move in the human story, he\u2019ll find a way to not only make evil palatable\u2013 he\u2019ll try the ultimate...[Content truncated]",

When Cohen asked who would pay for it, Pecker said he would pay for it himself.\n\u201cThe Boss will be very pleased,\u201d Cohen said, thanking him.\nPecker says that he knew that Cohen had spoken to Trump about this story, because Cohen said that Trump would be willing to take a DNA test to disprove it, which Pecker didn\u2019t think necessary. He says he bought the story for two reasons: (1) he didn\u2019t want Sajudin to shop the story around to other outlets \u201cin the marketplace,\u201d and (2) if true, this story had big potential. \u201cIt would be probably the biggest sale of the National Enquirer since the death of Elvis Presley,\u201d Pecker says, though clarifying that he had planned to wait until after the election to publish it.\nTrump sits with his eyes closed.\nSteinglass displays a series of exhibits, including a source agreement between Pecker and Sajudin for $30,000, payable upon publication, and an exclusivity period of three months. During that time, Sajudin couldn\u2019t take the story elsewhere. An amendment to the agreement, now on screen, changed the payable date to five days after the signing of the amendment, extended the exclusivity period in perpetuity, and added a $1 million liability should Sajudin break the terms.\nPecker mentions that a few things about this agreement were unusual. First, AMI had finished vetting the story, and discovered it was \u201c100 percent false.\u201d But, still wanting to \u201clock it up,\u201d had offered a sum that far exceeded the normal rate, even for a \u201cbigger celebrity.\u201d One million dollars was also an atypically large sum for damages, but Pecker had added it in based on conversations he had with Cohen.

His focus on the brighter parts of humanity often creates a sharp, sometimes confusing dissonance between the genuinely scary stories he weaves and the worldview underpinning them.\nIn the case of allegorical explorations of love and grief, like _Hill House_, this dissonance can pay off wonderfully, because the sharper the horror, the stronger the healing catharsis can be. But in _Midnight Mass_, the precarious balance between horror and hope that characterizes all of Flanagan\u2019s work finally tilted in the wrong direction, at least for me.\nFlanagan  that _Midnight Mass_ is his most personal story yet, based on his own years of religious exploration and \u201ca healthy Catholic upbringing\u201d that was challenged by his personal study of the darker aspects of the Bible, until he ultimately found more affinity with atheism and science. Despite these self-professed doubts, however, there\u2019s very little doubt in _Midnight Mass_. The show\u2019s overtures toward critiquing America\u2019s Christian majority fall by the wayside. Instead, Flanagan and his _Midnight Mass_ co-writer, his sibling , wrap a tale of religious zeal around a barely veiled allegory for the Covid-19 pandemic. Though _Midnight Mass_ was conceived before the pandemic, it was  the pandemic, and inevitably reads as a pandemic-era cautionary tale \u2014 one that\u2019s bolstered by an emphasis on individualized faith. There\u2019s _so_ much effusive Christianity here, so many rapt displays of faith, sermons, monologuing through Bible verses, and preaching to the lost, that the horror elements almost feel like window-dressing.\nEven though _Midnight Mass_ does still contain plenty of overt horror elements, I think the series actually pushes Flanagan quite far outside the horror genre. If anything, I felt baited by this story, which plays within the modern horror sandbox while undercutting much of the ethos of modern horror via its embrace of Christianity as a source of hope and nourishment for lost souls facing an incomprehensible crisis. Many critics have found that to be a good thing,  the series\u2019 emphasis on the less sordid aspects of horror. Yet while Flanagan has every right to keep writing relentlessly hopeful stories, for horror fans like me, the effect of his optimism is frustration over feeling shunned as a non-believer \u2014 by the very genre that usually protects non-believers from feeling shunned.\nThis story is so religious it\u2019s almost insulting\n------------------------------------------------\nAs a queer, genderqueer atheist who was raised as an evangelical, I\u2019m drawn...[Content truncated]",

He moves through life like a man who knows he is always being observed. If all human beings are, by their very nature, social actors, then Donald Trump seems to be more so\u2014superhuman, in this one primal sense.\nMany questions have arisen about Trump during this campaign season\u2014about his platform, his knowledge of issues, his , his level of comfort with political violence. This article touches on some of that. But its central aim is to create a psychological portrait of the man. Who is he, really? How does his mind work? How might he go about making decisions in office, were he to become president? And what does all that suggest about the sort of president he\u2019d be?\n!\nMark Peterson / Redux\nIn creating this portrait, I will draw from well-validated concepts in the fields of personality, developmental, and social psychology. Ever since Sigmund Freud analyzed the life and art of Leonardo da Vinci, in 1910, scholars have applied psychological lenses to the lives of famous people. Many early efforts relied upon untested, nonscientific ideas. In recent years, however, psychologists have increasingly used the tools and concepts of psychological science to shed light on notable lives, as I did in a 2011 book on George W. Bush. A large and rapidly growing body of research shows that people\u2019s temperament, their characteristic motivations and goals, and their internal conceptions of themselves are powerful predictors of what they will feel, think, and do in the future, and powerful aids in explaining why. In the realm of politics, psychologists have recently demonstrated how fundamental features of human personality\u2014such as extroversion and narcissism\u2014shaped the distinctive leadership styles of past U. S. presidents, and the decisions they made. While a range of factors, such as world events and political realities, determine what political leaders can and will do in office, foundational tendencies in human personality, which differ dramatically from one leader to the next, are among them.\nTrump\u2019s personality is certainly extreme by any standard, and particularly rare for a presidential candidate; many people who encounter the man\u2014in negotiations or in interviews or on a debate stage or watching that debate on television\u2014seem to find him flummoxing. In this essay, I will seek to uncover the key dispositions, cognitive styles, motivations, and self-conceptions that together comprise his unique psychological makeup...[Content truncated]",
