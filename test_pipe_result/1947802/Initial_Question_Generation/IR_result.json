Former President Donald Trump’s recent comments on the Constitution and his company’s conviction for tax fraud change the equation, the board argues.\nThanks to our sponsors:\n-----------------------\n---------------------------------------------------\nAld. Gilbert Villegas (36th Ward) sponsored an ordinance in light of the Jan. 6 insurrection last year that would prohibit “any person convicted of treason, sedition or subversive actions from doing business with the city, including having a sign permit.”\n“You have someone that’s notorious, that’s said some crazy things, but he has millions of people that follow him, it’s dangerous,” Villegas said. “We saw what happened on Jan. 6 and now people should be concerned when the former president’s talking about eliminating the Constitution and reinstating himself.”\nVillegas said that he is working closely with Ald. Brendan Reilly (42nd Ward), who represents the area in which the Trump Tower stands, to address issues regarding the city’s business relationships. He also said he is working with his legal team on potentially expanding the ordinance to also include tax fraud.\nJacob Huebert, president of the Chicago-based Liberty Justice Center, said calls...[Content truncated]",

He said Chicago was notorious around the globe for its violence. “It’s embarrassing to us as a nation,” Mr. Trump said. “All over the world, they’re talking about Chicago.”\nIn Chicago, where Mr. Trump won less than 13 percent of the vote in 2016, residents responded with equal contempt, gathering by the thousands outside his curvy skyscraper on the river downtown, where he later attended a private fund-raiser.\n* * *\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

In our married life, we have lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Cairo, Egypt; Quitman, Texas; Durham, North Carolina; Nashville; and Atlanta—all desirable places with much to recommend. We travelled the world. I have spent stretches of my professional life in the places you would expect—New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., all cities that I revere, but not places we chose to settle.\nUnconsciously, during those vagabond years, we were on the lookout for home. I nursed a conception of an ideal community, one that combined qualities I loved about other places: the physical beauty, say, of Atlanta; the joyful music-making of New Orleans; an intellectual scene fed by an important university, as in Cambridge or Durham; a place with a healthy energy and ready access to nature, such as Denver or Seattle; a spot where we could comfortably find friends and safely raise children. I’m not saying that we couldn’t have been happy in any of the places I’ve mentioned, but something kept us from profoundly identifying with them.\nIn 1980, I joined the writing staff of _Texas Monthly_, in Austin. The population then was a little more than three hundred thousand—the current size of Lexington, Kentucky. Thirteen per cent of Austin residents were University of Texas students; another five per cent were faculty and staff. The only other significant presence in town was the state capitol. You could park free on most streets. Of the limited offering of restaurants in town, we favored the Raw Deal, a greasy spoon where, for five bucks, you could choose between the pork chop and the sirloin, accompanied by red beans and Pabst Blue Ribbon. Above the register was the surly admonition “Remember: you came looking for the Raw Deal—the Raw Deal didn’t come looking for you.”\nLife in Austin was offbeat, affordable, spontaneous, blithe, and slyly amused, as if we were in on some hilarious secret the rest of the world was unaware of. Even then, the place had a reputation for being cool, but in my experience it was just extremely relaxed, almost to the point of stupor. There was a reason that the director  titled his 1990 portrait of the city “Slacker.” I was happy to be in Austin for a while: it embodied all the things I still loved about Texas—the friendliness, the vitality, the social mobility—yet it also stood against the mean-spiritedness of the state’s politics, despite being...[Content truncated]",

Former President Donald Trump’s recent comments on the Constitution and his company’s conviction for tax fraud change the equation, the board argues.\nThanks to our sponsors:\n-----------------------\n---------------------------------------------------\nAld. Gilbert Villegas (36th Ward) sponsored an ordinance in light of the Jan. 6 insurrection last year that would prohibit “any person convicted of treason, sedition or subversive actions from doing business with the city, including having a sign permit.”\n“You have someone that’s notorious, that’s said some crazy things, but he has millions of people that follow him, it’s dangerous,” Villegas said. “We saw what happened on Jan. 6 and now people should be concerned when the former president’s talking about eliminating the Constitution and reinstating himself.”\nVillegas said that he is working closely with Ald. Brendan Reilly (42nd Ward), who represents the area in which the Trump Tower stands, to address issues regarding the city’s business relationships. He also said he is working with his legal team on potentially expanding the ordinance to also include tax fraud.\nJacob Huebert, president of the Chicago-based Liberty Justice Center, said calls...[Content truncated]"

For him, it was yet another sign of the state government's disdain for the 2SLGBTQ community.\nJacksonville's Acosta bridge, spanning the St. Johns River, is one of many across the state that are only being lit up in red, white and blue from Memorial Day until Labour Day this year.\nFlorida Department of Transportation Secretary Jared Purdue , to coincide with what Republican Gov.

        "Question": "What evidence shows Trump Tower Chicago residents displayed disdain for Trump through lights?",
        "Answer": "Residents of Trump Tower Chicago have shown their disdain for Donald Trump through various forms of expression, including the use of lights. Although the specific evidence related to lights is not directly outlined in the sources provided, a broader context of dissent from Chicagoans towards Trump can be inferred.\n\n1. **Public Sentiment Against Trump**: In an article detailing the protests that occurred when Trump visited Chicago, residents expressed their strong negative feelings towards him. Many gathered loudly outside the Trump International Hotel & Tower, indicating how strongly they felt about his presence in a city that largely opposed him politically. One resident famously stated that he \"represents everything that Chicago isn’t,\" and her dismissive gesture towards the building highlighted the emotional disdain felt by many towards the Trump brand in Chicago [Query 2_evidence_1].\n\n2. **Calls to Remove the Trump Sign**: In recent discussions surrounding the Trump Tower's iconic sign, the Chicago Tribune editorial board called for its removal, reflecting a shift in public sentiment against Trump following various controversial comments and actions. This outrage signifies a larger movement of residents expressing their dissatisfaction with the Trump brand, which may extend to symbolic gestures such as lighting displays [Query 1_evidence_1]. Although not directly an instance of lights, the call for removal indicates a strong sentiment against Trump that could motivate other forms of dissent.\n\n3. **Symbolism of Lights in Dissent**: Although the evidence provided does not contain a specific example of lights being used by residents of Trump Tower to express disdain for Trump, the act of using lights as a form of protest has been exemplified in various situations. For example, the display of rainbow lights in Jacksonville to symbolize resistance and solidarity against anti-LGBTQ+ policies serves as a parallel to how residents might use lighting displays to express political and social dissent against Trump’s policies and remarks. This suggests that creative light displays could be a plausible avenue for similar political expressions in Chicago, although specific instances need to be verified [Query 1_evidence_2].\n\nIn conclusion, while there is no direct evidence of residents of Trump Tower Chicago utilizing lights specifically to express disdain for Trump, the overall sentiment and historical responses to his visits and the ongoing discourse around the Trump sign indicate a profound dislike. The rationale behind using lights as a protest method is supported by various protest movements, suggesting that such displays of disdain through lights are likely but not confirmed in this case.",
