Former President Donald Trump’s recent comments on the Constitution and his company’s conviction for tax fraud change the equation, the board argues.\nThanks to our sponsors:\n-----------------------\n---------------------------------------------------\nAld. Gilbert Villegas (36th Ward) sponsored an ordinance in light of the Jan. 6 insurrection last year that would prohibit “any person convicted of treason, sedition or subversive actions from doing business with the city, including having a sign permit.”\n“You have someone that’s notorious, that’s said some crazy things, but he has millions of people that follow him, it’s dangerous,” Villegas said. “We saw what happened on Jan. 6 and now people should be concerned when the former president’s talking about eliminating the Constitution and reinstating himself.”\nVillegas said that he is working closely with Ald. Brendan Reilly (42nd Ward), who represents the area in which the Trump Tower stands, to address issues regarding the city’s business relationships.

There, Trump talked about the prosecution’s first witness, David Pecker, the former CEO of National Enquirer publish",

Pecker said it was. Bove brought up a failed attempt by Pecker in 1998 to stop an American Media outlet from publishing a story about Trump paramour Marla Maples.\n“Seventeen years of providing Trump with a heads up about potentially negative publicity,”  Bove said.\nPecker testified for the prosecution, however, that he never paid sources or tipsters in order to kill off stories about Trump until after an August 2015 meeting with Trump where Pecker offered to be the candidate’s “eyes and ears” on the lookout for negative stories. He paid $30,000 to a Trump Tower doorman and $150,000 to a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal. He persuaded Cohen to pay Daniels  — a secret payment that prosecutors have identified as the first act in an illegal effort by Trump to influence the 2016 presidential election.\nPecker testified that although he declined an invitation to Trump’s inauguration in January 2017, he attended a White House dinner that July with his top deputy and editorial fixer, Dylan Howard. Jurors saw a photograph of Howard grinning in the Oval Office, and one of Pecker and President Trump walking together along an outdoor White House corridor, backs to the camera. Pecker testified they were heading to dinner, and on that stroll, Trump asked him, “How is Karen doing?”\nPecker’s testimony will continue today.\nMust Read Stories\n-----------------\nHide Articles\n*   ### \n    !\n*   ### \n    !\n*   ### \n    !\n*   ### \n    !\nMore from this Story Arc\nTrump Hush Money Trial\n----------------------\n*   April 30, 2024\n    ### \n*   April 30, 2024\n    ### \nRead More About:\n----------------\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \nSubscribe to Deadline\n---------------------\nGet our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.\n8 Comments\n----------\nLoading comments...\nSidebar\n-------\n### Trending on Deadline\n*   ]\n*   ]\n...[Content truncated]",

And if he does it again, the judge warned, he could be jailed.\nProsecutors had alleged 10 violations, but New York Judge Juan M. Merchan found there were nine.

It was almost like he wanted to one-up me, to talk about himself.\"\nEventually, she said she \"had enough of his arrogance and cutting me off and not giving me my dinner.\" She testified that she asked him, \"Are you always this rude, arrogant and pompous?\" and said, \"Someone should spank you.\"\nTrump gave her a magazine, Daniels testified. \"I don't think he thought I would do it,\" she said. \"So, I took it from him and said, 'Turn around,' and I swatted him … right on the butt.\"\nThe conversation turned to \"The Apprentice,\" Daniels remembered. Trump told her that she should be a contestant, to which she replied: \"There's no way that NBC would ever allow an adult actress on television.\"\n\"He said, 'You remind me of my daughter because she's smart and blond and beautiful and people underestimate her as well,'\" Daniels said.

The defiant display captured international attention, and advocates say it's a symbol of how people are fighting back against anti-2SLGBTQ+ policies.\nThe 'tide is turning' in the state but advocates warn 2SLGBTQ+ rights should be top of mind in election year\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n!\nResidents of Jacksonville, Fla., lit up one of the city's bridges with rainbow lights to mark the beginning of Pride month after the state declared that only red, white and blue light displays would be permitted this summer. The rainbow move captured international attention, and advocates say it shows how people are fighting back against anti-2SLGBTQ+ policies. (Keith Holden)\nMatt McAllister was dismayed to learn that there would be no display of rainbow lights illuminating the bridge in his home of Jacksonville, Fla., for Pride month this year. For him, it was yet another sign of the state government's disdain for the 2SLGBTQ community.\nJacksonville's Acosta bridge, spanning the St. Johns River, is one of many across the state that are only being lit up in red, white and blue from Memorial Day until Labour Day this year.\nFlorida Department of Transportation Secretary Jared Purdue , to coincide with what Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis declared  — a tax holiday for some recreational activities and supplies — effectively barring all other illuminations for celebrations like Pride month, which began on June 1.\n*   \n*   \nRather than getting angry, McAllister got creative. On the eve of Pride month, he helped organize a rainbow rebellion of sorts, to create a colourful light display across another nearby bridge in a show of support, solidarity and celebration of the 2SLGBTQ+ community.\n\"We wanted the first group of so-called Freedom Summer to be LGBTQ+ and to celebrate our diversity and exercise our freedom … since that was taken away from us,\" he told CBC News.\n!\nMembers of Jacksonville's 2SLGBTQ+ community and allies gathered on May 31 to hold their own Pride month bridge lighting, a...[Content truncated]",

But at a certain point the coincidences added up or got too specific, and it wasn’t funny anymore– it was deeply unsettling.\nAnd by the end? Well, stick with me as the prophecies grow more specific, and you’ll see why my mind was a bit blown– and why as a Christian my spirit was deeply unsettled by the the end of it: \n\nWhen looking to identify the Antichrist, the Bible starts to help us with some really specific prophecies. Based on what the Bible predicts, a most likely scenario for the arrival of the Antichrist would be a candidate for president who came from the private sector (not of ‘royal’ background) being found with despicable morality along with a contemptuous personality, who campaigned on flattery and lies– but somehow went on to win an election no one expected him to win… leaving the country stunned.\n\n\nStarting to get weird now, isn’t it? This is about the point I got goosebumps and a little freaked out also.\nYes, in warning us of the Antichrist the Bible predicts in both Daniel and Revelation that when the Antichrist comes, he’ll not only be the contemptuous and arrogant political outsider who pulls an upset in the election– but warns us that he’ll specifically be speaking of “great” and “greater” things along the way.\n\nSo, you know… according to God’s holy and infallible word and all, one of the other major signs to warn us of the arrival of the Antichrist would be an election where someone won with fewer supporters, and where it was also proven that an evil outside power meddled with the process to specifically put that person in office.\nBut I can’t imagine the country would turn a blind eye if that ever happened, especially for my evangelical friends who tell me we need to always be on guard for the arrival of the Antichrist.\n\n\n\nEvil is evil, but evil is not stupid… or at least, Satan isn’t. When the time comes to make his power move in the human story, he’ll find a way to not only make evil palatable– he’ll try the ultimate...[Content truncated]",

Though Cohen said it was “absolutely not true,” he’d check it out.\nPecker clarifies that he had notified Cohen about Sajudin’s story as part of the agreement in the August 2015 meeting.\nCohen called Pecker back to tell him he verified the two names were on payroll and asked Pecker to vet the story, who called Cohen back after he did and told him that the National Enquirer would have to “go forward with the story.” Pecker negotiated a price of $30,000 with the source, Sajudin, for exclusivity. When Cohen asked who would pay for it, Pecker said he would pay for it himself.\n“The Boss will be very pleased,” Cohen said, thanking him.\nPecker says that he knew that Cohen had spoken to Trump about this story, because Cohen said that Trump would be willing to take a DNA test to disprove it, which Pecker didn’t think necessary. He says he bought the story for two reasons: (1) he didn’t want Sajudin to shop the story around to other outlets “in the marketplace,” and (2) if true, this story had big potential. “It would be probably the biggest sale of the National Enquirer since the death of Elvis Presley,” Pecker says, though clarifying that he had planned to wait until after the election to publish it.\nTrump sits with his eyes closed.\nSteinglass displays a series of exhibits, including a source agreement between Pecker and Sajudin for $30,000, payable upon publication, and an exclusivity period of three months. During that time, Sajudin couldn’t take the story elsewhere. An amendment to the agreement, now on screen, changed the payable date to five days after the signing of the amendment, extended the exclusivity period in perpetuity, and added a $1 million liability should Sajudin break the terms.\nPecker mentions that a few things about this agreement were unusual. First, AMI had finished vetting the story, and discovered it was “100 percent false.” But, still wanting to “lock it up,” had offered a sum that far exceeded the normal rate, even for a “bigger celebrity.” One million dollars was also an atypically large sum for damages, but Pecker had added it in based on conversations he had with Cohen.

His focus on the brighter parts of humanity often creates a sharp, sometimes confusing dissonance between the genuinely scary stories he weaves and the worldview underpinning them.\nIn the case of allegorical explorations of love and grief, like _Hill House_, this dissonance can pay off wonderfully, because the sharper the horror, the stronger the healing catharsis can be. But in _Midnight Mass_, the precarious balance between horror and hope that characterizes all of Flanagan’s work finally tilted in the wrong direction, at least for me.\nFlanagan  that _Midnight Mass_ is his most personal story yet, based on his own years of religious exploration and “a healthy Catholic upbringing” that was challenged by his personal study of the darker aspects of the Bible, until he ultimately found more affinity with atheism and science. Despite these self-professed doubts, however, there’s very little doubt in _Midnight Mass_. The show’s overtures toward critiquing America’s Christian majority fall by the wayside. Instead, Flanagan and his _Midnight Mass_ co-writer, his sibling , wrap a tale of religious zeal around a barely veiled allegory for the Covid-19 pandemic. Though _Midnight Mass_ was conceived before the pandemic, it was  the pandemic, and inevitably reads as a pandemic-era cautionary tale — one that’s bolstered by an emphasis on individualized faith. There’s _so_ much effusive Christianity here, so many rapt displays of faith, sermons, monologuing through Bible verses, and preaching to the lost, that the horror elements almost feel like window-dressing.\nEven though _Midnight Mass_ does still contain plenty of overt horror elements, I think the series actually pushes Flanagan quite far outside the horror genre. If anything, I felt baited by this story, which plays within the modern horror sandbox while undercutting much of the ethos of modern horror via its embrace of Christianity as a source of hope and nourishment for lost souls facing an incomprehensible crisis. Many critics have found that to be a good thing,  the series’ emphasis on the less sordid aspects of horror. Yet while Flanagan has every right to keep writing relentlessly hopeful stories, for horror fans like me, the effect of his optimism is frustration over feeling shunned as a non-believer — by the very genre that usually protects non-believers from feeling shunned.\nThis story is so religious it’s almost insulting\n------------------------------------------------\nAs a queer, genderqueer atheist who was raised as an evangelical, I’m drawn...[Content truncated]",

He moves through life like a man who knows he is always being observed. If all human beings are, by their very nature, social actors, then Donald Trump seems to be more so—superhuman, in this one primal sense.\nMany questions have arisen about Trump during this campaign season—about his platform, his knowledge of issues, his , his level of comfort with political violence. This article touches on some of that. But its central aim is to create a psychological portrait of the man. Who is he, really? How does his mind work? How might he go about making decisions in office, were he to become president? And what does all that suggest about the sort of president he’d be?\n!\nMark Peterson / Redux\nIn creating this portrait, I will draw from well-validated concepts in the fields of personality, developmental, and social psychology. Ever since Sigmund Freud analyzed the life and art of Leonardo da Vinci, in 1910, scholars have applied psychological lenses to the lives of famous people. Many early efforts relied upon untested, nonscientific ideas. In recent years, however, psychologists have increasingly used the tools and concepts of psychological science to shed light on notable lives, as I did in a 2011 book on George W. Bush. A large and rapidly growing body of research shows that people’s temperament, their characteristic motivations and goals, and their internal conceptions of themselves are powerful predictors of what they will feel, think, and do in the future, and powerful aids in explaining why. In the realm of politics, psychologists have recently demonstrated how fundamental features of human personality—such as extroversion and narcissism—shaped the distinctive leadership styles of past U. S. presidents, and the decisions they made. While a range of factors, such as world events and political realities, determine what political leaders can and will do in office, foundational tendencies in human personality, which differ dramatically from one leader to the next, are among them.\nTrump’s personality is certainly extreme by any standard, and particularly rare for a presidential candidate; many people who encounter the man—in negotiations or in interviews or on a debate stage or watching that debate on television—seem to find him flummoxing. In this essay, I will seek to uncover the key dispositions, cognitive styles, motivations, and self-conceptions that together comprise his unique psychological makeup...[Content truncated]",
