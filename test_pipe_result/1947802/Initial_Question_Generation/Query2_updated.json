In our married life, we have lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Cairo, Egypt; Quitman, Texas; Durham, North Carolina; Nashville; and Atlanta\u2014all desirable places with much to recommend. We travelled the world. I have spent stretches of my professional life in the places you would expect\u2014New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., all cities that I revere, but not places we chose to settle.\nUnconsciously, during those vagabond years, we were on the lookout for home. I nursed a conception of an ideal community, one that combined qualities I loved about other places: the physical beauty, say, of Atlanta; the joyful music-making of New Orleans; an intellectual scene fed by an important university, as in Cambridge or Durham; a place with a healthy energy and ready access to nature, such as Denver or Seattle; a spot where we could comfortably find friends and safely raise children. I\u2019m not saying that we couldn\u2019t have been happy in any of the places I\u2019ve mentioned, but something kept us from profoundly identifying with them.\nIn 1980, I joined the writing staff of _Texas Monthly_, in Austin. The population then was a little more than three hundred thousand\u2014the current size of Lexington, Kentucky. Thirteen per cent of Austin residents were University of Texas students; another five per cent were faculty and staff. The only other significant presence in town was the state capitol. You could park free on most streets. Of the limited offering of restaurants in town, we favored the Raw Deal, a greasy spoon where, for five bucks, you could choose between the pork chop and the sirloin, accompanied by red beans and Pabst Blue Ribbon. Above the register was the surly admonition \u201cRemember: you came looking for the Raw Deal\u2014the Raw Deal didn\u2019t come looking for you.\u201d\nLife in Austin was offbeat, affordable, spontaneous, blithe, and slyly amused, as if we were in on some hilarious secret the rest of the world was unaware of. Even then, the place had a reputation for being cool, but in my experience it was just extremely relaxed, almost to the point of stupor. There was a reason that the director  titled his 1990 portrait of the city \u201cSlacker.\u201d I was happy to be in Austin for a while: it embodied all the things I still loved about Texas\u2014the friendliness, the vitality, the social mobility\u2014yet it also stood against the mean-spiritedness of the state\u2019s politics, despite being...[Content truncated]",

He said Chicago was notorious around the globe for its violence. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to us as a nation,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAll over the world, they\u2019re talking about Chicago.\u201d\nIn Chicago, where Mr. Trump won less than 13 percent of the vote in 2016, residents responded with equal contempt, gathering by the thousands outside his curvy skyscraper on the river downtown, where he later attended a private fund-raiser.\n* * *\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Law enforcement officials say Beal\u00a0pointed a gun\u00a0before he was fatally shot.\nThanks to our sponsors:\n-----------------------\n---------------------------------------------------\nSeveral protests have taken place in Mount Greenwood since the shooting. Some residents of the predominantly white South Side neighborhood have gathered to oppose the protests and express support for the Chicago Police Department.\nOn Sunday, protesters were again met by Mount Greenwood residents. One counter-protester held a sign reading \u201cBlack Crime Matters\u201d; another drowned out chants by sounding an alarm.\n* * *\nDespite the apparent divisions, some activists and residents have been making efforts to unite and better understand each other.\u00a0\u00a0between the groups have already taken place.\nJoining Carol Marin to discuss the protests and efforts to unite are\u00a0, an activist on the front lines of protests in Mount Greenwood; Chicago Police Department area coordinator Glen Brooks; and Mike Brown, a former south suburban Illinois police officer and the owner of a security training agency in Chicago.\n_Follow Evan Garcia on Twitter:\u00a0_\n* * *\n**_Related stories:_**\n**Marist High School Cancels Classes Amid Concerns of Mount Greenwood Protests**]\n_Nov. 11:_ School officials cited student safety concerns in canceling classes Friday after the local Black Lives Matter chapter had scheduled a protest nearby.\n* * *\n**Tensions High After Fatal Weekend Shooting in Mount Greenwood**]\n_Nov. 7:_ WBEZ reporter Shannon He...[Content truncated]",
