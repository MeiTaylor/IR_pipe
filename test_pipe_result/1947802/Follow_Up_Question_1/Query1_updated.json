The floor to ceiling walls consisting of dark black glass dually asserts a machismo tone while also making it visually impossible to clearly distinguish the faces of its inhabitants. Any bustle of tourists, taxis, or tumult from the outside streets of New York are replaced with a pin drop silence. There are no families bustling around with groceries from Fairway or giggling teenagers in their Everlane athleisure ensembles. There are no elderly men in berets and Burberry trench coats taking their dachshunds for an evening walk or children dribbling basketballs in the lobby. There is merely an occasional foreign businessman, who may or may not be laundering offshore money through Egon Schiele paintings, gliding through the lobby wearing dark sunglasses and an Eastern European model on his arm.\nThe residents of Trump Towers are residents for the discretion the building affords. This isn\u2019t the sort of discretion factored into the pre-war buildings of the Upper East Side or the modern colossals tucked away in Hudson Yards or Billionaire\u2019s Row. At the foundation of Trump Towers is a loyal staff of doormen, elevator men, and concierge cloaked in black suits, white gloves and postal boy hats, whose sole purpose is to ensure their residents\u2019 personal and/or professional affairs are kept under the radar. It is the staff that facilitates a domicile where its residents can anonymously exist within the literal shadows of its deep mauve colored carpet lined hallways.\nMy Midwestern father, the son of Turkish immigrants, didn\u2019t fit into the customary category of Trump Tower residents. His parents, former manufacturing workers in a Goodyear Tire plant, saved enough money to humbly invest in his growing real estate business. This investment gave him leverage to elevate into the ranks of the growing upper middle class of the early nineties. The economy was booming under Bill Clinton, so much so that someone like my father could make buying an apartment in New York a reality. It didn\u2019t matter that he wasn\u2019t a Wall Street trader or foreign raconteur. What mattered to him was the dream an apartment in a building like Trump Towers represented. He too, could be a part of the financial elite who played the markets and ate Chilean Sea Bass in Southampton on a Saturday in August. He was a part of the other America who were in quest of something else. He didn\u2019t want the wholesome quiet suburban home with the white picket fence and a yellow Labrador retriever.

A separate building nearby won a judge's permission to remove Trump's name if enough residents agree.\nUpdated at 12:29 p.m. ET Thursday\nA judge in New York has ruled that residents of Trump Place, a condominium building on Manhattan's West Side, have the right to remove President Trump's name from the building if enough of them approve of it.\nThe ruling by New York Supreme Court Judge Eileen Bransten marks a defeat for the Trump Organization, which had argued that removing the name would violate the building's licensing agreement.\nThe company has had to contend with a growing number of commercial and residential buildings, including several outside the country, that want to remove Trump's name.\nIn New York, several other apartment buildings along the Hudson River have taken the same step. The Trump Soho, a condo hotel opened with great fanfare a decade ago, has been rechristened the Dominick.\nTrump Place has not definitely said it will change its name, but wanted the judge to determine that it had the right to do so. Most of those who voted in a straw poll said they favored changing the name.\nAfter Thursday's ruling, Harry Lipman, the attorney for the building, would not say whether the building's condominium board would now proceed with a vote, but did say of the ruling, \"We're pleased, obviously.\"\nThe building is not owned by Trump, but is managed by the Trump Organization.\nElizabeth Holub, who owns an apartment there, says she has no complaints about the way the building, which has a highly desirable view of the Hudson River, is run.\n\"The reality is, it's the best-run building. It's unbelievable. Every member of the staff. There's no better place in the world to raise a family,\" Holub says.\nStill, she wishes it were named something other than Trump.\n\"Look, I can't stand Donald Trump.

Here\u2019s what I learned about happiness and the wintertime blues.\n!\nKari Leibowitz\nLocated more than 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle, Troms\u00f8, Norway, is home to extreme light variation between seasons. During the Polar Night, which lasts from November to January, the sun doesn\u2019t rise at all. Then the days get progressively longer until the Midnight Sun period, from May to July, when it never sets. After the midnight sun, the days get shorter and shorter again until the Polar Night, and the yearly cycle repeats.\nSo, perhaps understandably, many people had a hard time relating when I told them I was moving there.\n\u201cI could never live there,\u201d was the most common response I heard. \u201cThat winter would make me so depressed,\u201d many added, or \u201cI just get so tired when it\u2019s dark out.\u201d\nBut the Polar Night was what drew me to Troms\u00f8 in the first place.\nDespite the city\u2019s extreme darkness,   has shown that residents of Troms\u00f8 have lower rates of wintertime depression than would be expected given the long winters and high latitude. In fact, the prevalence of self-reported depression during the winter in Troms\u00f8, with its latitude of 69\u00b0N, is the same as that of Montgomery County, Maryland, at 41\u00b0N. While there is some debate among psychologists about the best way to identify and diagnose wintertime depression, one thing seems clear: Residents of northern Norway seem able to avoid much of the wintertime suffering experienced elsewhere\u2014including, paradoxically, in warmer, brighter, more southern locations.\nI first learned of Troms\u00f8 two years ago, as a recent college graduate looking for more research experience before applying to graduate school for social psychology. In search of an opportunity that would allow me to explore my interests in positive psychology and mental health\u2014and satisfy my sense of adventure\u2014I stumbled upon the work of Joar Vitters\u00f8, a psychologist at the University of Troms\u00f8 who studies happiness, personal growth, and quality of life.\nAfter reaching out to him via email, I learned that the University of Troms\u00f8 is the northernmost university in the world...[Content truncated]",

A 33-year-old nurse who was living at the Y.W.C.A. in Harlem, she had come to rent a one-bedroom at the still-unfinished Wilshire Apartments in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens. She filled out what the rental agent remembers as a \u201cbeautiful application.\u201d She did not even want to look at the unit.\nThere was just one hitch: Maxine Brown was black.\nStanley Leibowitz, the rental agent, talked to his boss, Fred C. Trump.\n\u201cI asked him what to do and he says, \u2018Take the application and put it in a drawer and leave it there,\u2019\u201d Mr. Leibowitz, now 88, recalled in an interview.\nIt was late 1963 \u2014 just months before President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the landmark Civil Rights Act \u2014 and the tall, mustachioed Fred Trump was approaching the apex of his building career. He was about to complete the jewel in the crown of his middle-class housing empire: seven 23-story towers, called Trump Village, spread across nearly 40 acres in Coney Island.\nHe was also grooming his heir. His son Donald, 17, would soon enroll at Fordham University in the Bronx, living at his parents\u2019 home in Queens and spending much of his free time touring construction sites in his father\u2019s Cadillac, driven by a black chauffeur.\n\u201cHis father was his idol,\u201d Mr. Leibowitz recalled. \u201cAnytime he would come into the building, Donald would be by his side.\u201d\nIn a 1973 court filing, Donald Trump denied allegations by the government that Trump Management had engaged in racial bias in its renting of apartments.

Trump bought a 14-story building on prime real estate facing New York City's Central Park. \n His plan was to tear down the building and replace it with luxury condos. But first he needed a small band of rent-stabilized tenants out of there. \n To succeed, Trump played rough, according to lawsuits filed by the tenants. Renters said he cut heat and hot water, and he imposed tough building rules. Trump even proposed sheltering homeless people in the building. \n It went on for five years as Trump fought tenants, real estate lawyers, New York state regulators and city officials. \n CNNMoney reviewed 2,895 court documents -- most of them now only available on microfiche at New York state courts -- that detail a fight that's now largely forgotten. \n \n Leaks, rats and bitter cold \n By 1981, Trump was already the epitome of American business bravado. At 35 years old, he had cut historic multi-million dollar land deals, saved a blighted midtown Manhattan subway hub, and was in the process of erecting the black-framed glass behemoth of Trump Tower. \n The next move in his real life game of Monopoly came in July 1981, when he bought a hotel and its neighbor, a rent-stabilized building at 100 Central Park South. \n Two months later, he applied for a demolition permit to blow it up. Trump fired the building manager and replaced him with Citadel Management. In his book, The Art of the Deal, Trump himself said he chose a company that \"specialized in relocating tenants.\" \n Just a few months later, on New Year's Eve, several tenants received identical \"lease violation\" warning letters. The previous building owner had given renters permission to knock down walls and renovate their apartment units. But Trump was reversing that exception, and renters had only 12 days to rebuild the walls -- or face eviction. \n The renters hired a real estate lawyer known in New York City for being particularly aggressive. They sued Trump and his company, Park South Associates. CNNMoney identified at least two instances in which New York state judges stepped in to put Trump's lease violation notices on hold. \n \n In their 1982 lawsuits, the tenants said Trump had cut off their hot water and heat during New York's freezing winters and stopped all building repairs. One claimed he allowed \"a rodent infestation of the premises.\"...[Content truncated]",

He also claimed: \u201cThe apartments will bring in $268 million, all profit.\u201d\nResidential sales under scrutiny\n--------------------------------\n!\nYet, according to official property deeds, this was seemingly untrue. _Forbes_ reports that around 60% of the units\u2060 \u2013 one pictured here\u2060 \u2013 sold in the year the tower opened. The most expensive apartment in the building sold\u00a0for $2 million (\u00a31.6m), much less than the $12 million (\u00a39.5m) Trump claimed, and the cheapest for just $130,000 (\u00a3103k). By the end of the building\u2019s first year in business, it reportedly had a turnover of some $45 million (\u00a335.6m). It was certainly not enough to pay back the $130 million (\u00a3103m) loan on the building and was a far cry from the nine-figure profit Trump had touted. But the building still went on to turn over a healthy sum, in large part due to its retail and office spaces.\nCommercial square footage inflated?\n-----------------------------------\n!\nMichael Brennan / Getty Images\nAllegations that Trump exaggerated the size of his penthouse in the tower are key to Letitia James\u2019 fraud lawsuit, and now\u00a0_Forbes_\u00a0claims that the size of the tower\u2019s commercial space is up for question too. In one instance, a statement from the Trump Organization says that the\u00a0retail space measures 114,000 square feet, while another document lists the square footage as 46,000. Filed in 1983, the condo declaration for Trump Tower indicates that the total rentable commercial square footage of the building is 182,000. Yet the expos\u00e9 says that an official filing describes the rentable space as 257,000 square feet, and records connected to a loan put it at 215,000.

Cleveland did all three in the area around Public Square.\nFormer mayor Frank Jackson, who served from 2006 to 2022, says that when he entered office, \u201cyou could roll a bowling ball downtown after work and you wouldn\u2019t hit anybody. It was a ghost town.\u201d Cleveland epitomized the Rust Belt; businesses were leaving, and people were fleeing. Initial attempts at revival focused on a new convention center, spruced-up sports stadiums and a downtown casino. But something was missing: a great public space for everyone to gather.\nThe push to renovate Public Square began in 2011. Anthony Coyne, a lawyer who chaired the city\u2019s Group Plan Commission, kept handy a PowerPoint deck with a vision for a square as vibrant \u2014 and green \u2014 as New York City\u2019s Bryant Park or Chicago\u2019s Millennium Park. He showed it to any business executive, civic leader and philanthropist who would listen.\nThe square started off in the 1800s as a pasture for animals. By the early 20th century, it had become a bustling shopping center. Many remember visiting department stores there such as Higbee\u2019s and the May. By the late 20th century, high-rise office towers had taken over. The city put two big roads through Public Square that chopped the park into four tiny quadrants. The overarching goal was to make it easier for workers to commute from the suburbs. It typified what so many American downtowns had become in the previous 40 years: functional but sterile.\nWhen Cleveland won the bid to host the 2016 Republican National Convention, the city rushed to show a rejuvenated face to the world. It completed a $50 million renovation of Public Square, partly funded by donations. The result was a well-lit park that removed most traffic lanes. Half the square is devoted to a big, grassy area with many trees and benches. The other side of the square has a cafe, a Civil War monument and an ice rink (which turns into a splash pad in the summer).\nThe makeover had an immediate impact. Families brought kids to play in the water park. Office workers and students came to sit on benches and grab lunch at REBoL, an organic eatery on the square. Rallies and festivals such as Pride in CLE filled the square. And real estate developers began to buy the surrounding (mostly vacant) office buildings with a plan to turn them into rental apartments.\nThe Standard, a former union headquarters, was turned...[Content truncated]",
