Sanchez / Chicago Tribune\n1 of 9\nProtesters march in the Loop during a rally for the impeachment of President Donald Trump on Dec. 17, 2019, in Chicago.\n!!!\nBy ,  and \nUPDATED: December 18, 2019 at 12:43 p.m.\nProtesters filled Federal Plaza in Chicago, rallied in downtown Naperville and clashed with pro-Trump demonstrators in south suburban Frankfort on a frigid Tuesday night to demonstrate ahead of a historic vote for the impeachment of President Donald Trump.\n, the rally at Federal Plaza, one of many taking place across the country, kicked off about 5:30 p.m. with holiday-themed messages. The crowd held up signs with sayings like “Treasons Greetings” and “Santas for Impeachment” as temperatures dipped below the 30s and the wind began to bite.\nSpeakers at the plaza included Renato Mariotti, a former attorney general candidate and CNN legal analyst, Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson and Indivisible Chicago Executive Director Darcey Regan.\n“In this moment, we have a situation where our president is corrupt, where there are abuses of power in our Constitution, and you are all making a statement by being out here today,” Mariotti said. “You’re out here in the cold. In this historical moment, this is where you stand. You stand for the Constitution. You stand for the principle that no one is above the law.”\n!\nA protester holds a “criminal-in-chief” sign while dressed as President Donald Trump during a rally for Trump’s impeachment in Federal Plaza in Chicago on Dec. 17, 2019.\nSusan Lawrence, of Andersonville, stood with her sparkling protest poster, with lights held in place by American flag duct tape. Lawrence said she made “a worthwhile sacrifice” of some of her holiday decorations. If there are more protests, Lawrence said she plans to keep showing up.\n“I am just an American who has grown so angry by everything that’s happening and feeling so disempowered,” Lawrence said. “It...[Content truncated]",

Their protests were matched by similar outbursts across major cities.\nCatherine Sneed, a resident of Logan Square, came out to protest, holding up a sign saying, “I feel personally kicked in the pussy.” She referred to a video that captured Trump using lewd terms to describe his actions towards women.\nWatching the election results come in the night before, Sneed recalled feeling as if it was a “surreal” event.\n“We literary elected a bully and put him in office,” said Sneed. “And I think that’s terrible. That reflects badly on us.”\nSneed said she’s worried for her friends of various sexual orientations and of different faiths. She’s also concerned about Trump’s comments about women throughout the campaign.\n“As a woman, I am always...[Content truncated]",

Racine Ave. Admission is free, but tickets are required.\nSoon after DNAinfo Chicago first reported the location, a Facebook event popped up, hosted by \"Stop Trump 2016- Chicago,\" for a protest to begin at 3 p.m before the rally's doors open. As of Monday morning, 7,800 people RSVP'd for the event and another 14,000 expressed interest in the \"peaceful\" protest. \nTrump told Sun-Times columnist Michael Sneed he was excited about the visit: “I’m planning to give a speech and stay at my world-famous hotel, the Trump Tower.\n“I love Chicago. I love Mike Ditka. I love my hotel ... the Trump Tower, which is No 1. We are No 1. No. 1. And how about my polls. Amazing, huh?”\nWhile there's no doubt Trump is No. 1 in GOP polls, his hotel is actually No. 5 in Chicago, according to a U.S. News and World Report ranking. The Langham at 330 N. Wabash Ave. is No. 1.\nHis Ditka love might have something to do with Da Coach telling a New York radio station Thursday that at this point, he plans to vote for the billionaire businessman.\nTwo hours after news of the rally broke, a petition on MoveOn.org to keep Trump out of UIC had been created and garnered more than 300 signatures. The anti-Trump protest already had 1,600 RSVPs as of 7 p.m. The organizers of the Facebook protest are encouraging people to sign up for free tickets to the Trump rally to keep the tickets out of hands of Trump supporters.\nAt least one alderman has...[Content truncated]",
