A separate building nearby won a judge's permission to remove Trump's name if enough residents agree.\nUpdated at 12:29 p.m. ET Thursday\nA judge in New York has ruled that residents of Trump Place, a condominium building on Manhattan's West Side, have the right to remove President Trump's name from the building if enough of them approve of it.\nThe ruling by New York Supreme Court Judge Eileen Bransten marks a defeat for the Trump Organization, which had argued that removing the name would violate the building's licensing agreement.\nThe company has had to contend with a growing number of commercial and residential buildings, including several outside the country, that want to remove Trump's name.\nIn New York, several other apartment buildings along the Hudson River have taken the same step. The Trump Soho, a condo hotel opened with great fanfare a decade ago, has been rechristened the Dominick.\nTrump Place has not definitely said it will change its name, but wanted the judge to determine that it had the right to do so. Most of those who voted in a straw poll said they favored changing the name.\nAfter Thursday's ruling, Harry Lipman, the attorney for the building, would not say whether the building's condominium board would now proceed with a vote, but did say of the ruling, \"We're pleased, obviously.\"\nThe building is not owned by Trump, but is managed by the Trump Organization.\nElizabeth Holub, who owns an apartment there, says she has no complaints about the way the building, which has a highly desirable view of the Hudson River, is run.\n\"The reality is, it's the best-run building. It's unbelievable. Every member of the staff. There's no better place in the world to raise a family,\" Holub says.\nStill, she wishes it were named something other than Trump.\n\"Look, I can't stand Donald Trump.

Cleveland did all three in the area around Public Square.\nFormer mayor Frank Jackson, who served from 2006 to 2022, says that when he entered office, “you could roll a bowling ball downtown after work and you wouldn’t hit anybody. It was a ghost town.” Cleveland epitomized the Rust Belt; businesses were leaving, and people were fleeing. Initial attempts at revival focused on a new convention center, spruced-up sports stadiums and a downtown casino. But something was missing: a great public space for everyone to gather.\nThe push to renovate Public Square began in 2011. Anthony Coyne, a lawyer who chaired the city’s Group Plan Commission, kept handy a PowerPoint deck with a vision for a square as vibrant — and green — as New York City’s Bryant Park or Chicago’s Millennium Park. He showed it to any business executive, civic leader and philanthropist who would listen.\nThe square started off in the 1800s as a pasture for animals. By the early 20th century, it had become a bustling shopping center. Many remember visiting department stores there such as Higbee’s and the May. By the late 20th century, high-rise office towers had taken over. The city put two big roads through Public Square that chopped the park into four tiny quadrants. The overarching goal was to make it easier for workers to commute from the suburbs. It typified what so many American downtowns had become in the previous 40 years: functional but sterile.\nWhen Cleveland won the bid to host the 2016 Republican National Convention, the city rushed to show a rejuvenated face to the world. It completed a $50 million renovation of Public Square, partly funded by donations. The result was a well-lit park that removed most traffic lanes. Half the square is devoted to a big, grassy area with many trees and benches. The other side of the square has a cafe, a Civil War monument and an ice rink (which turns into a splash pad in the summer).\nThe makeover had an immediate impact. Families brought kids to play in the water park. Office workers and students came to sit on benches and grab lunch at REBoL, an organic eatery on the square. Rallies and festivals such as Pride in CLE filled the square. And real estate developers began to buy the surrounding (mostly vacant) office buildings with a plan to turn them into rental apartments.\nThe Standard, a former union headquarters, was turned...[Content truncated]",

A 33-year-old nurse who was living at the Y.W.C.A. in Harlem, she had come to rent a one-bedroom at the still-unfinished Wilshire Apartments in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens. She filled out what the rental agent remembers as a “beautiful application.” She did not even want to look at the unit.\nThere was just one hitch: Maxine Brown was black.\nStanley Leibowitz, the rental agent, talked to his boss, Fred C. Trump.\n“I asked him what to do and he says, ‘Take the application and put it in a drawer and leave it there,’” Mr. Leibowitz, now 88, recalled in an interview.\nIt was late 1963 — just months before President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the landmark Civil Rights Act — and the tall, mustachioed Fred Trump was approaching the apex of his building career. He was about to complete the jewel in the crown of his middle-class housing empire: seven 23-story towers, called Trump Village, spread across nearly 40 acres in Coney Island.\nHe was also grooming his heir. His son Donald, 17, would soon enroll at Fordham University in the Bronx, living at his parents’ home in Queens and spending much of his free time touring construction sites in his father’s Cadillac, driven by a black chauffeur.\n“His father was his idol,” Mr. Leibowitz recalled. “Anytime he would come into the building, Donald would be by his side.”\nIn a 1973 court filing, Donald Trump denied allegations by the government that Trump Management had engaged in racial bias in its renting of apartments.

        "Question": "What specific instances or reports detail the light displays used by Trump Tower residents to express disdain for Trump?",
        "Answer": "Residents of Trump Tower in Chicago have shown their disdain for Donald Trump, but specific instances or reports of light displays specifically used by them are not well-documented. However, there are a few relevant pieces of evidence that suggest some residents have utilized creative forms of protest, including the use of lights or decorations in their expressions of dissatisfaction. 1. **Use of Lights in Protest**: During a rally on December 17, 2019, against Trump’s impeachment, a protester named Susan Lawrence held up a sparkling protest poster with lights held in place by American flag duct tape. She indicated that she repurposed some of her holiday decorations for the protest, showcasing a direct connection between the use of lights as a form of dissent against Trump. 2. **General Climate of Protest**: Following the election of Donald Trump, many protests occurred in Chicago, including gatherings around Trump Tower where residents expressed their opposition. While specific reports predominantly reflect the usage of signs and chants, the overall atmosphere of these protests indicates that residents were considering various forms of symbolic protest against Trump and his policies. 3. **Symbolism of Protest Displays**: The broader context of protests in Chicago includes various symbolic gestures, such as the collective use of signs and thematic attire by protesters. These acts often incorporate visual elements, including lights, as seen in the aforementioned December 2019 rally, suggesting that while not exhaustive, there is a cultural precedence for using lights to symbolize dissent. In conclusion, while there are anecdotal mentions of light displays in protest, particularly in the context of the December 2019 rally, specific instances detailing organized light displays by Trump Tower residents as a method of expressing disdain for Trump remain limited and not comprehensively documented.",
