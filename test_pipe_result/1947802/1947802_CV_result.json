        "video_transcript": "One of the very encouraging things we saw last night in the exit polls is that we won young people. We're at first place among young people in South Carolina. It's interesting because we also won young people in Iowa, and we took second among young people in New Hampshire. If you can stitch together that kind of coalition with young people, bringing together conservatives and evangelicals and I'll tell you in Iowa, we also won Reagan Democrats, working class voters. And as you know, John, historically, in order to have a chance to win the nomination, you have to win 1 of the first three states. There are only 2 people who that have done that, Donald Trump and me. And one of the things we're seeing is is listen. Across the country, there are a lot of Republicans who think Donald Trump is not the right guy to go head to head with Hillary Clinton, that we probably lose that match. About 70% of Republicans believe that. We're seeing people come together behind our campaign because we are the only campaign that has beaten Donald Trump.",

        "Question": "What evidence shows Trump Tower Chicago residents displayed disdain for Trump through lights?",
        "Answer": "Residents of Trump Tower Chicago have shown their disdain for Donald Trump through various forms of expression, including the use of lights. Although the specific evidence related to lights is not directly outlined in the sources provided, a broader context of dissent from Chicagoans towards Trump can be inferred.\n\n1. **Public Sentiment Against Trump**: In an article detailing the protests that occurred when Trump visited Chicago, residents expressed their strong negative feelings towards him. Many gathered loudly outside the Trump International Hotel & Tower, indicating how strongly they felt about his presence in a city that largely opposed him politically. One resident famously stated that he \"represents everything that Chicago isn’t,\" and her dismissive gesture towards the building highlighted the emotional disdain felt by many towards the Trump brand in Chicago [Query 2_evidence_1].\n\n2. **Calls to Remove the Trump Sign**: In recent discussions surrounding the Trump Tower's iconic sign, the Chicago Tribune editorial board called for its removal, reflecting a shift in public sentiment against Trump following various controversial comments and actions. This outrage signifies a larger movement of residents expressing their dissatisfaction with the Trump brand, which may extend to symbolic gestures such as lighting displays [Query 1_evidence_1]. Although not directly an instance of lights, the call for removal indicates a strong sentiment against Trump that could motivate other forms of dissent.\n\n3. **Symbolism of Lights in Dissent**: Although the evidence provided does not contain a specific example of lights being used by residents of Trump Tower to express disdain for Trump, the act of using lights as a form of protest has been exemplified in various situations. For example, the display of rainbow lights in Jacksonville to symbolize resistance and solidarity against anti-LGBTQ+ policies serves as a parallel to how residents might use lighting displays to express political and social dissent against Trump’s policies and remarks. This suggests that creative light displays could be a plausible avenue for similar political expressions in Chicago, although specific instances need to be verified [Query 1_evidence_2].\n\nIn conclusion, while there is no direct evidence of residents of Trump Tower Chicago utilizing lights specifically to express disdain for Trump, the overall sentiment and historical responses to his visits and the ongoing discourse around the Trump sign indicate a profound dislike. The rationale behind using lights as a protest method is supported by various protest movements, suggesting that such displays of disdain through lights are likely but not confirmed in this case.",

        "Answer": "Residents of Trump Tower in Chicago have shown their disdain for Donald Trump, but specific instances or reports of light displays specifically used by them are not well-documented. However, there are a few relevant pieces of evidence that suggest some residents have utilized creative forms of protest, including the use of lights or decorations in their expressions of dissatisfaction. 1. **Use of Lights in Protest**: During a rally on December 17, 2019, against Trump’s impeachment, a protester named Susan Lawrence held up a sparkling protest poster with lights held in place by American flag duct tape. She indicated that she repurposed some of her holiday decorations for the protest, showcasing a direct connection between the use of lights as a form of dissent against Trump. 2. **General Climate of Protest**: Following the election of Donald Trump, many protests occurred in Chicago, including gatherings around Trump Tower where residents expressed their opposition. While specific reports predominantly reflect the usage of signs and chants, the overall atmosphere of these protests indicates that residents were considering various forms of symbolic protest against Trump and his policies. 3. **Symbolism of Protest Displays**: The broader context of protests in Chicago includes various symbolic gestures, such as the collective use of signs and thematic attire by protesters. These acts often incorporate visual elements, including lights, as seen in the aforementioned December 2019 rally, suggesting that while not exhaustive, there is a cultural precedence for using lights to symbolize dissent. In conclusion, while there are anecdotal mentions of light displays in protest, particularly in the context of the December 2019 rally, specific instances detailing organized light displays by Trump Tower residents as a method of expressing disdain for Trump remain limited and not comprehensively documented.",
