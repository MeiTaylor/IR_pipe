  "Task": "Based on the information of each evidence in 'Evidence Found and Judgments on Them', especially the link and snippet which generally contain the publication time of the webpage, evaluate the timeliness (Newness score, 0~10 points, provide a score). Consider how recent the evidence is compared to the current date of July 2024. More recent evidence should receive higher scores, while older evidence should receive lower scores.

  Similarly, based on the information of each evidence, especially the content of the title and snippet, evaluate the relevance of this evidence to the current question (Relevance score, 0~10 points, provide a score). Consider how closely the evidence addresses the specifics of the question. More directly relevant evidence should receive higher scores, while less relevant evidence should receive lower scores.

  For each evidence (evidence0, evidence1, evidence2, evidence3, evidence4, evidence5, evidence6, evidence7, evidence8, evidence9), provide the following:
  1. "Newness Score": score, justification
  2. "Relevance Score": score, justification
  Each evidence should include these details, specified as 'evidenceN' where N is the evidence number."

Claim: A viral video authentically shows a shark swimming in a flooded street of Fort Myers, Florida, during Hurricane Ian in September 2022.', 'content': 'About this rating\nThe video is authentic and was shot by Fort Myers resident Dominic Cameratta as Hurricane Ian made landfall on Sept. 28, 2022. However ...\nIt has not been established with any certainty that the aquatic animal in the video is a shark.\nIn late September 2022, as Hurricane Ian was beginning to make landfall along the southern Florida coastline, a 10-second, low-resolution cellphone video that allegedly showed a shark swimming in floodwaters in Fort Myers went viral:\n\n\nThe viewing audience on social media was split as to its opinion on the authenticity of the footage. Many thought it was genuine, or at least likely so. Others, perhaps because they were more in tune with the long history of image fakery on the internet during major hurricanes, were skeptical. Some even insisted they\'d seen the video before in connection with other hurricanes. Skeptics and believers alike tagged Snopes, or searched our site, to try to authenticate it. As of this update, we can confirm the video is real, though the question of whether the creature seen in the video is a shark or some other type of aquatic animal remains unanswered.\nThe earliest posting of the video we\'re aware of is this one, tweeted on Sept. 28 at 10:12 a.m. EDT:\n\n\nGiven that a massive storm surge struck Fort Myers Beach on nearby Estero Island at approximately that hour, it\'s plausible that there was already some inland flooding.\nWe contacted a Twitter user named Brad Habuda, who was credited in one of the most viral tweets as the source of the video. Habuda told us (as well as his followers) that the footage was shot by a person named "Ed Bell" in Devonwood, a Fort Myers neighborhood. We asked Habuda additional questions about the video — such as how he obtained it — but he did not address them. Furthermore, no one under the name "Ed Bell" stepped forward to take credit for, or provide more details about, the video, nor were we able to locate that person.\nA separate Twitter account, @TruthsBeTold, tweeted the earliest known instance of the video, and that user told his followers that the video was shot by an unidentified friend. "Ok, I see everybody is wondering if this is the real deal or not," @TruthsBeTold tweeted. "It’s real and it’s from today. For obvious reasons my friend who sent this is a little out of communicato at the moment. I will be letting him know all those who have contacted me about the rights once he is safe." There were no further details about the friend in that account\'s timeline, including whether he is the same person mentioned above, "Ed Bell."\nA Sept. 29 thread tweeted by Storyful Deputy News Editor Rob McDonagh revealed the name of the person who actually did shoot the video, a Fort Myers resident named Dominic Cameratta, who provided proof that he shot it in the form of a pair of MP4 files whose metadata shows a creation date and time of Sept. 28, 2022, at just after 8:00 a.m. We contacted Cameratta, who had little to say beyond confirming that the video was his and not a hoax, but he did share the MP4 files with Snopes for verification. We also contacted McDonagh, who walked us through the steps he took to find and vet Cameratta.\nIn sum, the video is real and was shot by a Fort Myers resident on Sept. 28, but though the animal in the video appears to be a shark, and may well be a shark, we have no way to verify that, and it may not be possible to do so given the poor quality of the image.\nUpdate [Sept.29, 2022]: Updated to confirm the video is real; rating changed from "Research in Progress" to "Mixture."\nDavid Emery is a West Coast-based writer and editor with 25 years of experience fact-checking rumors, hoaxes, and contemporary legends.\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n© 1995 - 2024 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com'}, 'Query 1_evidence_2': {'title': 'For Once, the Hurricane Shark Was Real - The New York Times', 'link': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/30/us/hurricane-shark-ian-hoax.html', 'snippet': 'Sep 30, 2022 ... ... video swimming on a street in Fort Myers, Fla., this week ...

The news agencies interviewed Dominic Cameratta, a real estate agent who filmed it with his cellphone, and reviewed the clip’s metadata to confirm it was recorded this week.\nThe video shows a fish that looks to be 4 feet long, with sharp dorsal fins, flipping and flopping in the water. “I didn’t know what it was,” Cameratta said. “I zoomed in, and all my friends were like, ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nExperts interviewed by the AP voiced mixed opinions on whether it was indeed a shark.

The same image has been widely recirculated after subsequent storms in different areas: In 2016, it was in Daytona Beach, Fla.; a year later, in Houston; and in 2018, it was in Wrightsville Beach, N.C.\nSnopes reported that the original image from 2011 also was a hoax. It incorporated a 2005 photograph of a kayaker being trailed by a great white shark.\nHurricane Ian has devastated Florida, killing at least 23 people, according to state officials.

        "snippet": "Sep 29, 2022 ... Claim: A viral video authentically shows a shark swimming in a flooded street of Fort Myers, Florida, during Hurricane Ian in September 2022.",
        "content": "About this rating\nThe video is authentic and was shot by Fort Myers resident Dominic Cameratta as Hurricane Ian made landfall on Sept. 28, 2022. However ...\nIt has not been established with any certainty that the aquatic animal in the video is a shark.\nIn late September 2022, as Hurricane Ian was beginning to make landfall along the southern Florida coastline, a 10-second, low-resolution cellphone video that allegedly showed a shark swimming in floodwaters in Fort Myers went viral:\n\n\nThe viewing audience on social media was split as to its opinion on the authenticity of the footage. Many thought it was genuine, or at least likely so. Others, perhaps because they were more in tune with the long history of image fakery on the internet during major hurricanes, were skeptical. Some even insisted they'd seen the video before in connection with other hurricanes. Skeptics and believers alike tagged Snopes, or searched our site, to try to authenticate it. As of this update, we can confirm the video is real, though the question of whether the creature seen in the video is a shark or some other type of aquatic animal remains unanswered.\nThe earliest posting of the video we're aware of is this one, tweeted on Sept. 28 at 10:12 a.m. EDT:\n\n\nGiven that a massive storm surge struck Fort Myers Beach on nearby Estero Island at approximately that hour, it's plausible that there was already some inland flooding.\nWe contacted a Twitter user named Brad Habuda, who was credited in one of the most viral tweets as the source of the video. Habuda told us (as well as his followers) that the footage was shot by a person named \"Ed Bell\" in Devonwood, a Fort Myers neighborhood. We asked Habuda additional questions about the video — such as how he obtained it — but he did not address them. Furthermore, no one under the name \"Ed Bell\" stepped forward to take credit for, or provide more details about, the video, nor were we able to locate that person.\nA separate Twitter account, @TruthsBeTold, tweeted the earliest known instance of the video, and that user told his followers that the video was shot by an unidentified friend. \"Ok, I see everybody is wondering if this is the real deal or not,\" @TruthsBeTold tweeted. \"It’s real and it’s from today. For obvious reasons my friend who sent this is a little out of communicato at the moment. I will be letting him know all those who have contacted me about the rights once he is safe.\" There were no further details about the friend in that account's timeline, including whether he is the same person mentioned above, \"Ed Bell.\"\nA Sept. 29 thread tweeted by Storyful Deputy News Editor Rob McDonagh revealed the name of the person who actually did shoot the video, a Fort Myers resident named Dominic Cameratta, who provided proof that he shot it in the form of a pair of MP4 files whose metadata shows a creation date and time of Sept. 28, 2022, at just after 8:00 a.m. We contacted Cameratta, who had little to say beyond confirming that the video was his and not a hoax, but he did share the MP4 files with Snopes for verification. We also contacted McDonagh, who walked us through the steps he took to find and vet Cameratta.\nIn sum, the video is real and was shot by a Fort Myers resident on Sept. 28, but though the animal in the video appears to be a shark, and may well be a shark, we have no way to verify that, and it may not be possible to do so given the poor quality of the image.\nUpdate [Sept.29, 2022]: Updated to confirm the video is real; rating changed from \"Research in Progress\" to \"Mixture.\"\nDavid Emery is a West Coast-based writer and editor with 25 years of experience fact-checking rumors, hoaxes, and contemporary legends.\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n© 1995 - 2024 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com"

        "content": "clockThis article was published more than 1 year ago\nFor years, there has been a deluge of fake videos and memes after major storms that claim to show sharks swimming in flooded streets. So when a video purporting to show a shark in an inundated backyard in Fort Myers, Fla., surfaced during Hurricane Ian this week, gathering millions of views on Twitter, viewers were skeptical.\nBut this time, the recording was real — even if there is no confirmation yet that what it depicted was a shark, according to Storyful, which first authenticated the video, and the Associated Press. The news agencies interviewed Dominic Cameratta, a real estate agent who filmed it with his cellphone, and reviewed the clip’s metadata to confirm it was recorded this week.\nThe video shows a fish that looks to be 4 feet long, with sharp dorsal fins, flipping and flopping in the water. “I didn’t know what it was,” Cameratta said. “I zoomed in, and all my friends were like, ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nExperts interviewed by the AP voiced mixed opinions on whether it was indeed a shark. George Burgess, a former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark program, said the fish appears to be a juvenile shark. But Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami’s shark conservation program, said it was difficult to tell what it was.\nWhat’s been happening with animals in Florida during Hurricane Ian?\nImages purportedly showing sharks in urban areas after hurricanes and major floods have been repeatedly debunked since at least 2011, according to Snopes, a fact-checking website.\nOne image of a shark swimming along a flooded highway was uploaded after Hurricane Irene hit Puerto Rico in August 2011. The same image has been widely recirculated after subsequent storms in different areas: In 2016, it was in Daytona Beach, Fla.; a year later, in Houston; and in 2018, it was in Wrightsville Beach, N.C.\nSnopes reported that the original image from 2011 also was a hoax. It incorporated a 2005 photograph of a kayaker being trailed by a great white shark.\nHurricane Ian has devastated Florida, killing at least 23 people, according to state officials. It made its second landfall in the United States on Friday, hitting coastal South Carolina as a Category 1 storm with lashing rains and strong winds."
