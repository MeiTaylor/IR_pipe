        "question": "Did Donald Trump visit Maui after the August 2023 wildfires?",
        "answer": "After searching online, there is no credible information or evidence to verify whether Donald Trump visited Maui after the August 2023 wildfires. It appears that there are no fact-checking articles, official statements, or relevant evidence regarding this specific claim. Without verifiable sources to confirm this information, it is advisable to approach such claims with caution and seek reliable sources for accurate and verified information."

    "Query 2": {
        "question": "Evidence of Donald Trump's visit to Maui August 2023 wildfires",
        "answer": "I found information related to Donald Trump and the Maui wildfires in August 2023. However, there seems to be a misleading video claiming Trump visited Maui amid the wildfires. The reality is that the video actually dates back to 2019 and shows his visit to Alabama after a deadly event there, not Maui[*1*](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2023/08/18/video-falsely-claims-trump-visited-maui-amid-wildfires-fact-check/70614328007/).\n\nIt's important to verify information from credible sources to ensure accuracy."

    "QA": {
        "Question": "Is there verified evidence confirming Donald Trump's visit to Maui following the August 2023 wildfires as depicted in the video?",
        "Answer": "Based on the information available, there is currently no verified evidence confirming that Donald Trump visited Maui following the August 2023 wildfires, as depicted in the video in question. The 'Online_LLM_Answer' highlights that extensive searches yielded no credible information or evidence to support the claim of his visit. Furthermore, the video referenced appears to be misleading: it actually depicts an event from 2019 where Trump visited Alabama after a different disaster, not a visit to Maui. Given this analysis, I would evaluate the confidence in the assertion that there is no verified evidence supporting Trump's visit to Maui as 95%. This high level of confidence is based on the absence of credible sources or fact-checking articles that confirm such a visit and the identification of the video as misleading. It is essential to rely on verified sources when evaluating claims of this nature.",
