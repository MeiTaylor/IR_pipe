In a matter of months mobile Nazi killing units, which had begun shooting all adult male Jews during the invasion of the Soviet Union, expanded to include a genocide targeting women, children, and entire Jewish communities. On January 20, 1942, top Nazi officials and representatives of the Reich authorities met in Wannsee, a suburb outside of Berlin. At this meeting, chaired by Reinhard Heydrich, the Reich Security Main Office formed the extermination plans for the âFinal Solution to the Jewish Question.â The , as it is now called, led to the creation of a network of extermination camps designed to systematically murder the entire European Jewish population. Before the killing centers opened at Birkenau, Treblinka, Sobibor, Belzec, and Majdanek, more than 1.5 million Jews had already been murdered by the Germans, their Axis allies, and local collaborators in Ukraine, Belarus, and other USSR republics. These were the first victims of the Holocaust. They were not transported by trains to the famous killing sites in Poland, with their gas chambers and crematoria that typically characterize the Holocaust in the minds of most people. Instead, these Holocaust victims ... [Content truncated]",

With conflict largely shifted to the east, the intensity of warfare may well be felt less in other parts of the country (the largest in Europe by land area discounting Russia) where people have been photographed recently enjoying summer weather. These pictures, however, have led some to claim that Ukraine has not been as badly bombarded as media reports hereto have suggested. The Claim A tweet posted on June 16, 2022, shows dozens of people using what appears to be a small beach in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. The tweet, which has more than 10,000 engagements, was posted by YouTuber Alex Belfield, who suggests that the media are making exaggerated and misleading claims about the conflict's severity. Ermmm. Ukraine doesnât look like a warzone to me today? How about you?Iâm starting to question the MSM. Maybe they donât tell us the whole story???? ð pic.twitter.com/vUlEmd5sHZ Similar tweets have also been dismissive of the scenes captured in Kyiv.

These beachy areas have long been a popular spot for swimming and sunbathing in the Ukrainian capital, with this year being no exception. Being the second-largest country in Europe after Russia, it's reasonable to believe that some parts of Ukraine may see less direct military action than others. While the capital is not invulnerable and has also been shelled in past weeks, the current battlegrounds in the northeast and Donbas regions are ... [Content truncated]",

Indirect health effects of the war have likely accounted for an even greater amount of civilian morbidity and mortality. The war has displaced more than 11 million people. Russiaâs military forces have caused extensive damage to civilian infrastructure. The war has devastated Ukraineâs economy and reduced food and energy security in many countries. The war has caused more than $56.4 billion in damage to the environment. There has been widespread chemical contamination of air, water, and soil, and 30% of Ukraine has been contaminated with landmines and unexploded ordnance. Landscape destruction, shelling, wildfires, deforestation, and pollution have adversely affected 30% of Ukraineâs protected areas. Russiaâs seizure of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and destruction of the Nova Kakhovka Dam have posed risks of long-term environmental catastrophe. Most of these environmental impacts threaten human health. In addition to enormous human costs, Russiaâs war on Ukraine has had devastating impacts on the ... [Content truncated]",

The attack, which included drones, cruise missiles and potentially ballistic missiles, was âexceptionalâ in its intensity, Ukrainian officials said. A Patriot air defense system â the air defense in the U.S. arsenal â was damaged in the attack, a U.S. official said Tuesday, speaking on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. The extent of damage is unclear, the official said, though it is unlikely Ukraine will need to ship it to another country for repair.

Employed by a company contracted by the U.S. Embassy, Shonovâs âonly role at the time of his arrest was to compile media summaries of press items from publicly available Russian media sources,â Miller said, adding that Russiaâs targeting of Shonov âhighlights the Russian Federationâs blatant use of increasingly repressive laws against its own citizens.â * **Wagner** **Yevgeniy Prigozhin claimed that an American national fighting for Ukraine had been killed in the Bakhmut region.** In comments posted to a ...
