The ensuing fighting to the highest levels of political violence recorded in a single country by ACLED in 2022, exacting a heavy toll on civilians who are not only caught up in shelling and indiscriminate strikes, but are also subjected to deliberate attacks and harsh treatment in occupied areas. Kyiv was the prime target of the attack. Ukrainian forces stopped Russian columns north of the capital and, by April 2022, forced their retreat across the border. In southern and eastern Ukraine, however, Russian forces quickly seized the entire Kherson and much of the Zaporizhia regions as well as the eastern part of the Kharkiv region and the southern part of the Donetsk region. Upon suffering setbacks in northern Ukraine, Russian forces concentrated on securing the entire Donbas and consolidating their hold of the land bridge to the annexed Crimean peninsula. By mid-summer 2022, Russia had largely occupied the Luhansk region but eventually lost momentum and became embroiled in the heavily fortified northern part of the Donetsk region. In early September 2022, Ukrainian forces broke through thinly manned Russian defenses and liberated most of the Kharkiv region, thus denying Russia an axis of attack on the Donbas. On 30 September 2022, Russia annexed the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhia regions of Ukraine following hastily arranged referendums claiming improbable turnouts and votes in favor of unification with Russia.1 Albeit denied air superiority in non-occupied areas, Russia methodically bombed targets elsewhere in Ukraine throughout its invasion \u2013 often striking non-military sites, and killing or maiming civilians in the country\u2019s hinterland. Ukraine\u2019s civilian energy infrastructure also became the target of salvos of missiles and scores of Iranian-made suicide drones. By ... [Content truncated]",

Here we analysed the multifaceted impacts of the military actions on freshwater resources and water infrastructure during the first three months of the conflict. We identified the nature of the impacts, the kind of pressures imposed on the water sector and the negative consequences for the availability and quality of freshwater resources for the civilian population. Our results showed that many water infrastructures such as dams at reservoirs, water supply and treatment systems and subsurface mines have been impacted or are at risk from military actions. Continuation of the conflict will have multiple negative sustainability implications not only in Ukraine but also on a global scale, hampering achievement of clean water and sanitation, conservation and sustainable use of water resources, and energy and food security.

At the same time, freshwater as a resource2 and related water infrastructure3 are among the most vulnerable sectors during armed conflicts.

Temperatures, cloud cover or even the radioactivity in the soil could determine when and where Russian troops make a possible move. For centuries, armies and nations have waged wars on these same lands, from the steppes to the Eastern European heartland, and have faced similar obstacles \u2014 from mucky wetlands to rushing rivers and treacherous mountain ranges. Russia, while mobilizing more than 100,000 troops along the Ukraine border, denies it plans to invade. But Washington and its allies are preparing for possible aggression by sending military personnel and equipment to NATO members near Ukraine. Now, with airstrike capabilities and state-of-the-art materiel on both sides, geography and weather are less of a factor than they were in the past. But they still could influence the timing and the tide of a potential conflict. Cold weather provides hard, fast terrain countrywide for an invasion, experts said. Warmer weather starting in later February and into March brings with it thawing grounds, leading to muddy conditions that are less than ideal for heavy military vehicles. \u201cIt is very inconvenient to carry out offensive operations in the spring,\u201d said Kirill Mikhailov, an analyst at the Conflict Intelligence Team, an independent Russian open-source investigative organization that monitors Russia\u2019s military. \u201cBecause the thaw turns ravines into creeks, and creeks into rivers.

With living conditions worsening, and crossfire still claiming casualties, people residing in eastern Ukraine\u2019s conflict zone feel increasingly abandoned by the central government. Reintegrating the area requires Russian withdrawal, but in the meantime Kyiv can and should better protect civilians and meet humanitarian needs. What\u2019s new? Ukrainians in Donbas, the country\u2019s eastern conflict zone, are in their fifth year of a humanitarian crisis deepened by Russian intervention \u2013 and also by Ukrainian government policies. Many complain that their country has forgotten about their plight and that the state no longer wants them as citizens. Why does it matter? Russia\u2019s withdrawal is necessary for Kyiv\u2019s reintegration of Donbas \u2013 but not sufficient. Only if the region\u2019s war-weary civilians are convinced that their government values their safety and prosperity are they likely to play an active role in that reintegration. What should be done? Moscow and Kyiv must do more to protect civilians, in keeping with international humanitarian law and their commitments under the Minsk agreements. Kyiv can improve its chances of peaceful reintegration by restoring access to subsidies, easing restrictions on freedom of movement and trade, and compensating Donbas residents for property losses. Four years after Kremlin-backed armed groups seized parts of Ukraine\u2019s eastern region of Donbas, the peace process has stalled and the conflict has largely faded from global headlines. Yet Ukrainians on both sides of the Donbas front lines face a humanitarian crisis and a growing sense of abandonment by both Kyiv and Moscow. Much if not most of the responsibility for the conflict lies with the Kremlin, over which Kyiv and its international partners have limited leverage. Yet ... [Content truncated]",

The calls for action took on a familiar ring, with experts and delegates alike recalling years of appeals for the world body to respect its landmark and unanimously adopted civilian protection resolutions: 2286 (2016), 2417 (2018), 2474 (2019), 2475 (2019) and 2573 (2021). Outlining the grim reality, Ramesh Rajasingham, Director at the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, one of four experts briefing the Council, said the Ukraine war and other conflicts have pushed the number of people fleeing to more than 100 million for the first time on record. In Afghanistan, attacks against health-care facilities have affected access for 300,000 people, while in Yemen, only half of health facilities are functioning. By the end of 2021, conflict drove acute food insecurity for 140 million people in 24 countries. Globally, food, fuel and fertilizer prices are now skyrocketing, he said, with a 30 per cent jump in food prices alone threatening people across Africa and the Middle East. He pushed States and non-State armed groups to track reports of civilian harm, gauge the impact of military operations and shift course, if necessary. Picking up that thread, Robert Mardini, Director-General of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), described the appalling human cost of using explosive weapons with wide-area effects in urban areas: countless people killed, homes destroyed, hospitals overwhelmed by complex injuries and survivors left with lifelong ...
