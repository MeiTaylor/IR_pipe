After touring, the damage, he promised the federal government would help Maui \"for as long as it takes\" to recover from the devastation. \"The country grieves with you, stands with you and will do everything possible to help you recover,\" he said in a speech, delivered next to a 150-year-old banyan tree in Old Lahaina which had been burned in the fires. \"Today it's burned, but it's still standing,\" Mr Biden said of the tree. !

By Catherine Toth Fox May 17, 2024 \u00b7 6 min read Catherine Toth Fox Visiting the whole island can help stimulate the local economy, still reeling nine months after the fires. At the end of April, I visited the Westin Maui Resort & Spa on the sunny coast of Kaanapali, about 3 miles north of Lahaina. The high-end hotel had just wrapped up a $160 million transformation and invited media to tour the property.

While U.S. visitor arrivals to Maui were the highest it\u2019s been since the deadly August 2023 wildfires \u2014 in the wake of the fire, arrivals by air to Maui had dropped to as much as 51.4% \u2014 the numbers are significantly down from where they should be.

Robert Dyckman, 74, and Buddy Jantoc, 79, were the first to be named. On Wednesday night local time in Hawaii, County Maui officials confirmed Melva Benjamin, 71, Virginia Dofa, 90 and Alfredo Galinato, 79, were also killed in the fires. More than 1,000 people are estimated still to be missing. The fire, which destroyed the historic town of Lahaina within hours, has been followed by a slow and gruelling search for victims. Mr Jantoc's body was discovered at his home in an old people's home in Lahaina, the New York Times reported. Relatives told the newspaper he was known by family as \"Mr Aloha\" and regaled them with tales of his heyday as a bass guitarist playing alongside Carlos Santana and George Benson. \"I'm hoping he was asleep,\" his daughter-in-law said. \"I hope to God he did not suffer.\" Twenty sniffer dogs trained to detect bodies have led teams on a block-by-block search of the wreckage, a 5sq mile (13sq km) area now filled with twisted metal and other debris. Another 20 canine teams are expected to join the search, said Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) Administrator Deanne Criswell on Wednesday. \"This is a really hard disaster. And this is a really difficult search operation,\" she told reporters in Washington DC. \"This is also going to be a very long and hard recovery.\" Previously on Tuesday evening, Governor Josh Green said 27% of the disaster site had been searched. In a televised address he warned the number of dead could climb significantly and even double over the next 10 days.

Mr Biden and First Lady Jill Biden toured the charred ruins of the town of Lahaina and met first responders. At least 114 people have died and 850 people are still missing. Hawaii's governor has said many of the victims may be children. \"For as long as it takes, we're going to be with you,\" said Mr Biden, who spoke for about 10 minutes amid the rubble. \"The whole country will be with you.\" He added: \"The country grieves with you, stands with you and will do everything possible to help you recover.\" Mr Biden - who also took an aerial tour - described the wildfire devastation as \"overwhelming\". The president and the federal agencies he oversees have come under fire from Hawaiians who say aid has been inadequate and poorly organised. Republicans have led criticism of the Democratic president for having been on two holidays since the fire struck on 8 August. To visit Hawaii, Mr Biden paused his current vacation at Lake Tahoe in Nevada, where he is renting a home belonging to a Democratic donor, according to the White House. When asked about the rising death toll on 13 August while he was at a Delaware beach, Mr Biden angered some Hawaiians by saying: \"No comment\". The White House has said Mr Biden delayed his trip to the disaster zone so he wouldn't distract from recovery operations. The president issued a major disaster declaration on 10 August to expedite federal funding and assistance to the area. The Federal Emergency Management Agency ... [Content truncated]",
