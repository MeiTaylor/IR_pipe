The state\u2019s electric utility responded with some preemptive steps but did not use what is widely regarded as the most aggressive but effective safety measure: shutting down the power. Emergency response questioned as Hawaiians survey what remains after wildfires Hawaiian Electric, the utility that oversees Maui Electric and provides service to 95 percent of the state\u2019s residents, did not deploy what\u2019s known as a \u201cpublic power shutoff plan,\u201d which involves intentionally cutting off electricity to areas where big wind events could spark fires. A number of states, including California, have increasingly adopted this safety strategy after what were then the nation\u2019s most destructive and deadliest modern fires, in 2017 and 2018. Hawaiian Electric was aware that a power shut-off was an effective strategy, documents show, but had not adopted it as part of its fire mitigation plans, according to the company and two former power and energy officials interviewed by The Washington Post. Nor, in the face of predicted dangerous winds, did it act on its own, utility officials said, fearing uncertain consequences. The decision to avoid shutting off power is reflective of the utility\u2019s struggles to bolster its aging and vulnerable infrastructure against wildfires, said Jennifer Potter, who lives in Lahaina and was a member of the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission until just nine months ago.
