AILSA CHANG, HOST: Seven time zones east of Moscow today, Russian President Vladimir Putin greeted the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un. Russia had announced Kim was coming for this summit of two authoritarians, but details of the meeting's timing and location were kept secret until Kim's arrival in his armored train after a two-day journey from Pyongyang. NPR's Charles Maynes reports from Moscow that each leader is looking to gain something from the other.CHARLES MAYNES, BYLINE: Kim's state visit came at Putin's invitation.

In fact, before Kim's arrival, Putin told reporters Russia would help North Korea's quest to launch a satellite. That's why we're here, said Putin. The North Korean leader showed a big interest in rocket technology. In turn, Kim was full of praise for his host. Speaking through an interpreter in official remarks before the press, Kim fully endorsed Russia's invasion of Ukraine, calling it part of a sacred struggle to defend Russia against Western imperialism. The day ended with a state dinner and remarks from both leaders.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SUPREME LEADER KIM JONG UN: (Speaking Korean).MAYNES: Through an interpreter, Kim toasted Putin's health...(SOUNDBITE OF CHAIRS MOVING)MAYNES: ...And the crowd rose to its feet as Kim called for ...

The European Parliament called Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko “an accomplice” in the war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine in a resolution adopted Wednesday. “By enabling Russia’s unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine, the Lukashenko regime has become an accomplice in the crimes committed by Russia, which implies responsibility for the destruction and damage caused to Ukraine,” the resolution reads, adding that “the special international tribunal on the crime of aggression perpetrated by Russia against Ukraine must have jurisdiction to investigate not only Putin and the Russian political and military leadership but also the Belarusian leadership.” The European Parliament urged European Union institutions and members “to enable the criminal prosecution of Belarusian officials who are complicit in the crime of aggression, war crimes, crimes against humanity and crimes of genocide committed against Ukraine.” It called for the establishment of an International Criminal Court country office in Ukraine and “to find legal pathways for seizing assets of the Belarusian leadership and related Belarusian entities involved in the Russian war effort” in order to support the reconstruction of Ukraine. The European Parliament also called on EU member states to “broaden and strengthen the scope of their sanctions” against Russia. It suggested applying the same sanctions against Belarus as it currently does against Russia. The parliament also called on Russia and Belarus to be put on “the EU’s high-risk third-country list with regard to combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism.” The resolution urged the International Olympic Committee and other international sports federations “not to allow athletes from Belarus and Russia to compete in the Paris 2024 Olympic Games or any other international sports events.” It also labeled Belarus a “satellite state ...
