                    "content": "Hurricane Shark and Street Shark are nicknames for several claimed instances of a live shark swimming in a flooded urban area, typically in the aftermath of a hurricane. For more than a decade (starting with Hurricane Irene in 2011), all media purporting to document such claims—most notably an image of a shark swimming on a flooded freeway—were debunked as fabrications. However, during Hurricane Ian in 2022, the Associated Press verified a video taken by Dominic Cameratta of a shark or other large fish swimming in flooded Fort Myers, Florida; one consulted expert concluded that the fish was \"a juvenile shark\" while another was unable to determine whether it was a shark.[1] Both the re-emergence of the hoax in hurricane after hurricane and the eventual appearance of a plausible claim have been the subject of commentary and amusement; Daniel Victor of The New York Times described the Associated Press's findings as \"like discovering Bigfoot is real\".[2] The original \"Hurricane Shark\" image was created during Hurricane Irene in 2011, with a claim that the shark was on a street in Puerto Rico.[2] According to The Washington Post, it likely originated on Reddit.[3] In the aftermath of the hurricane, the image was aired by Miami Fox affiliate WSVN,[3] was posted by the Miami Herald, and was widely shared on social media websites including Twitter.[4] The image was debunked by the Post,[3] Snopes.com,[5] and the Toronto Star.[4] It had been created by combining an image of a flooded street in Puerto Rico with a photo of a shark taken by Thomas P. Peschak off of South Africa in 2003.[4] The Post compared it to similar hoax images, such as one supposedly of Osama bin Laden's body following his death.[3] Craig Silverman, writing in the Star, cast it as part of a larger phenomenon of hoax images appearing in the aftermath of significant events.[4] The image has frequently resurfaced on the internet with claims that it was taken during various flooding events,[2] including in Houston during both the 2015 Texas–Oklahoma flood and tornado outbreak and the 2017 floods caused by Hurricane Harvey, and in Daytona Beach, Florida, in 2016 during floods caused by Hurricane Matthew.[5] Peschak has said his fans notify him each time the image re-emerges, but that \"they're more outraged than I am\".[6] After Toronto's Union Station flooded in June 2012, a manipulated image circulated purporting to show two sharks at the base of an escalator bank. The image was later reused in a hoax claiming that a shark tank had burst at the Kuwait Scientific Center.[7][8] While the flooding in Toronto was not the result of a hurricane, the hoax has often been compared to the main Hurricane Shark hoax.[2][9] Later in 2012, after Hurricane Sandy struck New Jersey, other fake shark images circulated in addition to the better-known freeway one. One image appears to depict a shark outside of a home in a suburban area.[10][11] Another appears to show a shark swimming down a suburban street.[12][13] Tom Phillips and Alexis Madrigal found the real shark image used to create the former; Snopes did the same for the latter.[10][13][11] During both Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Florence, fake television breaking news screen captures were seen online saying that the hurricane \"now contains sharks\", although neither contained images of sharks.[14] No, Hurricane Florence does not contain sharks September 13, 2018[15] Hurricane sharks as hoaxes have taken on a life of their own, in social media and in the press. Doctored photos of sharks swimming in urban areas went viral on social media in virtually every disastrous storm and hurricane in the decade since, often copies of the image that first circulated during Irene.[15] Some on social media have treated the Hurricane Shark as a meme, an in-joke hoax to be revived with each disaster, while others have genuinely believed in the authenticity of the photos being spread.[2] Commentators have made comparisons to Sharknado, a film series that also involves sharks caught up in natural disasters.[16][1] In response to the \"now contains sharks\" images circulated during Hurricane Florence, FEMA's Associate Director of Office of Response and Recovery, Jeffrey Byard, denied that \"there's a sharknado effect or anything like that\".[14] Because of the recurring nature of the meme, fact-checkers and journalists in the media have repeatedly needed to clarify that the images of Hurricane sharks were hoaxes. According to Daniel Victor, writing for The New York Times in 2022, Hurricane Shark is the \"longtime nemesis\" of fact-checkers on social media.[2] In Silverman's Verification Handbook, Phillips makes a case study of his work with Madrigal during Hurricane Sandy, describing the images they reviewed as \"strange enough to make you suspicious, yet [not] implausible enough to dismiss out of hand\".[10][13] Rose Eveleth, in a 2014 piece for BBC Future about how to spot fake Sandy photos, includes as her list's final item, \"If it has a shark in it, it's probably fake\".[9] An early claim of sharks in a flooded urban area, predating the original Hurricane Shark hoax, occurred in Goodna, Queensland, Australia, amidst major flooding in January 2011.[4] Butcher Steve Bateman reported a shark, roughly 6 feet (1.8 m) in length, swimming past his shop, and several others reported seeing a shark on a different street.[17] Two local politicians vouched for Bateman's credibility, and The Queensland Times noted that sharks are known to swim up the Bremer River to Goodna.[18] In September 2022, after Hurricane Ian struck Florida, a video emerged online of a shark in a flooded backyard in Fort Myers, Florida, drawing over 12 million views within a day.[1] Initially, the video received skepticism from journalists and fact-checkers, wary of the long history of similar media being hoaxes while also noting that the video seemed more authentic than previous renditions.[2] On September 29, the Associated Press, while noting the history of the Hurricane Shark, confirmed the authenticity of the video based on analysis of the video's metadata and an interview with the videographer, Dominic Cameratta. The Associated Press consulted shark experts George H. Burgess and ... [Content truncated]",

But an A.P. analysis and experts say a wayward finned creature was indeed captured on video swimming on a street in Fort Myers, Fla., this week.\nBy Daniel Victor\nTo professional fact-checkers who sort fact from fable on social media, Hurricane Shark has been a longtime nemesis.\nFor more than a decade, fake, grainy images of a shark swimming in waters it doesn’t belong in — usually a highway and a subway platform — have reliably circulated during nearly every major storm.\nIt was never real. Yet it kept coming up, shared without skepticism yet again, and the checkers of facts were forced to defeat it again, over and over.\nSo you can imagine their hesitant surprise when a new video emerged on Wednesday appearing to show a shark in a backyard near Fort Myers, Fla., which had been battered by Hurricane Ian and was beginning to flood. Though this video didn’t have the telltale signs of fakery that previous versions did, skepticism was warranted as it racked up millions of views on Twitter.\nThen evidence began emerging that it might actually be real. And on Thursday, both Storyful, a news agency, and The Associated Press confirmed its authenticity with interviews and examinations of the original clip’s metadata, nailing down a story reporters thought they would never write.\nIt was like discovering Bigfoot is real.\n“After over half a decade of debunking this hoax every time there was a flood or hurricane, I can’t believe I’m looking at an honest-to-god street shark,” wrote Jane Lytvynenko, a freelance reporter. “Good to finally meet you, pal.”\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

                    "content": "clockThis article was published more than 1 year ago\nFor years, there has been a deluge of fake videos and memes after major storms that claim to show sharks swimming in flooded streets. So when a video purporting to show a shark in an inundated backyard in Fort Myers, Fla., surfaced during Hurricane Ian this week, gathering millions of views on Twitter, viewers were skeptical.\nBut this time, the recording was real — even if there is no confirmation yet that what it depicted was a shark, according to Storyful, which first authenticated the video, and the Associated Press. The news agencies interviewed Dominic Cameratta, a real estate agent who filmed it with his cellphone, and reviewed the clip’s metadata to confirm it was recorded this week.\nThe video shows a fish that looks to be 4 feet long, with sharp dorsal fins, flipping and flopping in the water. “I didn’t know what it was,” Cameratta said. “I zoomed in, and all my friends were like, ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nExperts interviewed by the AP voiced mixed opinions on whether it was indeed a shark. George Burgess, a former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark program, said the fish appears to be a juvenile shark. But Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami’s shark conservation program, said it was difficult to tell what it was.\nWhat’s been happening with animals in Florida during Hurricane Ian?\nImages purportedly showing sharks in urban areas after hurricanes and major floods have been repeatedly debunked since at least 2011, according to Snopes, a fact-checking website.\nOne image of a shark swimming along a flooded highway was uploaded after Hurricane Irene hit Puerto Rico in August 2011. The same image has been widely recirculated after subsequent storms in different areas: In 2016, it was in Daytona Beach, Fla.; a year later, in Houston; and in 2018, it was in Wrightsville Beach, N.C.\nSnopes reported that the original image from 2011 also was a hoax. It incorporated a 2005 photograph of a kayaker being trailed by a great white shark.\nHurricane Ian has devastated Florida, killing at least 23 people, according to state officials. It made its second landfall in the United States on Friday, hitting coastal South Carolina as a Category 1 storm with lashing rains and strong winds.",

                    "content": "It happens every time there’s a hurricane – the shark photos, memes, and old videos showing ‘proof’ that a shark (usually one that looks like a great white) is taking advantage of flooded streets and malls to search for… well, who knows what. For years both journalists and shark scientists have had to put up with the deluge of fake images and videos, telling the public the same message: “this is fake.” In fact, even the Twitter page for Snopes has begged people to stop sharing the proven false photos and videos. So, it was to no one’s surprise when a video popped up after Hurricane Ian made landfall in Florida claiming to capture a shark in floodwaters.\nThis video, however, was different.\n“I didn’t know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,” Cameratta told news outlets. ... [+] “I zoomed in, and all my friends are like: ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nPast hoax videos usually showed sharks in flooded malls or swimming down highways, but this one seemed to be in someone’s backyard near Fort Myers, Florida. The fact that this was a new video garnered a lot of attention, racking up millions of views on Twitter. The skepticism was rampant – and warranted. The first question many asked was, “Is this an actual video?” An answer quickly came with both Storyful and The Associated Press confirming its authenticity through examination of the video’s metadata and subsequent interviews. AP got the scoop from local real estate agent Dominic Cameratta, who confirmed he filmed the clip himself on Wednesday morning. “I didn’t know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,” he told news outlets. “I zoomed in, and all my friends are like: ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nSo, the clip is real. But is that really a shark?\nIt’s hard to tell – and even shark scientists are stumped. George Burgess, a former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark program, told the Washington Post that the fish in the video appears to be a juvenile shark. “Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters — rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments — and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,” Burgess said. “Assuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.”\n“Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters — rivers, estuaries, subtropical ... [+] embayments — and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,” Burgess says.\nDr. Yannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, is on the fence about the video. Papastamatiou pointed to the science that shows many shark species are known to flee shallow, coastal regions ahead of hurricanes, possibly being tipped off to the giant storm’s arrival by a drastic change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he reckons, or been washed into it.\nBut Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami’s shark conservation program, isn’t as convinced, saying it was difficult to tell what exactly the fish was. It should be of note that the video caught the fish swimming near a pond that was overflowing, causing some experts to lean towards this just being an escapee.\nIt seems we will never have a definitive answer to this mystery. While shark experts are split over the identification, some Twitter users were convinced and have dubbed the grainy fish a “street shark.” Perhaps this is a new rendition for “Baby Shark” writers to pick up and write a song about?\n\nOne Community.

                    "content": "Photos and videos of sharks and other marine life swimming in suburban floodwaters make for popular hoaxes during massive storms. But a cellphone video filmed during Hurricane Ian's assault on southwest Florida isn't just another fish story. The eye-popping video, which showed a large, dark fish with sharp dorsal fins thrashing around an inundated Fort Myers backyard, racked up more than 12 million views on Twitter within a day, as users responded with disbelief and comparisons to the \"Sharknado\" film series. Dominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer, confirmed he filmed the clip from his back patio Wednesday morning when he saw something \"flopping around\" in his neighbor's flooded yard. \"I didn't know what it was -- it just looked like a fish or something,\" he told The Associated Press. \"I zoomed in, and all my friends are like, 'It's like a shark, man!'\" He guessed the fish was about four feet (1.2 metres) in length. Experts were of mixed opinion on whether the clip showed a shark or another large fish. George Burgess, former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History's shark program, said in an email that it \"appears to be a juvenile shark,\" while Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, director of the University of Miami's shark conservation program, wrote that \"it's pretty hard to tell.\" Nevertheless, some Twitter users dubbed the hapless fish the \"street shark.\" The surge worsened in Fort Myers as the day went on. Cameratta said the flooding had only just begun when the clip was taken, but that the waters were \"all the way up to our house\" by the time the AP reached him by phone Wednesday evening. He said the fish may have made its way up from nearby Hendry Creek into a retention pond, which then overflowed, spilling the creature into his neighbor's backyard. A visual analysis of nearby property confirmed it matches the physical landmarks in the video. Leslie Guelcher, a professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, was among the online sleuths who initially thought the video was fake. \"Don't think this is real. According to the index on the video it was created in June 2010. Someone else posted it at 10 AM as in Fort Myers, but the storm surge wasn't like that at 10 AM,\" she tweeted Wednesday. Guelcher acknowledged later, though, that online tools she and others were using to establish the video's origins didn't actually show when the video itself was created, merely when the social media profile of the user was created. The AP confirmed through the original clip's metadata that it was captured Wednesday morning. \"It makes a bit more sense from a flooding standpoint,\" she said by email, when informed the fish was spotted near an overflowing pond. \"But how on earth would a shark go from the Gulf of Mexico to a retention pond?\" Yannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, said that most sharks flee shallow bays ahead of hurricanes, possibly tipped off to their arrival by a change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he said, or been washed into it. \"Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters -- rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments -- and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,\" Burgess said. \"Assuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.\" Cameratta sent the video to a group chat on WhatsApp on Wednesday morning, according to his friend John Paul Murray, who sent the AP a timestamped screenshot. \"Amazing content,\" Murray wrote in reply. ------ Associated Press writers Philip Marcelo and Arijeta Lajka in New York contributed to this report. Thursday’s U.S. presidential debate was a re-run that featured two candidates with a combined age of 159, but it went especially poorly for one of them, President Joe Biden.

Canada's unofficial national colours will be on full display Monday as Canadians don patriotic T-shirts, wave hand-held flags and hang bunting to celebrate their country. But while the red-and-white flag for the most part unites Canadians, the colours' meaning is open to interpretation.

                    "content": "When Hurricane Nicole hit Florida on Wednesday night with wind, rain and flooding battering the state, a common hoax resurfaced. A video of fin-like objects being swept down a flooded road on the Sunshine State's east coast sparked a joke that the objects were two sharks carried through the streets by the rushing water.\nThe Category 1 storm hit the coast that was already vulnerable from Hurricane Ian, which hammered the state six weeks ago. Residents were urged to evacuate in certain areas as floodwaters cascaded down roadways. As residents were evacuating, one video shows a car stopped at a flooded intersection and debris carried by the floodwaters rushing through the intersection.\nThe Instagram video, posted by user ohana_surf_shop on Wednesday morning, showed two fin-like objects swept along by floodwaters near an intersection where the user was stopped in his car. The video taker joked, \"There goes a shark, we've got a couple sharks,\" as the objects floated by. Another person in the car laughed during the video.\nThe post's caption said, \"Sharks on the streets!!\" and included hashtags for \"Sharknado,\" a made-for-TV science fiction comedy disaster movie that is commonly referenced when shark hoaxes resurface during hurricanes.\nStoryful, a social media intelligence agency, shared the video and said it was taken by Jordan Schwartz, a local man who owns Ohana Surf Shop in Stuart, Florida.\nThe video was taken after residents received evacuation orders when storm surges breached the coast and flooding overwhelmed local streets. Schwartz also recorded more debris transported by floodwaters down the roadway, including a kayak.\nSchwartz told Newsweek that at first, the debris did look like sharks.\n\"It looks real all the way through,\" he said in an Instagram message. \"So we were kinda in shock and [definitely] thought we had sharks at the beginning.\"\nSchwartz said that as soon as the debris floated past the car in front of him, he realized it wasn't a shark. He said he wasn't aware of the common shark hoaxes that surface during hurricanes when he took the video.\n\"Actually amazed how much feedback we got from this,\" he said.\nSchwartz shared the video twice on his Instagram page. The first was liked nearly 3,900 times and the second nearly 3,000 times.\nShark appearances are common hoaxes that originated in 2012 when a fake image of a shark was depicted swimming down a flooded highway. Since then, the image and others have surfaced on social media whenever a hurricane hits.\nMost recently, a man videoed what appeared to be a shark flopping around in his neighbor's backyard in Fort Myers, Florida, during severe storm surge from Hurricane Ian.\nAfter the video index was confirmed, experts said it's possible that a shark sensed a drop in barometric pressure that preceded the hurricane and, trying to flee, accidentally ended up in a retention pond which, when flooded, tossed the shark into someone's backyard. Storyful, a social media intelligence agency, verified the Fort Myers video was authentic but couldn't determine if the animal was actually a shark or a large fish.\nThe Hurricane Ian shark is an anomaly, and many shark-like objects sighted during hurricanes are later determined to be debris or fake images.\nUpdate 11/10/22, 11:04 a.m. ET: This story was updated with comment from Jordan Schwartz.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nAnna Skinner is a Newsweek senior reporter based in Indianapolis.

Why the Sunshine State tops the rankings of shark bites globally.\nBuy this quiet corner of the stock market as the US braces for a highly active hurricane season, research firm says\n\"I didn't know what it was — it just looked like a fish or something,\" Dominic Cameratta, the Florida resident who took the video, told The Associated Press. \"I zoomed in, and all my friends are like, 'It's like a shark, man!'\"\n \nCameratta, a local real estate developer living in Fort Myers, Florida, estimated the marine animal to be about four feet in length and may have swam from the ocean to a nearby retention pond via a creek. By the time he took the video, the pond was overflowing from floodwaters brought in by the hurricane, spilling the \"shark\" into his neighbor's backyard.\nExperts are still hesitant to call the animal a shark from just the video, but given the size of the creature and dorsal fins peaking above the water's surface, George Burgess, former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History's shark program, told the AP that it \"appears to be a juvenile shark.\"\n\"Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters — rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments — and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,\" Burgess told the AP. \"Assuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.\"\nOther experts weren't as ready to classify the large aquatic animal as a shark. Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, director of the shark conservation program at the University of Miami, told the AP that it was \"pretty hard to tell,\" and Leslie Guelcher, a professor at Mercyhurst University, was initially skeptical of the video's authenticity as well.\n\"It makes a bit more sense from a flooding standpoint,\" she told the AP in an email. \"But how on earth would a shark go from the Gulf of Mexico to a retention pond?\"\nResearch shows that sharks can feel the change in barometric pressure ahead of large storms, including hurricanes, according to Shark Angels, an environmental nonprofit dedicated to shark conservation, which could explain why the Fort Myers shark was compelled to swim up the creek to the retention pond.\nRead next\nBack-to-back shark attacks in Florida, 2 critically injured.
