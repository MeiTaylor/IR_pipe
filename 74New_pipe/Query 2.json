                    "content": "About this rating\nThe video is authentic and was shot by Fort Myers resident Dominic Cameratta as Hurricane Ian made landfall on Sept. 28, 2022. However ...\nIt has not been established with any certainty that the aquatic animal in the video is a shark.\nIn late September 2022, as Hurricane Ian was beginning to make landfall along the southern Florida coastline, a 10-second, low-resolution cellphone video that allegedly showed a shark swimming in floodwaters in Fort Myers went viral:\n\n\nThe viewing audience on social media was split as to its opinion on the authenticity of the footage. Many thought it was genuine, or at least likely so. Others, perhaps because they were more in tune with the long history of image fakery on the internet during major hurricanes, were skeptical. Some even insisted they'd seen the video before in connection with other hurricanes. Skeptics and believers alike tagged Snopes, or searched our site, to try to authenticate it. As of this update, we can confirm the video is real, though the question of whether the creature seen in the video is a shark or some other type of aquatic animal remains unanswered.\nThe earliest posting of the video we're aware of is this one, tweeted on Sept. 28 at 10:12 a.m. EDT:\n\n\nGiven that a massive storm surge struck Fort Myers Beach on nearby Estero Island at approximately that hour, it's plausible that there was already some inland flooding.\nWe contacted a Twitter user named Brad Habuda, who was credited in one of the most viral tweets as the source of the video. Habuda told us (as well as his followers) that the footage was shot by a person named \"Ed Bell\" in Devonwood, a Fort Myers neighborhood. We asked Habuda additional questions about the video — such as how he obtained it — but he did not address them. Furthermore, no one under the name \"Ed Bell\" stepped forward to take credit for, or provide more details about, the video, nor were we able to locate that person.\nA separate Twitter account, @TruthsBeTold, tweeted the earliest known instance of the video, and that user told his followers that the video was shot by an unidentified friend. \"Ok, I see everybody is wondering if this is the real deal or not,\" @TruthsBeTold tweeted. \"It’s real and it’s from today. For obvious reasons my friend who sent this is a little out of communicato at the moment. I will be letting him know all those who have contacted me about the rights once he is safe.\" There were no further details about the friend in that account's timeline, including whether he is the same person mentioned above, \"Ed Bell.\"\nA Sept. 29 thread tweeted by Storyful Deputy News Editor Rob McDonagh revealed the name of the person who actually did shoot the video, a Fort Myers resident named Dominic Cameratta, who provided proof that he shot it in the form of a pair of MP4 files whose metadata shows a creation date and time of Sept. 28, 2022, at just after 8:00 a.m. We contacted Cameratta, who had little to say beyond confirming that the video was his and not a hoax, but he did share the MP4 files with Snopes for verification. We also contacted McDonagh, who walked us through the steps he took to find and vet Cameratta.\nIn sum, the video is real and was shot by a Fort Myers resident on Sept. 28, but though the animal in the video appears to be a shark, and may well be a shark, we have no way to verify that, and it may not be possible to do so given the poor quality of the image.\nUpdate [Sept.29, 2022]: Updated to confirm the video is real; rating changed from \"Research in Progress\" to \"Mixture.\"\nDavid Emery is a West Coast-based writer and editor with 25 years of experience fact-checking rumors, hoaxes, and contemporary legends.\nCompany\nNavigate\nSections\nAccount\n© 1995 - 2024 by Snopes Media Group Inc.\nThis material may not be reproduced without permission.\nSnopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com",

                    "content": "India | Bangladesh | Nepal Hurricane Ian’s 150mph rampage battered the US state of Florida after it made landfall on September 28, leaving 2.4 million homes and businesses without power and floodwaters surging inland. US President Joe Biden says it could be the deadliest storm in Florida’s history as at least 10 deaths have been confirmed, while a substantial toll is feared. Amid the destruction that saw seawater inundating entire neighbourhoods, several social media users are tweeting a photograph of what appears to be a shark swimming in a flooded street in Florida. A reverse image search led us to multiple tweets, dating to as far back as 2011, which have shared this photo. Newschecker learnt that this photo has cropped up multiple times, especially during hurricanes or heavy-rain events in the US, right from the time it was supposedly seen in a Puerto Rico street during Hurricane Irene in August 2011 to an alleged New Jersey sighting during Superstorm Sandy in October 2012. It also made an appearance during August 2017’s Hurricane Harvey in Houston, Texas. In each instance, the photo had been debunked as a fake image by several news outlets in the west. In 2011, when it first appeared as “sighting” of a shark in a flooded Puerto Rican road, the Toronto Star wrote, “The image was debunked when some noticed the shark seemed a little too familiar. It first appeared in an iconic photo snapped by Thomas P Peschak in South Africa in 2003. That shot depicted a lone kayaker in beautiful blue water with the bull shark stalking just a few feet behind. It appeared in Africa Geographic, among other publications. Someone decided to photoshop the shark onto a Puerto Rican street and see if people would fall for it.” During the Houston sighting, Politifact debunked the photo again, stating that it was the same one seen during the Puerto Rico and New York adverse-weather events “The photoshopped image appeared to have taken the shark from a photo that ran in Africa Geographic in 2005,” the report read. Taking a cue from the above reports, we ran a keyword search for “Thomas P Peschak shark kayak”, “Africa Geographic shark viral”, which led us to this photo, via the Africa Geographic and National Geographic. According to the National Geographic, the magazine’s photographer Thomas Peschak had captured the great white shark on camera in 2003, following scientist Trey Snow in a bright yellow kayak off the coast of South Africa. “Ever since then, people have been photoshopping the shark into their pictures to fake scary scenes,” the article read. The photographer, too, wrote about his experience with the photo and the resulting hoax attempts on his website. Peschak stated that he was working with the White Shark Trust for more than 10 months to capture novel images of white sharks that would illustrate current research. “On August 21, 2011, Hurricane Irene battered the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico and flooded many streets. I could never have imagined that my photograph would make an appearance in this context, except this time it was only the shark, minus the kayak. On August 24, the shark appeared on a social news website in the form of a photograph taken from the open window of a car driving along a flooded street. Next to the car was ‘my’ white shark swimming through the flooded streets of Puerto Rico. The image was then picked up and used in a TV bulletin on Channel 7 News Miami. A closer examination of the shark revealed that it was identical to the shark following the kayak in my photograph. It appears that a crafty Photoshop artist superimposed the shark into a scene of a flooded street,” Peschak wrote. The photographer also mentioned that the viral photo had appeared in the wake of Hurricane Sandy too. We also learnt that the shark had been part of another hoax, in June 2012, when several Twitter users circulated a photo of two sharks, claiming that a tank had collapsed in a mall in Kuwait. “The composite resurfaced again in June of 2012, when a shark tank supposedly burst in a popular mall in Kuwait. The photo depicted two sharks (one of which was mine) swimming at the bottom of a submerged escalator,” Peschak wrote in his blog. While comparing the viral images to the original photo, we can see it is the same shark that had been photoshopped onto a flooded street and mall. Viral photo of shark swimming in flooded Florida street is an old, photoshopped picture that has been doing the rounds of social media since 2011.

The storm dropped heavy rains and created storm surges that caused flooding and led to inland rescues and evacuations. Many social media posts claim to show shocking images from the storm. The VERIFY team has been fact-checking viral content to determine what’s real and what isn’t. Was an elephant seal seen scooting along a Florida sidewalk during Hurricane Ian? Florida just outta control right now 😳🦭 pic.twitter.com/LSJMf3bnIt The video, posted to Twitter on Sept. 28, had more than 12 million views. No, an elephant seal was not seen scooting along a Florida sidewalk during Hurricane Ian. The elephant seal video was taken in October 2020 in Puerto Cisnes, Chile. According to Infobae, an Argentinian news outlet, the elephant seal traveled 10 blocks in an area known as the largest urban center in the city of Puerto Cisnes, Chile. With the help of residents in the area, the seal was transported back to the ocean by the Chilean navy. The rescue mission was recorded live on Facebook in October 2020 by a local radio DJ.

When a hurricane hits Florida people do a party pic.twitter.com/B4Vaas2SFD The video clip, shared by multiple accounts on Sept. 28, had hundreds of thousands of views on Twitter. It had more than 1 million likes on TikTok. No, the video wasn’t taken during Ian. It was shared online multiple times before the storm made landfall in Florida, though it was taken in Fort Myers, Florida. Using RevEye, a reverse image search tool, VERIFY found several instances where the video was shared prior to Ian becoming a named storm. The video was posted on Reddit on Aug. 30. This 12-second video was posted to Facebook on Sept. 12. It was also posted on Imgur, an image and video sharing platform, on Sept. 15, about a week and a half before Ian made landfall. Using Google Maps Streetview, VERIFY was able to pinpoint the exact location where the video was taken – from the rooftop of the Lani Kai Island Resort in Fort Myers Beach. The same buildings seen in the video can be seen from Google Maps. The same 7-11 convenience store can be seen across the street from the Lani Kai resort where the video was taken, and right across the street from that, the same blue building. Does this photo show a shark swimming on a Florida highway in Ian’s floodwaters? There are sharks on the highways in Florida. Unreal. pic.twitter.com/sHcgfkrc8o The photo, posted to Twitter on Sept. 28, had more than 28,000 retweets and over 300,000 likes. This photo circulates nearly each hurricane season. This example was shared in 2018 in connection to Hurricane Florence, which wreaked havoc on the Carolinas. Here it was shared during Hurricane Sandy, and here during Hurricane Irma. The image was actually lifted from a September 2005 issue of Africa Geographic. The original photo shows a shark trailing a kayaker, and was later manipulated to look like a shark was swimming through an interstate lane. Were zoo flamingos really moved to a basement bathroom ahead of the storm? Flamingos evacuated to the bathroom at Sunken Gardens, St Pete.🦩🦩 #hurricaneian pic.twitter.com/MX9wNGvzds Some people commenting on the photo claimed they had seen that image before the storm struck Florida on Sept. 28. This one is real! The flamingos are residents of Sunken Gardens park, a botanic park based out of St. Petersburg, Florida. The park tweeted the photo from their official account on Sept. 28, saying the flamingos were safe from the oncoming storm. “We're hunkered down! Our animals are safe w/staff on site to see them through the storm. The flamingos are having a hurricane party in the bathroom; eating, drinking, & dancing. Stay safe out there!” the tweet said. 🦩🌀We're hunkered down! Our animals are safe w/staff on site to see them through the storm. The flamingos are having a hurricane party in the bathroom; eating, drinking, & dancing. 😉Stay safe out there! pic.twitter.com/ejCuuRUdma People on social media might have been confused because this isn’t the first time zookeepers have posted pictures of flamingos in facilities ahead of a storm. In August 1992, Hurricane Andrew, a Category 5 storm, hit Florida and at the time, Miami Zoo’s Ron Magill took a photo of flamingos huddled up. On the 30 year anniversary of Hurricane Andrew, Magill tweeted about the famous photo, writing, “Of the countless images I have captured in my life, none is more iconic than this one. I can't believe it has been 30 years since Hurricane Andrew devastated South Florida. I'll never forget capturing this image of the zoos flamingos huddled in the ladies restroom for protection.” Of the countless images I have captured in my life, none is more iconic than this one. I can't believe it has been 30 years since Hurricane Andrew devastated South Florida. I'll never forget capturing this image of the zoos flamingos huddled in the ladies restroom for protection. pic.twitter.com/iACXIBivSm Was someone seen pulling a pineapple-shaped trailer down a highway during Hurricane Ian evacuations? #HurricaneIan #Hurricane #Ian #TropicalStormIan You know shit is serious when spongebob is evacuating.... pic.twitter.com/sQSfWpJjc3 A tweet with the photo, posted on Sept. 25, had more than 2,500 retweets and over 17,000 likes. No. This is another popular meme that often appears on the internet during storm season. Using RevEye, VERIFY was able to trace the photo to at least September 2017, when it appeared on Imgur, a popular photo sharing website. The photo appeared on Reddit in August 2019 when Hurricane Dorian was nearing Florida. So, we can VERIFY this photo was also not taken when people were evacuating ahead of Hurricane Ian, but actually ... [Content truncated]",

                    "content": "It happens every time there’s a hurricane – the shark photos, memes, and old videos showing ‘proof’ that a shark (usually one that looks like a great white) is taking advantage of flooded streets and malls to search for… well, who knows what. For years both journalists and shark scientists have had to put up with the deluge of fake images and videos, telling the public the same message: “this is fake.” In fact, even the Twitter page for Snopes has begged people to stop sharing the proven false photos and videos. So, it was to no one’s surprise when a video popped up after Hurricane Ian made landfall in Florida claiming to capture a shark in floodwaters.\nThis video, however, was different.\n“I didn’t know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,” Cameratta told news outlets. ... [+] “I zoomed in, and all my friends are like: ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nPast hoax videos usually showed sharks in flooded malls or swimming down highways, but this one seemed to be in someone’s backyard near Fort Myers, Florida. The fact that this was a new video garnered a lot of attention, racking up millions of views on Twitter. The skepticism was rampant – and warranted. The first question many asked was, “Is this an actual video?” An answer quickly came with both Storyful and The Associated Press confirming its authenticity through examination of the video’s metadata and subsequent interviews. AP got the scoop from local real estate agent Dominic Cameratta, who confirmed he filmed the clip himself on Wednesday morning. “I didn’t know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,” he told news outlets. “I zoomed in, and all my friends are like: ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nSo, the clip is real. But is that really a shark?\nIt’s hard to tell – and even shark scientists are stumped. George Burgess, a former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark program, told the Washington Post that the fish in the video appears to be a juvenile shark. “Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters — rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments — and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,” Burgess said. “Assuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.”\n“Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters — rivers, estuaries, subtropical ... [+] embayments — and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,” Burgess says.\nDr. Yannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, is on the fence about the video. Papastamatiou pointed to the science that shows many shark species are known to flee shallow, coastal regions ahead of hurricanes, possibly being tipped off to the giant storm’s arrival by a drastic change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he reckons, or been washed into it.\nBut Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami’s shark conservation program, isn’t as convinced, saying it was difficult to tell what exactly the fish was. It should be of note that the video caught the fish swimming near a pond that was overflowing, causing some experts to lean towards this just being an escapee.\nIt seems we will never have a definitive answer to this mystery. While shark experts are split over the identification, some Twitter users were convinced and have dubbed the grainy fish a “street shark.” Perhaps this is a new rendition for “Baby Shark” writers to pick up and write a song about?\n\nOne Community.

                    "content": "It's common for hoax photos and videos of sharks swimming in flooded streets to surface during hurricanes and they're often quickly debunked. But a new video of a shark in Hurricane Ian's storm surge has people thinking it is the real deal. Hurricane Ian slammed into Florida on Wednesday as a Category 4 hurricane with winds just a few miles per hour away from bumping the classification up to a Category 5. The hurricane resulted in a massive storm surge, and that surge appeared to have pushed a shark into a flooded street in Fort Myers, Florida. While some Twitter users tried to take credit for the video or said they got the video from a friend, the Associated Press has confirmed the video was authentic after speaking with the person who filmed the shark struggling to swim in his backyard. According to the AP report, Dominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer who said he filmed the video Wednesday morning, filmed the shark from his back patio when he saw it flopping around in his neighbor's backyard. Cameratta said at first, he thought the animal was a large fish but soon realized it was a shark. He estimated the shark to be 4 feet long. Cameratta lives near a retention pond, and he said he assumed the shark made it up Hendry Creek and into the pond. The pond then overflowed from storm surge and heavy rain, transporting the shark into the flooded backyard. Some experts told AP they thought the shark looked to be a juvenile. Twitter user THE Alex shared the video at approximately 10 a.m. on Wednesday. The video shows what appears to be a shark flopping around in an apparently flooded street. The animal in the video is seen thrashing its tail back and forth as winds gust in the background. \"My buddy just sent me a video of this shark swimming down his back yard in Fort Myers,\" THE Alex tweeted Wednesday. My buddy just sent me a video of this this shark swimming down his back yard in Fort Myers 😂#hurricane #Ian #HurricaneIan pic.twitter.com/kLon2z3F8Q Leslie Guelcher, an assistant professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University who goes by Dr. G on Twitter, was one of the people who questioned the video's authenticity. Prior to AP's verification, Guelcher tweeted that the video index showed a creation date of June 2010. She later told Newsweek she misread the index data, but she is unconvinced the video is real because the video was taken before the storm surge rose in earnest in Fort Myers. \"I'm still not convinced it is accurate although the person who commented provided the name of who filmed it and where,\" Guelcher said. \"However, a reverse image search on Google, limiting to site:Twitter.com shows a number of posts with at least one being from before the storm surge hit.\" She later said she could see how a shark could go from the Gulf of Mexico into a retention pond. However, some experts expect the shark may have sensed a drop in barometric pressure signifying the approaching hurricane. It may have attempted to flee shallow waters to somewhere safer. However, the shark could have accidentally entered the creek and then the pond in its attempts to flee, or flooding could have forced the animal into the residential area. The video's confirmation was the culmination of five years of searching for Jane Lytvynenko, a freelance reporter who has spent years debunking hoaxes. Before the video was confirmed as real, Lytvynenko implied it had credibility. \"I can't believe I'm looking at an honest-to-god street shark,\" Lytvynenko tweeted. \"Good to finally meet you, pal.\" After over half a decade of debunking this hoax every time there was a flood or hurricane, I can't believe I'm looking at an honest-to-god street shark.Good to finally meet you, pal. https://t.co/hwMWX4Peqo Shark hoaxes have emerged in many hurricanes since a fake image of a shark swimming through a flooded highway was first posted in 2012. Social media agency Storyful also verified the video was authentic but couldn't confirm if the footage showed a small shark or a different fish, such as a cobia. Florida officials warned residents that some wildlife might emerge during the storm, namely bears, alligators and snakes, as wildlife becomes more active and disoriented during massive storms.

                    "content": "Hurricane Shark and Street Shark are nicknames for several claimed instances of a live shark swimming in a flooded urban area, typically in the aftermath of a hurricane. For more than a decade (starting with Hurricane Irene in 2011), all media purporting to document such claims—most notably an image of a shark swimming on a flooded freeway—were debunked as fabrications. However, during Hurricane Ian in 2022, the Associated Press verified a video taken by Dominic Cameratta of a shark or other large fish swimming in flooded Fort Myers, Florida; one consulted expert concluded that the fish was \"a juvenile shark\" while another was unable to determine whether it was a shark.[1] Both the re-emergence of the hoax in hurricane after hurricane and the eventual appearance of a plausible claim have been the subject of commentary and amusement; Daniel Victor of The New York Times described the Associated Press's findings as \"like discovering Bigfoot is real\".[2] The original \"Hurricane Shark\" image was created during Hurricane Irene in 2011, with a claim that the shark was on a street in Puerto Rico.[2] According to The Washington Post, it likely originated on Reddit.[3] In the aftermath of the hurricane, the image was aired by Miami Fox affiliate WSVN,[3] was posted by the Miami Herald, and was widely shared on social media websites including Twitter.[4] The image was debunked by the Post,[3] Snopes.com,[5] and the Toronto Star.[4] It had been created by combining an image of a flooded street in Puerto Rico with a photo of a shark taken by Thomas P. Peschak off of South Africa in 2003.[4] The Post compared it to similar hoax images, such as one supposedly of Osama bin Laden's body following his death.[3] Craig Silverman, writing in the Star, cast it as part of a larger phenomenon of hoax images appearing in the aftermath of significant events.[4] The image has frequently resurfaced on the internet with claims that it was taken during various flooding events,[2] including in Houston during both the 2015 Texas–Oklahoma flood and tornado outbreak and the 2017 floods caused by Hurricane Harvey, and in Daytona Beach, Florida, in 2016 during floods caused by Hurricane Matthew.[5] Peschak has said his fans notify him each time the image re-emerges, but that \"they're more outraged than I am\".[6] After Toronto's Union Station flooded in June 2012, a manipulated image circulated purporting to show two sharks at the base of an escalator bank. The image was later reused in a hoax claiming that a shark tank had burst at the Kuwait Scientific Center.[7][8] While the flooding in Toronto was not the result of a hurricane, the hoax has often been compared to the main Hurricane Shark hoax.[2][9] Later in 2012, after Hurricane Sandy struck New Jersey, other fake shark images circulated in addition to the better-known freeway one. One image appears to depict a shark outside of a home in a suburban area.[10][11] Another appears to show a shark swimming down a suburban street.[12][13] Tom Phillips and Alexis Madrigal found the real shark image used to create the former; Snopes did the same for the latter.[10][13][11] During both Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Florence, fake television breaking news screen captures were seen online saying that the hurricane \"now contains sharks\", although neither contained images of sharks.[14] No, Hurricane Florence does not contain sharks September 13, 2018[15] Hurricane sharks as hoaxes have taken on a life of their own, in social media and in the press. Doctored photos of sharks swimming in urban areas went viral on social media in virtually every disastrous storm and hurricane in the decade since, often copies of the image that first circulated during Irene.[15] Some on social media have treated the Hurricane Shark as a meme, an in-joke hoax to be revived with each disaster, while others have genuinely believed in the authenticity of the photos being spread.[2] Commentators have made comparisons to Sharknado, a film series that also involves sharks caught up in natural disasters.[16][1] In response to the \"now contains sharks\" images circulated during Hurricane Florence, FEMA's Associate Director of Office of Response and Recovery, Jeffrey Byard, denied that \"there's a sharknado effect or anything like that\".[14] Because of the recurring nature of the meme, fact-checkers and journalists in the media have repeatedly needed to clarify that the images of Hurricane sharks were hoaxes. According to Daniel Victor, writing for The New York Times in 2022, Hurricane Shark is the \"longtime nemesis\" of fact-checkers on social media.[2] In Silverman's Verification Handbook, Phillips makes a case study of his work with Madrigal during Hurricane Sandy, describing the images they reviewed as \"strange enough to make you suspicious, yet [not] implausible enough to dismiss out of hand\".[10][13] Rose Eveleth, in a 2014 piece for BBC Future about how to spot fake Sandy photos, includes as her list's final item, \"If it has a shark in it, it's probably fake\".[9] An early claim of sharks in a flooded urban area, predating the original Hurricane Shark hoax, occurred in Goodna, Queensland, Australia, amidst major flooding in January 2011.[4] Butcher Steve Bateman reported a shark, roughly 6 feet (1.8 m) in length, swimming past his shop, and several others reported seeing a shark on a different street.[17] Two local politicians vouched for Bateman's credibility, and The Queensland Times noted that sharks are known to swim up the Bremer River to Goodna.[18] In September 2022, after Hurricane Ian struck Florida, a video emerged online of a shark in a flooded backyard in Fort Myers, Florida, drawing over 12 million views within a day.[1] Initially, the video received skepticism from journalists and fact-checkers, wary of the long history of similar media being hoaxes while also noting that the video seemed more authentic than previous renditions.[2] On September 29, the Associated Press, while noting the history of the Hurricane Shark, confirmed the authenticity of the video based on analysis of the video's metadata and an interview with the videographer, Dominic Cameratta. The Associated Press consulted shark experts George H. Burgess and ... [Content truncated]",

If you have a question you’d like an expert to answer, send it to curiouskidsus@theconversation.com. How can I tell if what I am hearing is true? – Adam, age 10, Maui, Hawaii Have you ever heard a story so exciting you wanted to share it right away? Something like a shark swimming up a flooded highway? An image that seems to show just that was shared by many people after Hurricane Ian struck Florida in 2022. It was also widely shared after Hurricane Harvey hit Houston, Texas, in 2017. It’s a fake – a flooded highway image combined with one of a great white shark. The fact-checking website Snopes found it circulating as far back as 2011 after Hurricane Irene slammed Puerto Rico. Truth can be tricky to determine. Every message you read, see or hear comes from somewhere and was created by someone and for someone. I teach media literacy, which is a way to think about information you get in the messages you receive via media. You might think media means the news, but it also includes TikTok posts, television, books, advertisements and more. When deciding whether to trust a piece of information, it’s good to start with three main questions – who said it, what evidence did they give and how much do you want to believe it? The last one might seem a little strange, but you’ll see why it’s important by the end. Let’s say you’re really excited about a game that’s coming out later this year. You want to be the first to learn about the new creatures, characters and game modes. So when a YouTube video pops up saying, “GAME COMING TWO WEEKS EARLY,” you can’t wait to watch. But when you click, it’s just a guy making predictions. Do you trust him? A source is where information comes from. You get information from sources every day – from teachers, parents and friends to people you’ve never met on news sites, fan channels and social media. You probably have sources you trust and ones you don’t. But why? Would you trust your history teacher to tell you something about history? Probably, because they have a college degree that says they know their stuff. But what if your history teacher told you a fact about science your science teacher said was untrue? You’d probably be better off going with the science teacher for your science facts. Just because a source is trustworthy in one subject doesn’t mean they’re trustworthy in every subject. Let’s go back to the YouTuber. If you’ve watched him for a while and he’s reliably correct, that’s a good start. At the same time, make sure you don’t confuse his having an opinion with actually having knowledge. Just because you like a source doesn’t make it trustworthy. This is true for websites, too. When a site grabs your attention, take a second to check the source at the top. Some fake sites use names that sound trustworthy – like “Boston Tribune” instead of “Boston Globe” or “www.cbs.com.co” instead of “www.cbs.com.” You can click the “About” page to see where they’re really coming from, use lists of known fake sites and other fact-checking resources to avoid getting played. Evidence is what you show when someone says “prove it!” It’s the details that support what a source is saying. Primary sources – people or groups who are directly involved with the information – are best. If you want to learn about the release of a new game, the company’s official accounts or channels would be primary sources. Secondary sources are one step removed – for example, news stories based on primary sources. They aren’t as strong as primary sources but are still useful. For example, most news on gaming site IGN is based on information from game company sources, so it’s a good secondary source. Can a blogger or YouTuber be a secondary source? If their claims start by referencing primary sources like “Electronic Arts says,” that’s good. But if they start with “I think” or “There’s a lot of buzz,” be careful. Emotions can get in the way of knowing what’s true. Messages that make you feel strong emotions – especially ones that are funny or make you angry – are the most important ones to check, but they’re also the hardest to ignore. Advertisers know this. Many ads try to be funny or make the things they’re selling look cool because they want you to focus on how you feel rather than what you think. And being older doesn’t mean you’re automatically better at spotting false information: 41% of 18-to-34-year-olds and 44% of adults 65 and older admitted to having fallen for a fake news story in a 2018 study. Other research showed adults over 65 were seven times as likely to share articles from fake sites as younger people were. So if you’ve been eagerly waiting for that new game, and somebody posts a video that says it’s coming out early, your wanting it to be true can make you ignore your common sense – leaving you open to being fooled. The best question you can ask yourself when you’re thinking about a message is, “Do I want to believe this?” If the answer is yes, it’s a good sign you should slow down and check the source and evidence more closely.

                    "content": "Hurricane Ian turned Florida into a disaster zone what with more than 2.5 million residents being shifted to emergency shelters after almost the entire city was submerged in seawater. At this time, several images and videos of sea creatures being sighted in the streets of the city are being shared on the social media. Prominent among them are a video of a shark swept into the streets at Fort Myers in Florida. Another image of an orca (killer whale) swimming in the streets is also going viral with the caption that due to heavy rains and streets getting flooded, an orca got out of its enclosure (Sea aquarium) and is swimming in the streets. In the image, the orca can be seen swimming on the road while vehicles are moving on the other side of the road. The caption claims \"To all my peeps in Florida: I hope you are okay! I've seen some photos of a shark in the flooded streets or an alligator, but here's an orca! Stay safe!!\" There is one tweet published on September 27, 2022. The claim is FALSE and the image has been morphed. Hurricane Ian flooded Florida completely and the Category-IV storm affected more than 1.8 million people but there had been no reports of an orca being sighted in Tampa bay or surroundings. https://www.tampabay.com/hurricane/2022/09/28/hurricane-ian-drenches-tampa-bay-pounds-fort-myers-with-historic-fury/ When we enlarged the image, we were able to understand that the image has been manipulated. After searching for the viral image using Google reverse image search, we found that the same image was viral in the year 2020 also, when Miami was flooded. When searched further, we found the original image of the orca shared by Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society towards protection of oceans. Therefore, the image shared is a modified one with the orca picture added into the flooded streets. The original photograph does not show the orca on a flooded street in Tampa Bay, or a flooded street in Dallas, or in Miami. The claim is FALSE. The newly formed TDP–led government launched the distribution of enhanced social security pension to senior citizens. The pension was increased from Rs 3000 to Rs 4000 under the government’s NTR Bharosa Scheme. Meanwhile, a video of a bulldozer destroying the roadside cart of a street vendor is in circulation with the claim that the newly formed TDP government is destroying livelihood by using bulldozers. The old government had given 10,000 rupees to small businessmen as an investment and supported them financially. The claim in Telugu goes: “జగనన్న ప్రభుత్వం చిరు వ్యాపారులకు పెట్టుబడి కింద 10,000 ఇస్తూ ఆర్ధికంగా తోడుగా ఉంటే.. ఇప్పటి చంద్రబాబు ప్రభుత్వం అండగా ఉండకపోగా ఏకంగా బుల్డోజర్తో వాళ్ళ జీవనోపాధిపై కొడుతుంది.” With the hastags like #TDPantipoor The claim is viral on Facebook as well as on X (Twitter) The claim is False. The viral video is not from the state of Andhra Pradesh. When we observed carefully, we found that the language spoken in the viral video is Tamil and not Telugu. When we searched the extracted keyframes from the video using the Google reverse image tool, we found that the same video was published on some YouTube channels on July 1, 2024. The video was published on a YouTube channel named SoSouth on July 1, 2024, with the title “Officials Crackdown On Street Vendors In Chennai; Use JCB To Remove Roadside Carts| Sosouth “ Another YouTube channel named MCT News published the same video on July 1, 2024, with the description: The highway department's crackdown on street vendors to clear roadside carts has left many vendors in distress in Chennai. The officials used an excavator to crush and remove the carts in an effort to reduce traffic congestion in Tambaram. Visuals of the excavator destroying carts surfaced on social media, showing the machine's claw arm dropping onto a pushcart and damaging its top part before pushing it aside. According to a report published on India Today, the Officials belonging to highway department crackdown on street vendors to clear roadside carts has left many vendors in distress in Chennai. This incident occurred in Tambaram, Chennai. Visuals of excavators destroying carts surfaced on social media showing a machine’s claw arm dropping onto the pushcart and damaging it. Hence, the viral video showing a bulldozer destroying roadside carts of street vendors is not from Andhra Pradesh. It is from Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The claim is False. A video clip circulating on social media shows Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi saying, \"Jo log apne aap ko Hindu kehte hain, woh log 24 ghante kehte rehte hain hinsa, hinsa, hinsa.\" When translated, it means, \"Those who call themselves Hindu are busy with violence 24 hours a day.\" This video is shared by social media users with the caption: “Firoz Khan's grandson is abusing Hindus so much after getting only 99 seats. Imagine what this traitor will do to the Hindus if he gets the majority.... ! Another user shared a bit longer version a 17-sec video with the caption “Rahul Gandhi is saying “Jo Log apne aako Hindu kehtehain who log 24 ghante kehte rehte hain Hinsa Hinsa Hinsa… Nafrat Nafrat … Asatya, Asatya, Asatya. . . \" , when translated, it claims “ Those people who called themselves as Hindus, speak about violence, hate and lies 24 hours…” We have also seen that various politicians reacted on this issue with different captions. Union Minister of Health & Family welfare J.P Nadda shared on his social media “Rahul Gandhi Ji must immediately APOLOGISE to all Hindus for terming them as violent. This is the same person who was telling foreign diplomats that Hindus are terrorists. This intrinsic hate towards Hindus must stop. BJP State president of UP Bhupendra Singh Choudhry also shared the video with the text: “Anti-Hindu side of Rahul Gandhi revealed inside the Parliament”. Fact Check: We found the claim is Misleading, an edited clip is shared on social media. During the search, we found a video uploaded on Rahul Gandhi YouTube Channel in which at exact 20.05 time stamp, Rahul says: \"Lord Shiva ... [Content truncated]",
