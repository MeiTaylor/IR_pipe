But an A.P. analysis and experts say a wayward finned creature was indeed captured on video swimming on a street in Fort Myers, Fla., this week.\nBy Daniel Victor\nTo professional fact-checkers who sort fact from fable on social media, Hurricane Shark has been a longtime nemesis.\nFor more than a decade, fake, grainy images of a shark swimming in waters it doesn\u2019t belong in \u2014 usually a highway and a subway platform \u2014 have reliably circulated during nearly every major storm.\nIt was never real. Yet it kept coming up, shared without skepticism yet again, and the checkers of facts were forced to defeat it again, over and over.\nSo you can imagine their hesitant surprise when a new video emerged on Wednesday appearing to show a shark in a backyard near Fort Myers, Fla., which had been battered by Hurricane Ian and was beginning to flood. Though this video didn\u2019t have the telltale signs of fakery that previous versions did, skepticism was warranted as it racked up millions of views on Twitter.\nThen evidence began emerging that it might actually be real. And on Thursday, both Storyful, a news agency, and The Associated Press confirmed its authenticity with interviews and examinations of the original clip\u2019s metadata, nailing down a story reporters thought they would never write.\nIt was like discovering Bigfoot is real.\n\u201cAfter over half a decade of debunking this hoax every time there was a flood or hurricane, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m looking at an honest-to-god street shark,\u201d wrote Jane Lytvynenko, a freelance reporter. \u201cGood to finally meet you, pal.\u201d\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

For years both journalists and shark scientists have had to put up with the deluge of fake images and videos, telling the public the same message: \u201cthis is fake.\u201d In fact, even the Twitter page for Snopes has begged people to stop sharing the proven false photos and videos. So, it was to no one\u2019s surprise when a video popped up after Hurricane Ian made landfall in Florida claiming to capture a shark in floodwaters.\nThis video, however, was different.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,\u201d Cameratta told news outlets. ... [+] \u201cI zoomed in, and all my friends are like: \u2018It\u2019s like a shark, man!\u2019\u201d\nPast hoax videos usually showed sharks in flooded malls or swimming down highways, but this one seemed to be in someone\u2019s backyard near Fort Myers, Florida. The fact that this was a new video garnered a lot of attention, racking up millions of views on Twitter. The skepticism was rampant \u2013 and warranted. The first question many asked was, \u201cIs this an actual video?\u201d An answer quickly came with both Storyful and The Associated Press confirming its authenticity through examination of the video\u2019s metadata and subsequent interviews. AP got the scoop from local real estate agent Dominic Cameratta, who confirmed he filmed the clip himself on Wednesday morning. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,\u201d he told news outlets. \u201cI zoomed in, and all my friends are like: \u2018It\u2019s like a shark, man!\u2019\u201d\nSo, the clip is real. But is that really a shark?\nIt\u2019s hard to tell \u2013 and even shark scientists are stumped. George Burgess, a former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History\u2019s shark program, told the Washington Post that the fish in the video appears to be a juvenile shark. \u201cYoung bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters \u2014 rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments \u2014 and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,\u201d Burgess said. \u201cAssuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.\u201d\n\u201cYoung bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters \u2014 rivers, estuaries, subtropical ... [+] embayments \u2014 and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,\u201d Burgess says.\nDr. Yannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, is on the fence about the video. Papastamatiou pointed to the science that shows many shark species are known to flee shallow, coastal regions ahead of hurricanes, possibly being tipped off to the giant storm\u2019s arrival by a drastic change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he reckons, or been washed into it.\nBut Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami\u2019s shark conservation program, isn\u2019t as convinced, saying it was difficult to tell what exactly the fish was. It should be of note that the video caught the fish swimming near a pond that was overflowing, causing some experts to lean towards this just being an escapee.\nIt seems we will never have a definitive answer to this mystery. While shark experts are split over the identification, some Twitter users were convinced and have dubbed the grainy fish a \u201cstreet shark.\u201d Perhaps this is a new rendition for \u201cBaby Shark\u201d writers to pick up and write a song about?\n\nOne Community.

If you have a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer, send it to curiouskidsus@theconversation.com. How can I tell if what I am hearing is true? \u2013 Adam, age 10, Maui, Hawaii Have you ever heard a story so exciting you wanted to share it right away? Something like a shark swimming up a flooded highway? An image that seems to show just that was shared by many people after Hurricane Ian struck Florida in 2022. It was also widely shared after Hurricane Harvey hit Houston, Texas, in 2017. It\u2019s a fake \u2013 a flooded highway image combined with one of a great white shark. The fact-checking website Snopes found it circulating as far back as 2011 after Hurricane Irene slammed Puerto Rico. Truth can be tricky to determine. Every message you read, see or hear comes from somewhere and was created by someone and for someone. I teach media literacy, which is a way to think about information you get in the messages you receive via media. You might think media means the news, but it also includes TikTok posts, television, books, advertisements and more. When deciding whether to trust a piece of information, it\u2019s good to start with three main questions \u2013 who said it, what evidence did they give and how much do you want to believe it? The last one might seem a little strange, but you\u2019ll see why it\u2019s important by the end. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re really excited about a game that\u2019s coming out later this year. You want to be the first to learn about the new creatures, characters and game modes. So when a YouTube video pops up saying, \u201cGAME COMING TWO WEEKS EARLY,\u201d you can\u2019t wait to watch. But when you click, it\u2019s just a guy making predictions. Do you trust him? A source is where information comes from. You get information from sources every day \u2013 from teachers, parents and friends to people you\u2019ve never met on news sites, fan channels and social media. You probably have sources you trust and ones you don\u2019t. But why? Would you trust your history teacher to tell you something about history? Probably, because they have a college degree that says they know their stuff. But what if your history teacher told you a fact about science your science teacher said was untrue? You\u2019d probably be better off going with the science teacher for your science facts. Just because a source is trustworthy in one subject doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re trustworthy in every subject. Let\u2019s go back to the YouTuber. If you\u2019ve watched him for a while and he\u2019s reliably correct, that\u2019s a good start. At the same time, make sure you don\u2019t confuse his having an opinion with actually having knowledge. Just because you like a source doesn\u2019t make it trustworthy. This is true for websites, too. When a site grabs your attention, take a second to check the source at the top. Some fake sites use names that sound trustworthy \u2013 like \u201cBoston Tribune\u201d instead of \u201cBoston Globe\u201d or \u201cwww.cbs.com.co\u201d instead of \u201cwww.cbs.com.\u201d You can click the \u201cAbout\u201d page to see where they\u2019re really coming from, use lists of known fake sites and other fact-checking resources to avoid getting played. Evidence is what you show when someone says \u201cprove it!\u201d It\u2019s the details that support what a source is saying. Primary sources \u2013 people or groups who are directly involved with the information \u2013 are best. If you want to learn about the release of a new game, the company\u2019s official accounts or channels would be primary sources. Secondary sources are one step removed \u2013 for example, news stories based on primary sources. They aren\u2019t as strong as primary sources but are still useful. For example, most news on gaming site IGN is based on information from game company sources, so it\u2019s a good secondary source. Can a blogger or YouTuber be a secondary source? If their claims start by referencing primary sources like \u201cElectronic Arts says,\u201d that\u2019s good. But if they start with \u201cI think\u201d or \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of buzz,\u201d be careful. Emotions can get in the way of knowing what\u2019s true. Messages that make you feel strong emotions \u2013 especially ones that are funny or make you angry \u2013 are the most important ones to check, but they\u2019re also the hardest to ignore. Advertisers know this. Many ads try to be funny or make the things they\u2019re selling look cool because they want you to focus on how you feel rather than what you think. And being older doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re automatically better at spotting false information: 41% of 18-to-34-year-olds and 44% of adults 65 and older admitted to having fallen for a fake news story in a 2018 study. Other research showed adults over 65 were seven times as likely to share articles from fake sites as younger people were. So if you\u2019ve been eagerly waiting for that new game, and somebody posts a video that says it\u2019s coming out early, your wanting it to be true can make you ignore your common sense \u2013 leaving you open to being fooled. The best question you can ask yourself when you\u2019re thinking about a message is, \u201cDo I want to believe this?\u201d If the answer is yes, it\u2019s a good sign you should slow down and check the source and evidence more closely. Hello, curious kids! Do you have a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer? Ask an adult to send your question to CuriousKidsUS@theconversation.com.

                    "content": "Please enable JavaScript in your web browser to get the best experience. Tom Johansmeyer Published 20 February 2023 The weaponisation of information is nothing new. Foreign influence operations involving Brexit and the 2016 U.S. presidential election are recent high-profile examples of a much larger problem. The targeted use of information operations has permeated society and will only grow with time. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not our only problem. Thanks to climate change, more natural disasters are coming, and they\u2019re becoming more powerful and more impactful. The disaster-disinformation nexus offers unique conditions for powerful and frequent influence campaigns against communities at their most vulnerable. And while this hasn\u2019t been a large problem yet, indicators of its coming abound. People seek stability and reliability during periods of uncertainty, and they will often take anything that looks helpful, seems to make sense, or otherwise fills a void. Absent the perfect, it seems, anything will suffice. Consequently, disinformation is common following major natural disasters. The rise of social media makes it easier for convenient \u2013 if not true \u2013 information to spread rapidly and take on a life of its own. Although the rumour and fiction that forms and spread after a natural disaster can often be harmless, there are cases where disinformation can impede rescue and relief efforts. Before turning to the grave, let\u2019s consider the absurd. Hurricane Irma, in 2017, reportedly led to the displacement of sharks onto a Florida highway. The same story \u2013 and image \u2013 made the rounds after Hurricanes Harvey and Florence. Hurricane sharks are as common as they are false. The risk of highway sharks may not be terribly significant, especially if highways are so flooded as to be unusable. The thought of sharks on the interstate is good for a laugh \u2013 and moment of reflection on what people will actually believe. Unfortunately, though, there is a dark side to disaster information. False and inaccurate reports can impede rescue and relief efforts cost people their lives. This happened in the Indian state of Kerala in 2018. Fake video circulated during the flooding event interfered with rescue operations. Fake news in Mali disrupted United Nations missions, and in 2005, exaggerated reports of looting and other violence interfered with Hurricane Katrina response efforts. Preparations and planning are already being discussed for ways to counteract the growing post-disaster disinformation threat. Fake news has real-world consequences, and the stakes are about to go up. Historical cases of disaster-related disinformation generally have been more grassroots than from outside influence and state actors, but that\u2019s about to change. Foreign influence operations have already been deployed to considerable effect during periods of vulnerability generally, if not disasters specifically \u2013 from elections to civil unrest. The increasing cadence of major natural disasters due to climate change could offer more opportunities for the weaponization of foreign influence, especially when communities are weakened and local institutions are strained. Let\u2019s go back to those hurricane sharks. The disinformation that circulated online following the 2017 and 2018 hurricanes appears simply to have been a hoax \u2013 just a manipulated video of sharks swimming on the highway. Hurricane Ian brought that same shark to Fort Myers, Florida, in 2022. This time, coverage appeared in Sputnik News (Warning: Not a credible source of information, linked here), a known foreign government-sponsored source of disinformation. Beyond the highway sharks, Sputnik News sought to advance a narrative of ineffective government response following the hurricane (Warning, not credible, linked here), a clear case of post-disaster foreign influence, even if on a small scale. The weaponization of post-disaster disinformation and influence isn\u2019t limited to the Gulf of Mexico. It\u2019s a worldwide problem. Foreign influence has found traction with the drought in currently in Moldova, with foreign influence used to create wedges between semi-autonomous regions Transnistria and Gagauzia and the government in Chisinau. News coverage critical of the country\u2019s government is using issues such as economic and energy insecurity to foment civil unrest in a part of the world already experiencing destabilization. The disaster-disinformation nexus in Moldova may seem too small to follow closely \u2013 the country has only 3 million people \u2013 but global effects could follow. Today\u2019s interference could support the development of a playbook for post-disaster disinformation and influence, adding scale to this budding problem. The world\u2019s disinformation plague is vast and complex, defying simple, direct, and easily implemented solutions. Within the disaster-disinformation nexus, however, it may be more manageable. Specific, contextually relevant steps can be taken to curb the impact of disinformation and foreign influence on communities affected by natural disasters. And frankly, there\u2019s no substitute for real life. Consider the Sputnik News story alleging that the government had abandoned the victims of Hurricane Ian. The situation on the ground was clearly far different from the allegation. Rebuilding a community (even a household) after a disaster is a trying time, but there is a lot of mileage between challenging circumstances and government abandonment. Relief supplies and professionals were engaged as soon as possible to help effect a swift and orderly recovery. A strong disaster response plan may not be enough to neutralise disinformation after a natural disaster, but it certainly makes a difference. Access to basic necessities and visual proof of progress makes it much harder for the trolls to do their job. *The views expressed herein are those of the author, based on research conducted by the author, and may not necessarily represent the views of others unless otherwise noted.
