It was also widely shared after Hurricane Harvey hit Houston, Texas, in 2017. It\u2019s a fake \u2013 a flooded highway image combined with one of a great white shark. The fact-checking website Snopes found it circulating as far back as 2011 after Hurricane Irene slammed Puerto Rico. Truth can be tricky to determine. Every message you read, see or hear comes from somewhere and was created by someone and for someone. I teach media literacy, which is a way to think about information you get in the messages you receive via media. You might think media means the news, but it also includes TikTok posts, television, books, advertisements and more. When deciding whether to trust a piece of information, it\u2019s good to start with three main questions \u2013 who said it, what evidence did they give and how much do you want to believe it? The last one might seem a little strange, but you\u2019ll see why it\u2019s important by the end. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re really excited about a game that\u2019s coming out later this year. You want to be the first to learn about the new creatures, characters and game modes. So when a YouTube video pops up saying, \u201cGAME COMING TWO WEEKS EARLY,\u201d you can\u2019t wait to watch. But when you click, it\u2019s just a guy making predictions. Do you trust him? A source is where information comes from. You get information from sources every day \u2013 from teachers, parents and friends to people you\u2019ve never met on news sites, fan channels and social media. You probably have sources you trust and ones you don\u2019t. But why? Would you trust your history teacher to tell you something about history? Probably, because they have a college degree that says they know their stuff. But what if your history teacher told you a fact about science your science teacher said was untrue? You\u2019d probably be better off going with the science teacher for your science facts. Just because a source is trustworthy in one subject doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re trustworthy in every subject. Let\u2019s go back to the YouTuber. If you\u2019ve watched him for a while and he\u2019s reliably correct, that\u2019s a good start. At the same time, make sure you don\u2019t confuse his having an opinion with actually having knowledge. Just because you like a source doesn\u2019t make it trustworthy. This is true for websites, too. When a site grabs your attention, take a second to check the source at the top. Some fake sites use names that sound trustworthy \u2013 like \u201cBoston Tribune\u201d instead of \u201cBoston Globe\u201d or \u201cwww.cbs.com.co\u201d instead of \u201cwww.cbs.com.\u201d You can click the \u201cAbout\u201d page to see where they\u2019re really coming from, use lists of known fake sites and other fact-checking resources to avoid getting played. Evidence is what you show when someone says \u201cprove it!\u201d It\u2019s the details that support what a source is saying. Primary sources \u2013 people or groups who are directly involved with the information \u2013 are best. If you want to learn about the release of a new game, the company\u2019s official accounts or channels would be primary sources. Secondary sources are one step removed \u2013 for example, news stories based on primary sources. They aren\u2019t as strong as primary sources but are still useful. For example, most news on gaming site IGN is based on information from game company sources, so it\u2019s a good secondary source. Can a blogger or YouTuber be a secondary source? If their claims start by referencing primary sources like \u201cElectronic Arts says,\u201d that\u2019s good. But if they start with \u201cI think\u201d or \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of buzz,\u201d be careful. Emotions can get in the way of knowing what\u2019s true. Messages that make you feel strong emotions \u2013 especially ones that are funny or make you angry \u2013 are the most important ones to check, but they\u2019re also the hardest to ignore. Advertisers know this. Many ads try to be funny or make the things they\u2019re selling look cool because they want you to focus on how you feel rather than what you think. And being older doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re automatically better at spotting false information: 41% of 18-to-34-year-olds and 44% of adults 65 and older admitted to having fallen for a fake news story in a 2018 study. Other research showed adults over 65 were seven times as likely to share articles from fake sites as younger people were. So if you\u2019ve been eagerly waiting for that new game, and somebody posts a video that says it\u2019s coming out early, your wanting it to be true can make you ignore your common sense \u2013 leaving you open to being fooled. The best question you can ask yourself when you\u2019re thinking about a message is, \u201cDo I want to believe this?\u201d If the answer is yes, it\u2019s a good sign you should slow down and check the source and evidence more closely.

                    "content": "When Hurricane Nicole hit Florida on Wednesday night with wind, rain and flooding battering the state, a common hoax resurfaced. A video of fin-like objects being swept down a flooded road on the Sunshine State's east coast sparked a joke that the objects were two sharks carried through the streets by the rushing water.\nThe Category 1 storm hit the coast that was already vulnerable from Hurricane Ian, which hammered the state six weeks ago. Residents were urged to evacuate in certain areas as floodwaters cascaded down roadways. As residents were evacuating, one video shows a car stopped at a flooded intersection and debris carried by the floodwaters rushing through the intersection.\nThe Instagram video, posted by user ohana_surf_shop on Wednesday morning, showed two fin-like objects swept along by floodwaters near an intersection where the user was stopped in his car. The video taker joked, \"There goes a shark, we've got a couple sharks,\" as the objects floated by. Another person in the car laughed during the video.\nThe post's caption said, \"Sharks on the streets!!\" and included hashtags for \"Sharknado,\" a made-for-TV science fiction comedy disaster movie that is commonly referenced when shark hoaxes resurface during hurricanes.\nStoryful, a social media intelligence agency, shared the video and said it was taken by Jordan Schwartz, a local man who owns Ohana Surf Shop in Stuart, Florida.\nThe video was taken after residents received evacuation orders when storm surges breached the coast and flooding overwhelmed local streets. Schwartz also recorded more debris transported by floodwaters down the roadway, including a kayak.\nSchwartz told Newsweek that at first, the debris did look like sharks.\n\"It looks real all the way through,\" he said in an Instagram message. \"So we were kinda in shock and [definitely] thought we had sharks at the beginning.\"\nSchwartz said that as soon as the debris floated past the car in front of him, he realized it wasn't a shark. He said he wasn't aware of the common shark hoaxes that surface during hurricanes when he took the video.\n\"Actually amazed how much feedback we got from this,\" he said.\nSchwartz shared the video twice on his Instagram page. The first was liked nearly 3,900 times and the second nearly 3,000 times.\nShark appearances are common hoaxes that originated in 2012 when a fake image of a shark was depicted swimming down a flooded highway. Since then, the image and others have surfaced on social media whenever a hurricane hits.\nMost recently, a man videoed what appeared to be a shark flopping around in his neighbor's backyard in Fort Myers, Florida, during severe storm surge from Hurricane Ian.\nAfter the video index was confirmed, experts said it's possible that a shark sensed a drop in barometric pressure that preceded the hurricane and, trying to flee, accidentally ended up in a retention pond which, when flooded, tossed the shark into someone's backyard. Storyful, a social media intelligence agency, verified the Fort Myers video was authentic but couldn't determine if the animal was actually a shark or a large fish.\nThe Hurricane Ian shark is an anomaly, and many shark-like objects sighted during hurricanes are later determined to be debris or fake images.\nUpdate 11/10/22, 11:04 a.m. ET: This story was updated with comment from Jordan Schwartz.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nAnna Skinner is a Newsweek senior reporter based in Indianapolis.

                    "content": "It's common for hoax photos and videos of sharks swimming in flooded streets to surface during hurricanes and they're often quickly debunked. But a new video of a shark in Hurricane Ian's storm surge has people thinking it is the real deal. Hurricane Ian slammed into Florida on Wednesday as a Category 4 hurricane with winds just a few miles per hour away from bumping the classification up to a Category 5. The hurricane resulted in a massive storm surge, and that surge appeared to have pushed a shark into a flooded street in Fort Myers, Florida. While some Twitter users tried to take credit for the video or said they got the video from a friend, the Associated Press has confirmed the video was authentic after speaking with the person who filmed the shark struggling to swim in his backyard. According to the AP report, Dominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer who said he filmed the video Wednesday morning, filmed the shark from his back patio when he saw it flopping around in his neighbor's backyard. Cameratta said at first, he thought the animal was a large fish but soon realized it was a shark. He estimated the shark to be 4 feet long. Cameratta lives near a retention pond, and he said he assumed the shark made it up Hendry Creek and into the pond. The pond then overflowed from storm surge and heavy rain, transporting the shark into the flooded backyard. Some experts told AP they thought the shark looked to be a juvenile. Twitter user THE Alex shared the video at approximately 10 a.m. on Wednesday. The video shows what appears to be a shark flopping around in an apparently flooded street. The animal in the video is seen thrashing its tail back and forth as winds gust in the background. \"My buddy just sent me a video of this shark swimming down his back yard in Fort Myers,\" THE Alex tweeted Wednesday. My buddy just sent me a video of this this shark swimming down his back yard in Fort Myers \ud83d\ude02#hurricane #Ian #HurricaneIan pic.twitter.com/kLon2z3F8Q Leslie Guelcher, an assistant professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University who goes by Dr. G on Twitter, was one of the people who questioned the video's authenticity. Prior to AP's verification, Guelcher tweeted that the video index showed a creation date of June 2010. She later told Newsweek she misread the index data, but she is unconvinced the video is real because the video was taken before the storm surge rose in earnest in Fort Myers. \"I'm still not convinced it is accurate although the person who commented provided the name of who filmed it and where,\" Guelcher said. \"However, a reverse image search on Google, limiting to site:Twitter.com shows a number of posts with at least one being from before the storm surge hit.\" She later said she could see how a shark could go from the Gulf of Mexico into a retention pond. However, some experts expect the shark may have sensed a drop in barometric pressure signifying the approaching hurricane. It may have attempted to flee shallow waters to somewhere safer. However, the shark could have accidentally entered the creek and then the pond in its attempts to flee, or flooding could have forced the animal into the residential area. The video's confirmation was the culmination of five years of searching for Jane Lytvynenko, a freelance reporter who has spent years debunking hoaxes. Before the video was confirmed as real, Lytvynenko implied it had credibility. \"I can't believe I'm looking at an honest-to-god street shark,\" Lytvynenko tweeted. \"Good to finally meet you, pal.\" After over half a decade of debunking this hoax every time there was a flood or hurricane, I can't believe I'm looking at an honest-to-god street shark.Good to finally meet you, pal. https://t.co/hwMWX4Peqo Shark hoaxes have emerged in many hurricanes since a fake image of a shark swimming through a flooded highway was first posted in 2012. Social media agency Storyful also verified the video was authentic but couldn't confirm if the footage showed a small shark or a different fish, such as a cobia. Florida officials warned residents that some wildlife might emerge during the storm, namely bears, alligators and snakes, as wildlife becomes more active and disoriented during massive storms. Newsweek reached out to Florida Fish and Wildlife for comment. Update 9/30/2022 11:15 a.m. ET: This story has been updated with additional information.

                    "content": "Michel Martin NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Lesley Cosme Torres, who reports on disinformation for The Miami Herald, about misinformation circulating online in the wake of Hurricane Ian. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: As in any other moment of crisis, many of us have taken to the internet to try to understand or process the scale of the destruction left in the wake of Hurricane Ian. Along with videos of sharks swimming in the streets, memes have exploded on social media. And some of them are bizarre, and some of them are even funny. But there are also many spreading lies and misinformation. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has specifically warned residents across the state to be on the lookout against potential financial scams that often seem to follow the paths of disasters. Here he is talking about that.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RON DESANTIS: And it just hasn't worked out well in the past in Florida. Unfortunately, when you have disasters, there are some people that want to prey on people when they're in vulnerable situations, and we do not want that.MARTIN: To talk about these meme scams and misinformation, we're joined now by Lesley Cosme Torres. She is a reporter who reports on misinformation and disinformation in Spanish for The Miami Herald. Lesley Cosme Torres, welcome. Thanks so much for talking to us.LESLEY COSME TORRES: Yeah, thanks so much for having me.MARTIN: I'd like to start off by asking about some of the things that we've seen online. There's this video circulating on the internet. It has over 13 million views now. It shows what seems to be a baby shark swimming along a Florida highway. In a few memes, we see alligators wading in floodwaters inside people's homes. Is there a way that we can know which images are real and which are fake?COSME TORRES: The thing with memes and old videos resurfacing is oftentimes when people browse through social media, it's pretty casually and passively, meaning that even if it's the same video of the shark that reappeared in 2016, like, people don't take the time to realize that it's old. We don't really take the time to know where the posts originated and what year. And for someone who's more inclined to believe in conspiracies and misinformation, they won't look in - or research if it's real.But it's not an issue of, like, people not believing it. It's that people don't have time to fact-check everything they see on social media. So it's always important to look at the origin of the video. See how far back you can trace it. And it's also important to look to two to three trusted sources to see if they've reported on it or if they've debunked it because sources like PolitiFact and Poynter, they fact-check these things. And they'll say on their websites, like, hey, this thing that spreading, it's not real. So that's always a good thing to do.MARTIN: What about memes? I think it's interesting to a lot of people how quickly memes pop up after something like this. And as I said, you know, some of them are bizarre, and some of them are funny. What do you think about that?COSME TORRES: Yeah. I think, like, memes and posts that resurface can be harmful in cases of hurricanes because hurricanes in Florida can have really devastating impacts, from people's own personal safety to really important items like their houses, their cars, their entire life. So when a hurricane comes, the trajectory isn't always certain. So people are sort of, like, glued to social media - myself included - like, local news sites, TV, to keep track of where it's going, like, what kind of impact it's had. So if you're out there spreading misinformation or sharing a video that actually happened, like, three years ago, five years ago, it can cause a panic. It can make - it can lead people to make rash and quick decisions that they wouldn't if they had the right information from trusted sources.MARTIN: Oh, I see what you're saying. So you're saying that while people may think they're just spreading something fun or they're just being creative or whimsical, you're saying that this can actually be really harmful because it's distracting people from the accurate, real-time information they need to make good decisions.COSME TORRES: Exactly. In English, these posts - like, they'll eventually be taken down if they're on popular websites like Twitter and Facebook. It's just important, I guess, to - you yourself, as a user, you can be a part of solutions. So, like, if you see something that looks fishy or you see something that you know isn't true, you can report it and save a lot of harm that it can cause because it might be, like, a cute meme for someone who doesn't live in Florida. But, like, there are people who are, like, severely impacted by these hurricanes. And it's important that they know exactly what's going on.MARTIN: As we heard earlier, the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, has warned people of financial scams that prey on people who are affected by storms and, you know, prey on people - they prey on people wanting to help people who have been affected by disasters. Are there some tips that you can share to help people - to prevent people from falling prey to these scams?COSME TORRES: Yeah. So it's really important to realize that when someone is asking you for your personal information or for money, it's most likely an imposter scam or someone who's using this horrible incident to get money from you - posing as the government, officials or inspectors, someone who's asking to see your ID or personal information. So no one should ever ask you for - no one should ever, from a number you don't know, ask you for that information. And FEMA, for example, doesn't charge application fees or anything like that. So it's always important to see, just to make sure ... [Content truncated]",
