If you have a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer, send it to curiouskidsus@theconversation.com. How can I tell if what I am hearing is true? \u2013 Adam, age 10, Maui, Hawaii Have you ever heard a story so exciting you wanted to share it right away? Something like a shark swimming up a flooded highway? An image that seems to show just that was shared by many people after Hurricane Ian struck Florida in 2022. It was also widely shared after Hurricane Harvey hit Houston, Texas, in 2017. It\u2019s a fake \u2013 a flooded highway image combined with one of a great white shark. The fact-checking website Snopes found it circulating as far back as 2011 after Hurricane Irene slammed Puerto Rico. Truth can be tricky to determine. Every message you read, see or hear comes from somewhere and was created by someone and for someone. I teach media literacy, which is a way to think about information you get in the messages you receive via media. You might think media means the news, but it also includes TikTok posts, television, books, advertisements and more. When deciding whether to trust a piece of information, it\u2019s good to start with three main questions \u2013 who said it, what evidence did they give and how much do you want to believe it? The last one might seem a little strange, but you\u2019ll see why it\u2019s important by the end. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re really excited about a game that\u2019s coming out later this year. You want to be the first to learn about the new creatures, characters and game modes. So when a YouTube video pops up saying, \u201cGAME COMING TWO WEEKS EARLY,\u201d you can\u2019t wait to watch. But when you click, it\u2019s just a guy making predictions. Do you trust him? A source is where information comes from. You get information from sources every day \u2013 from teachers, parents and friends to people you\u2019ve never met on news sites, fan channels and social media. You probably have sources you trust and ones you don\u2019t. But why? Would you trust your history teacher to tell you something about history? Probably, because they have a college degree that says they know their stuff. But what if your history teacher told you a fact about science your science teacher said was untrue? You\u2019d probably be better off going with the science teacher for your science facts. Just because a source is trustworthy in one subject doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re trustworthy in every subject. Let\u2019s go back to the YouTuber. If you\u2019ve watched him for a while and he\u2019s reliably correct, that\u2019s a good start. At the same time, make sure you don\u2019t confuse his having an opinion with actually having knowledge. Just because you like a source doesn\u2019t make it trustworthy. This is true for websites, too. When a site grabs your attention, take a second to check the source at the top. Some fake sites use names that sound trustworthy \u2013 like \u201cBoston Tribune\u201d instead of \u201cBoston Globe\u201d or \u201cwww.cbs.com.co\u201d instead of \u201cwww.cbs.com.\u201d You can click the \u201cAbout\u201d page to see where they\u2019re really coming from, use lists of known fake sites and other fact-checking resources to avoid getting played. Evidence is what you show when someone says \u201cprove it!\u201d It\u2019s the details that support what a source is saying. Primary sources \u2013 people or groups who are directly involved with the information \u2013 are best. If you want to learn about the release of a new game, the company\u2019s official accounts or channels would be primary sources. Secondary sources are one step removed \u2013 for example, news stories based on primary sources. They aren\u2019t as strong as primary sources but are still useful. For example, most news on gaming site IGN is based on information from game company sources, so it\u2019s a good secondary source. Can a blogger or YouTuber be a secondary source? If their claims start by referencing primary sources like \u201cElectronic Arts says,\u201d that\u2019s good. But if they start with \u201cI think\u201d or \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of buzz,\u201d be careful. Emotions can get in the way of knowing what\u2019s true. Messages that make you feel strong emotions \u2013 especially ones that are funny or make you angry \u2013 are the most important ones to check, but they\u2019re also the hardest to ignore. Advertisers know this. Many ads try to be funny or make the things they\u2019re selling look cool because they want you to focus on how you feel rather than what you think. And being older doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re automatically better at spotting false information: 41% of 18-to-34-year-olds and 44% of adults 65 and older admitted to having fallen for a fake news story in a 2018 study. Other research showed adults over 65 were seven times as likely to share articles from fake sites as younger people were. So if you\u2019ve been eagerly waiting for that new game, and somebody posts a video that says it\u2019s coming out early, your wanting it to be true can make you ignore your common sense \u2013 leaving you open to being fooled. The best question you can ask yourself when you\u2019re thinking about a message is, \u201cDo I want to believe this?\u201d If the answer is yes, it\u2019s a good sign you should slow down and check the source and evidence more closely.

For years both journalists and shark scientists have had to put up with the deluge of fake images and videos, telling the public the same message: \u201cthis is fake.\u201d In fact, even the Twitter page for Snopes has begged people to stop sharing the proven false photos and videos. So, it was to no one\u2019s surprise when a video popped up after Hurricane Ian made landfall in Florida claiming to capture a shark in floodwaters.\nThis video, however, was different.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,\u201d Cameratta told news outlets. ... [+] \u201cI zoomed in, and all my friends are like: \u2018It\u2019s like a shark, man!\u2019\u201d\nPast hoax videos usually showed sharks in flooded malls or swimming down highways, but this one seemed to be in someone\u2019s backyard near Fort Myers, Florida. The fact that this was a new video garnered a lot of attention, racking up millions of views on Twitter. The skepticism was rampant \u2013 and warranted. The first question many asked was, \u201cIs this an actual video?\u201d An answer quickly came with both Storyful and The Associated Press confirming its authenticity through examination of the video\u2019s metadata and subsequent interviews. AP got the scoop from local real estate agent Dominic Cameratta, who confirmed he filmed the clip himself on Wednesday morning. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,\u201d he told news outlets. \u201cI zoomed in, and all my friends are like: \u2018It\u2019s like a shark, man!\u2019\u201d\nSo, the clip is real. But is that really a shark?\nIt\u2019s hard to tell \u2013 and even shark scientists are stumped. George Burgess, a former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History\u2019s shark program, told the Washington Post that the fish in the video appears to be a juvenile shark. \u201cYoung bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters \u2014 rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments \u2014 and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,\u201d Burgess said. \u201cAssuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.\u201d\n\u201cYoung bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters \u2014 rivers, estuaries, subtropical ... [+] embayments \u2014 and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,\u201d Burgess says.\nDr. Yannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, is on the fence about the video. Papastamatiou pointed to the science that shows many shark species are known to flee shallow, coastal regions ahead of hurricanes, possibly being tipped off to the giant storm\u2019s arrival by a drastic change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he reckons, or been washed into it.\nBut Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami\u2019s shark conservation program, isn\u2019t as convinced, saying it was difficult to tell what exactly the fish was. It should be of note that the video caught the fish swimming near a pond that was overflowing, causing some experts to lean towards this just being an escapee.\nIt seems we will never have a definitive answer to this mystery. While shark experts are split over the identification, some Twitter users were convinced and have dubbed the grainy fish a \u201cstreet shark.\u201d Perhaps this is a new rendition for \u201cBaby Shark\u201d writers to pick up and write a song about?\n\nOne Community.

                    "content": "Please enable JavaScript in your web browser to get the best experience. Tom Johansmeyer Published 20 February 2023 The weaponisation of information is nothing new. Foreign influence operations involving Brexit and the 2016 U.S. presidential election are recent high-profile examples of a much larger problem. The targeted use of information operations has permeated society and will only grow with time. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not our only problem. Thanks to climate change, more natural disasters are coming, and they\u2019re becoming more powerful and more impactful. The disaster-disinformation nexus offers unique conditions for powerful and frequent influence campaigns against communities at their most vulnerable. And while this hasn\u2019t been a large problem yet, indicators of its coming abound. People seek stability and reliability during periods of uncertainty, and they will often take anything that looks helpful, seems to make sense, or otherwise fills a void. Absent the perfect, it seems, anything will suffice. Consequently, disinformation is common following major natural disasters. The rise of social media makes it easier for convenient \u2013 if not true \u2013 information to spread rapidly and take on a life of its own. Although the rumour and fiction that forms and spread after a natural disaster can often be harmless, there are cases where disinformation can impede rescue and relief efforts. Before turning to the grave, let\u2019s consider the absurd. Hurricane Irma, in 2017, reportedly led to the displacement of sharks onto a Florida highway. The same story \u2013 and image \u2013 made the rounds after Hurricanes Harvey and Florence. Hurricane sharks are as common as they are false. The risk of highway sharks may not be terribly significant, especially if highways are so flooded as to be unusable. The thought of sharks on the interstate is good for a laugh \u2013 and moment of reflection on what people will actually believe. Unfortunately, though, there is a dark side to disaster information. False and inaccurate reports can impede rescue and relief efforts cost people their lives. This happened in the Indian state of Kerala in 2018. Fake video circulated during the flooding event interfered with rescue operations. Fake news in Mali disrupted United Nations missions, and in 2005, exaggerated reports of looting and other violence interfered with Hurricane Katrina response efforts. Preparations and planning are already being discussed for ways to counteract the growing post-disaster disinformation threat. Fake news has real-world consequences, and the stakes are about to go up. Historical cases of disaster-related disinformation generally have been more grassroots than from outside influence and state actors, but that\u2019s about to change. Foreign influence operations have already been deployed to considerable effect during periods of vulnerability generally, if not disasters specifically \u2013 from elections to civil unrest. The increasing cadence of major natural disasters due to climate change could offer more opportunities for the weaponization of foreign influence, especially when communities are weakened and local institutions are strained. Let\u2019s go back to those hurricane sharks. The disinformation that circulated online following the 2017 and 2018 hurricanes appears simply to have been a hoax \u2013 just a manipulated video of sharks swimming on the highway. Hurricane Ian brought that same shark to Fort Myers, Florida, in 2022. This time, coverage appeared in Sputnik News (Warning: Not a credible source of information, linked here), a known foreign government-sponsored source of disinformation. Beyond the highway sharks, Sputnik News sought to advance a narrative of ineffective government response following the hurricane (Warning, not credible, linked here), a clear case of post-disaster foreign influence, even if on a small scale. The weaponization of post-disaster disinformation and influence isn\u2019t limited to the Gulf of Mexico. It\u2019s a worldwide problem. Foreign influence has found traction with the drought in currently in Moldova, with foreign influence used to create wedges between semi-autonomous regions Transnistria and Gagauzia and the government in Chisinau. News coverage critical of the country\u2019s government is using issues such as economic and energy insecurity to foment civil unrest in a part of the world already experiencing destabilization. The disaster-disinformation nexus in Moldova may seem too small to follow closely \u2013 the country has only 3 million people \u2013 but global effects could follow. Today\u2019s interference could support the development of a playbook for post-disaster disinformation and influence, adding scale to this budding problem. The world\u2019s disinformation plague is vast and complex, defying simple, direct, and easily implemented solutions. Within the disaster-disinformation nexus, however, it may be more manageable. Specific, contextually relevant steps can be taken to curb the impact of disinformation and foreign influence on communities affected by natural disasters. And frankly, there\u2019s no substitute for real life. Consider the Sputnik News story alleging that the government had abandoned the victims of Hurricane Ian. The situation on the ground was clearly far different from the allegation. Rebuilding a community (even a household) after a disaster is a trying time, but there is a lot of mileage between challenging circumstances and government abandonment. Relief supplies and professionals were engaged as soon as possible to help effect a swift and orderly recovery. A strong disaster response plan may not be enough to neutralise disinformation after a natural disaster, but it certainly makes a difference. Access to basic necessities and visual proof of progress makes it much harder for the trolls to do their job. *The views expressed herein are those of the author, based on research conducted by the author, and may not necessarily represent the views of others unless otherwise noted.

Rain is pouring hard and fast\u2014more than eight inches in just an hour, turning river water brown with mud. Earthworms wiggle up to the ground as the soil becomes too wet for them. A flood might be coming. Just about any place on Earth can experience flooding. When so much rain falls that the ground can\u2019t absorb it or waterways can\u2019t hold it, the overflowing water becomes a destructive force. In the United States, flooding causes more death and damage than tornadoes, hurricanes, or lightning. During a rainstorm, precipitation\u2014or the water that comes from rain or snow\u2014goes to different places. Some of it flows into streams, lakes, or city water systems. Other precipitation evaporates and returns to the atmosphere. But much of the rainwater is absorbed by soil. It flows through the top layer of the ground, to plant roots below the surface. This helps provides plants with the water and nutrients they need to grow. The excess water moves deeper into the ground through layers of dirt and rocks where until it becomes part of natural underground wells called groundwater. A habitat can naturally absorb a healthy amount of rainfall it needs to thrive. But too much rain can cause lake and river levels to rise and overflow their banks, or the soil to become too wet to absorb more water. And though you might think extremely dry habitats would welcome too much rain, it turns out that the parched dirt can\u2019t absorb the rain fast enough to capture it all. Severe coastal storms, quickly melting ice and snow, and collapsed barriers (like concrete dams) can also cause floods. Even damaged beaver dams can lead to an overflow of water that the surrounding earth can\u2019t absorb. Floods can form slowly over several days or overwhelm an area with little warning. How quickly a flood forms often depends on the habitat. Slow-forming river flooding happens in regions called floodplains. These are large, flat areas of land along waterways with very shallow banks. When big storms hit, the water overflows the banks and spreads out across the plains. This type of flooding isn\u2019t always bad. It brings nutrients to the surrounding soil, making it fertile for growing crops. That\u2019s why many people live in or near floodplains. But too much water can destroy crops and damage homes. Rushing water can disrupt ecosystems by moving aquatic plants and animals to other habitats. And if flooding is so severe that it flows into local water treatment facilities, experts must monitor the incoming water to make sure the water is safe. Another type of flooding is called a flash flood, when a flood happens within six hours of a heavy rainfall\u2014as much as eight inches an hour. With no place to go, the moving water will tear through highways, valleys, and canyons, washing away vehicles, roads, bridges, and houses. Quickly melting ice and snow can also cause flash flooding, especially when mountain snowmelt overflows the waterways below. On coastlines, hurricane rains cause water levels to rise, and the high winds push that water onto land. Called a storm surge, this also causes flash flooding. Scientists believe that warming temperatures caused by climate change are increasing the risk of floods all over the world, especially in coastal and low-lying areas. Warmer water changes the patterns of ocean currents, which changes global weather patterns. This means that some places will receive more rainfall than the ground can absorb. Other places will get less rain so the land will be drier\u2014and unable to handle rainfall when it does occur. Scientists think that climate change could also cause stronger hurricanes, with more rain and higher winds causing bigger storm surges. A warmer climate could also mean more snowmelt overwhelming the soil; melting polar ice could cause sea levels to rise and increase flooding. (Find out how you can help slow climate change.) Experts might issue a flash flood watch if weather conditions are right. It doesn\u2019t mean flooding will happen but that meteorologists want people to be prepared. When experts are sure a flash flood is on the way, they issue a warning so people can evacuate immediately. Here\u2019s how to keep you and your family safe. Before a flood\u2022 Know your neighborhood. Research how close you are to streams, drainage channels, canyons, and any other low-lying areas that might flood.\u2022 Keep emergency contact phone numbers in one place so you can get in touch with family members.\u2022 Put together an evacuation plan and share it with everyone in your household. Know what paths and routes you can use to quickly get to a high, dry place.\u2022 Conduct flood drills to practice evacuating quickly.\u2022 Maintain an emergency kit with a three-day supply of food and water. Experts recommend canned or dried foods that don't need to be cooked, and at least one gallon of water per day for each person and pet. During a flood\u2022 Never wait for orders to leave; if you think a flood might be coming, evacuate immediately.\u2022 If flooding hasn\u2019t started, move important items to upper floors of your house.\u2022 If flooding has already started where you are, move to the highest place you can find, like a roof of a house or car. Bring as much food, water, and sheltering blankets as possible.\u2022 Never walk through flood water, especially if it\u2019s moving. Hazardous chemicals, sewage, and even wild animals are often in floodwater, and just six inches of moving water can knock you off your feet.\u2022 If you must walk through water to escape, walk where the water is still. Never touch electrical equipment if you are standing in water, or even if you\u2019re wet.\u2022 If water is quickly rising while you\u2019re in your car, leave your vehicle and move to higher ground, like a hill or bridge. After a flood\u2022 If you\u2019ve evacuated your house, return only after you\u2019re given the all-clear from officials.\u2022 If you stayed put, check ... [Content truncated]",

But a cellphone video filmed during Hurricane Ian's assault on southwest Florida isn't just another fish story. The eye-popping video, which showed a large, dark fish with sharp dorsal fins thrashing around an inundated Fort Myers backyard, racked up more than 12 million views on Twitter within a day, as users responded with disbelief and comparisons to the \"Sharknado\" film series. Dominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer, confirmed he filmed the clip from his back patio Wednesday morning when he saw something \"flopping around\" in his neighbor's flooded yard. \"I didn't know what it was -- it just looked like a fish or something,\" he told The Associated Press. \"I zoomed in, and all my friends are like, 'It's like a shark, man!'\" He guessed the fish was about four feet (1.2 metres) in length. Experts were of mixed opinion on whether the clip showed a shark or another large fish. George Burgess, former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History's shark program, said in an email that it \"appears to be a juvenile shark,\" while Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, director of the University of Miami's shark conservation program, wrote that \"it's pretty hard to tell.\" Nevertheless, some Twitter users dubbed the hapless fish the \"street shark.\" The surge worsened in Fort Myers as the day went on. Cameratta said the flooding had only just begun when the clip was taken, but that the waters were \"all the way up to our house\" by the time the AP reached him by phone Wednesday evening. He said the fish may have made its way up from nearby Hendry Creek into a retention pond, which then overflowed, spilling the creature into his neighbor's backyard. A visual analysis of nearby property confirmed it matches the physical landmarks in the video. Leslie Guelcher, a professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, was among the online sleuths who initially thought the video was fake. \"Don't think this is real. According to the index on the video it was created in June 2010. Someone else posted it at 10 AM as in Fort Myers, but the storm surge wasn't like that at 10 AM,\" she tweeted Wednesday. Guelcher acknowledged later, though, that online tools she and others were using to establish the video's origins didn't actually show when the video itself was created, merely when the social media profile of the user was created. The AP confirmed through the original clip's metadata that it was captured Wednesday morning. \"It makes a bit more sense from a flooding standpoint,\" she said by email, when informed the fish was spotted near an overflowing pond. \"But how on earth would a shark go from the Gulf of Mexico to a retention pond?\" Yannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, said that most sharks flee shallow bays ahead of hurricanes, possibly tipped off to their arrival by a change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he said, or been washed into it. \"Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters -- rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments -- and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,\" Burgess said. \"Assuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.\" Cameratta sent the video to a group chat on WhatsApp on Wednesday morning, according to his friend John Paul Murray, who sent the AP a timestamped screenshot. \"Amazing content,\" Murray wrote in reply. ------ Associated Press writers Philip Marcelo and Arijeta Lajka in New York contributed to this report. The shooting at former U.S. president Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Pennsylvania is being investigated as an attempted assassination of the former president and presumptive Republican nominee, law enforcement officials say. Canada's prime minister and other leaders condemned political violence following a shooting at a Republican rally Saturday, during what appears to have been an assassination attempt targeting Donald Trump.
