A line of cars, stuffed with bedding, some with strapped on generators, some pulling rowing boats, all headed back in, to see what was left.\nAs we got closer, the desperation grew greater.\nIn Fort Myers, zigzags of cars wound down palm tree-strewn streets, in line for a gas station with no gas. People were stood waiting with jerrycans, some since the early hours of the morning.\nThere is destruction here: upended concrete pillars, boats piled up on the shore, but the Stars and Stripes still fly - albeit the flags are ripped in half.\nIt is the logistical challenge that is most striking.

                "content": "Hurricane Ian pummeled Florida’s Southwestern coast Wednesday afternoon before moving toward Orlando in the evening, leaving more than 2.5 million people across Florida without power Thursday and widespread flooding in the areas that were in the category 4 storm’s destructive path. Search and rescues are still underway as dozens of homes remain underwater in Fort Myers, near where the storm, with 150 mph winds, made landfall in Cayo Costa Wednesday. On Thursday, President Biden said Ian could be the “deadliest hurricane in Florida’s history,” during a FEMA briefing. While the death toll from the storm is unclear, Biden said there could be a “substantial loss of life.” Although the storm was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm Thursday morning, experts say Ian, which currently has sustained winds of 65 mph and was located 25 miles from north north-east of Cape Canaveral at 11 a.m., could regain strength as it travels across Florida and up the Atlantic coast—threatening Georgia and South Carolina. “Some slight re-intensification is forecast, and Ian could be near hurricane strength when it approaches the coast of South Carolina on Friday,” the National Hurricane Center said Thursday. Ian brought torrential rain, storm surges up to 18 feet, flooding that swept away cars, toppled infrastructure, trapped people in their homes and devastated communities across Florida. Officials says it could be days before they’re able to asses the scale of the damage Ian caused. “You’re looking at a storm that’s changed the character of a significant part of our state,” Fla. Gov. Ron DeSantis said on Thursday morning from an Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee. “This is going to require, not just the emergency response now, and the days or weeks ahead, I mean this is going to require years of effort, to be able to rebuild, to come back.” Read More: Yes, Climate Change Is Making Storms Like Hurricane Ian Worse Desantis added that there were two unconfirmed fatalities in Florida from the storm so far. Emergency officials urge people to seek higher ground and shelter in place until the threat clears completely. President Biden declared a disaster in Florida Thursday morning, a move that makes millions in emergency recovery aid available, particularly for the counties affected the most, and DeSantis said the state will push for more federal help. In addition to the “thousands of Floridians who need help rebuilding” their homes and businesses, DeSantis said, the storm destroyed hospitals, power lines, roads and bridges that connected islands to the mainland. . Here’s what you need to know. Although much of the state lost power and underwent evacuation orders, Southwest Florida, the region where the hurricane made landfall, has been the hardest hit. Coastal storm surges were highest in this area and subsequent flooding and heavy rainfall made the situation worse. On Thursday morning, Ian was still dumping large amounts of rain in the area, and flooding is still a large concern. On Thursday, emergency responders attempted to work through a backlog of 911 calls in areas where the storm had been impassable like in Cape Coral and Fort Myers where emergency responders had to prioritize “urgent, life threatening situations” first. The Florida Department of Transportation was deployed to clear roads of debris to help disaster responders get around, but DeSantis has asked everyone else to stay off the roads for their own safety. Gov. DeSantis added during Thursday’s press conference that Ian “is not done creating damage,” and told residents that it’s still a hazardous situation. Search and rescue efforts are underway in hard hit Lee County where the Sanibel Causeway and Matlacha islands suffered extensive damage. Power is out for 98% of the county as well as much of the water system and parts of the county are under a boil water notice. Lee’s more than 400 traffic signals are also not fully operational and drainage infrastructure in low-lying areas has failed leaving many roads flooded. Nearby Charlotte County is home to Punta Cana where the water system is currently empty and damaged pipes may take days to repair. The City of Naples in Collier County has asked people not to drive in or to Naples and is under a local state of emergency. DeSoto County, Hendry County and Glades County also all opened temporary shelters. Power outages and spotty cellular service hit Southwest Florida and in some places, services like sanitation, trash collection and postal service are non functioning for the foreseeable future. More airports have halted operations, including Jacksonville International. Most municipalities in Southwest Florida are asking residents to shelter in place while emergency and public service groups rush to repair essential infrastructure. Floridians had been preparing for Ian since Monday, especially around the Tampa Bay region where flights were pre-emptively canceled, power was cut in downtown Tampa by the city to mitigate equipment damage from the storm and more than 2.5 million people were given evacuation orders. The death toll related to Ian is unclear, but Alongside Biden saying there could be a “substantial loss of life,” Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno told Good Morning America on Thursday that he didn’t have a confirmed number of fatalities from the storm, but that he definitely knows “the fatalities are in the hundreds.” Gov. DeSantis later clarified during a press conference Thursday that Marceno’s statement was an estimate based on the emergency calls that law enforcement received. The governor said that they have not confirmed “hundreds of fatalities.” Marceno also said Lee County had received thousands of 911 calls over the course of the storm, but that emergency responders “still cannot access many of the people that are in need.” Similar statements from law enforcement agencies in nearby areas also confirmed that first responders are having a great deal of difficulty accessing flooded neighborhoods and collapsed buildings. The U.S. Department of Labor put out a statement on Thursday reminding those involved in Hurricane Ian recovery efforts to stay vigilant of hazards that flooding, power loss and storm debris can cause. Such hazards have ... [Content truncated]",

                "content": "Hurricane Ian destroyed several portions of the Sanibel Causeway, the series of bridges that connects mainland Florida to Sanibel Island — which is home to some 6,500 people and located just south of where the storm made landfall.\r\n\nOfficials have characterized the extent of the damage as beyond simple repairs.\r\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis confirmed at a Thursday morning briefing that the Sanibel Causeway is one of at least two bridges (along with the bridge that connects to Pine Island) that are \"impassable\" and will \"require structural rebuilds.\"\r\n\nHe said on Friday that the three-mile causeway \"had breaks in multiple parts of it.\"\r\n\n\"It was not where the water and the pylons were, those held up very well,\" he said at a Friday morning briefing. \"It was where you had some on the sandbar, and that got washed out from underneath.\"\r\n\nLee County had ordered people on the island to evacuate before the storm hit, though not everyone did. Sanibel Mayor Holly Smith said Thursday that the occupants of about 200 homes had stayed behind, and that authorities had already confirmed two injuries and 12 deaths on Sanibel.\r\n\nIt appears that other residents are effectively stranded on the island, either because they declined evacuation offers by rescue crews or because they are unaccounted for.\r\n\nDeSantis said that same day that an unspecified number of people had been safely brought off the island and that rescue efforts by the U.S. Coast Guard, local law enforcement and state teams were ongoing. The Coast Guard has shared photos of crews airlifting people from flooded parts of the island.\r\n\nOfficials are running barges in order to ferry supplies and heavier equipment to the island (whereas emergency responders had initially been traveling lighter and via air), DeSantis said on Friday.\r\n\nSmith had requested barge service for short-term recovery, as well as \"possibly for the long-term for island access due to the condition of the causeway.\"\r\n\nSmith is urging residents to provide authorities with the names and addresses of any loved ones who may have remained on the island, saying \"our first priority is to get those who are stranded to safety\" and account for missing people.\r\n\nNo electric customers on Sanibel Island had power as of an 11 a.m. ET Friday morning update from the Lee County Electric Cooperative.\r\n\n\n\nAt least three sections of the causeway were washed away by the storm surge, CNN affiliates WBBH and WPLG report, cutting the Sanibel and Captiva islands off from the rest of the state.\r\n\nDamage to the causeway was first reported in the early hours of Thursday morning by local journalists, who shared photos of the bridge with pieces missing.\r\n\nAmong them were Tampa Bay Times reporter Zachary Sampson and photojournalist Douglas Clifford, who ventured out of their Fort Myers hotel room in the early hours of Thursday morning to check on the damage and publish eyewitness accounts on the Times' website.\r\n\nIn a dispatch at 2 a.m. ET, they reported that the half-mile of road leading to the Sanibel Causeway was impassable.\r\n\n\"The pavement is folded up like an accordion, ripped to ribbons by a powerful storm surge,\" they wrote. \"Nearby, a spiral staircase was deposited in the brush next to a white pickup. The storm flung a boat trailer and other debris, too.\"\r\n\nThey describe seeing sheets of sand strewn across the pavement and watching around 1:30 a.m. as two cars tried unsuccessfully to access the island. One was full of young men who were trying to reach a friend, they added.\r\n\nAt 4:15 a.m., the journalists confirmed that a section of the causeway had been wiped out by the storm:\r\n\n\"An alarm bleats endlessly at the tollbooth for the Sanibel Causeway. Step just beyond it, and the road soon gives way. Where the bridge rises from the mainland toward the island, one of the first sections of the span has disappeared. Crumbled pavement lies near the water's edge. The rest of the bridge stretches forward, unreachable.\" \r\n\n Copyright 2022 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. \n\n",

                "content": "Hurricane Shark and Street Shark are nicknames for several claimed instances of a live shark swimming in a flooded urban area, typically in the aftermath of a hurricane. For more than a decade (starting with Hurricane Irene in 2011), all media purporting to document such claims—most notably an image of a shark swimming on a flooded freeway—were debunked as fabrications. However, during Hurricane Ian in 2022, the Associated Press verified a video taken by Dominic Cameratta of a shark or other large fish swimming in flooded Fort Myers, Florida; one consulted expert concluded that the fish was \"a juvenile shark\" while another was unable to determine whether it was a shark.[1] Both the re-emergence of the hoax in hurricane after hurricane and the eventual appearance of a plausible claim have been the subject of commentary and amusement; Daniel Victor of The New York Times described the Associated Press's findings as \"like discovering Bigfoot is real\".[2] The original \"Hurricane Shark\" image was created during Hurricane Irene in 2011, with a claim that the shark was on a street in Puerto Rico.[2] According to The Washington Post, it likely originated on Reddit.[3] In the aftermath of the hurricane, the image was aired by Miami Fox affiliate WSVN,[3] was posted by the Miami Herald, and was widely shared on social media websites including Twitter.[4] The image was debunked by the Post,[3] Snopes.com,[5] and the Toronto Star.[4] It had been created by combining an image of a flooded street in Puerto Rico with a photo of a shark taken by Thomas P. Peschak off of South Africa in 2003.[4] The Post compared it to similar hoax images, such as one supposedly of Osama bin Laden's body following his death.[3] Craig Silverman, writing in the Star, cast it as part of a larger phenomenon of hoax images appearing in the aftermath of significant events.[4] The image has frequently resurfaced on the internet with claims that it was taken during various flooding events,[2] including in Houston during both the 2015 Texas–Oklahoma flood and tornado outbreak and the 2017 floods caused by Hurricane Harvey, and in Daytona Beach, Florida, in 2016 during floods caused by Hurricane Matthew.[5] Peschak has said his fans notify him each time the image re-emerges, but that \"they're more outraged than I am\".[6] After Toronto's Union Station flooded in June 2012, a manipulated image circulated purporting to show two sharks at the base of an escalator bank. The image was later reused in a hoax claiming that a shark tank had burst at the Kuwait Scientific Center.[7][8] While the flooding in Toronto was not the result of a hurricane, the hoax has often been compared to the main Hurricane Shark hoax.[2][9] Later in 2012, after Hurricane Sandy struck New Jersey, other fake shark images circulated in addition to the better-known freeway one. One image appears to depict a shark outside of a home in a suburban area.[10][11] Another appears to show a shark swimming down a suburban street.[12][13] Tom Phillips and Alexis Madrigal found the real shark image used to create the former; Snopes did the same for the latter.[10][13][11] During both Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Florence, fake television breaking news screen captures were seen online saying that the hurricane \"now contains sharks\", although neither contained images of sharks.[14] No, Hurricane Florence does not contain sharks September 13, 2018[15] Hurricane sharks as hoaxes have taken on a life of their own, in social media and in the press. Doctored photos of sharks swimming in urban areas went viral on social media in virtually every disastrous storm and hurricane in the decade since, often copies of the image that first circulated during Irene.[15] Some on social media have treated the Hurricane Shark as a meme, an in-joke hoax to be revived with each disaster, while others have genuinely believed in the authenticity of the photos being spread.[2] Commentators have made comparisons to Sharknado, a film series that also involves sharks caught up in natural disasters.[16][1] In response to the \"now contains sharks\" images circulated during Hurricane Florence, FEMA's Associate Director of Office of Response and Recovery, Jeffrey Byard, denied that \"there's a sharknado effect or anything like that\".[14] Because of the recurring nature of the meme, fact-checkers and journalists in the media have repeatedly needed to clarify that the images of Hurricane sharks were hoaxes. According to Daniel Victor, writing for The New York Times in 2022, Hurricane Shark is the \"longtime nemesis\" of fact-checkers on social media.[2] In Silverman's Verification Handbook, Phillips makes a case study of his work with Madrigal during Hurricane Sandy, describing the images they reviewed as \"strange enough to make you suspicious, yet [not] implausible enough to dismiss out of hand\".[10][13] Rose Eveleth, in a 2014 piece for BBC Future about how to spot fake Sandy photos, includes as her list's final item, \"If it has a shark in it, it's probably fake\".[9] An early claim of sharks in a flooded urban area, predating the original Hurricane Shark hoax, occurred in Goodna, Queensland, Australia, amidst major flooding in January 2011.[4] Butcher Steve Bateman reported a shark, roughly 6 feet (1.8 m) in length, swimming past his shop, and several others reported seeing a shark on a different street.[17] Two local politicians vouched for Bateman's credibility, and The Queensland Times noted that sharks are known to swim up the Bremer River to Goodna.[18] In September 2022, after Hurricane Ian struck Florida, a video emerged online of a shark in a flooded backyard in Fort Myers, Florida, drawing over 12 million views within a day.[1] Initially, the video received skepticism from journalists and fact-checkers, wary of the long history of similar media being hoaxes while also noting that the video seemed more authentic than previous renditions.[2] On September 29, the Associated Press, while noting the history of the Hurricane Shark, confirmed the authenticity of the video based on analysis of the video's metadata and an interview with the videographer, Dominic Cameratta. The Associated Press consulted shark experts George H. Burgess and ... [Content truncated]",

                "content": "Photos and videos of sharks and other marine life swimming in suburban floodwaters make for popular hoaxes during massive storms. But a cellphone video filmed during Hurricane Ian's assault on southwest Florida isn't just another fish story. The eye-popping video, which showed a large, dark fish with sharp dorsal fins thrashing around an inundated Fort Myers backyard, racked up more than 12 million views on Twitter within a day, as users responded with disbelief and comparisons to the \"Sharknado\" film series. Dominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer, confirmed he filmed the clip from his back patio Wednesday morning when he saw something \"flopping around\" in his neighbor's flooded yard. \"I didn't know what it was -- it just looked like a fish or something,\" he told The Associated Press. \"I zoomed in, and all my friends are like, 'It's like a shark, man!'\" He guessed the fish was about four feet (1.2 metres) in length. Experts were of mixed opinion on whether the clip showed a shark or another large fish. George Burgess, former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History's shark program, said in an email that it \"appears to be a juvenile shark,\" while Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, director of the University of Miami's shark conservation program, wrote that \"it's pretty hard to tell.\" Nevertheless, some Twitter users dubbed the hapless fish the \"street shark.\" The surge worsened in Fort Myers as the day went on. Cameratta said the flooding had only just begun when the clip was taken, but that the waters were \"all the way up to our house\" by the time the AP reached him by phone Wednesday evening. He said the fish may have made its way up from nearby Hendry Creek into a retention pond, which then overflowed, spilling the creature into his neighbor's backyard. A visual analysis of nearby property confirmed it matches the physical landmarks in the video. Leslie Guelcher, a professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, was among the online sleuths who initially thought the video was fake. \"Don't think this is real. According to the index on the video it was created in June 2010. Someone else posted it at 10 AM as in Fort Myers, but the storm surge wasn't like that at 10 AM,\" she tweeted Wednesday. Guelcher acknowledged later, though, that online tools she and others were using to establish the video's origins didn't actually show when the video itself was created, merely when the social media profile of the user was created. The AP confirmed through the original clip's metadata that it was captured Wednesday morning. \"It makes a bit more sense from a flooding standpoint,\" she said by email, when informed the fish was spotted near an overflowing pond. \"But how on earth would a shark go from the Gulf of Mexico to a retention pond?\" Yannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, said that most sharks flee shallow bays ahead of hurricanes, possibly tipped off to their arrival by a change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he said, or been washed into it. \"Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters -- rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments -- and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,\" Burgess said. \"Assuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.\" Cameratta sent the video to a group chat on WhatsApp on Wednesday morning, according to his friend John Paul Murray, who sent the AP a timestamped screenshot. \"Amazing content,\" Murray wrote in reply. ------ Associated Press writers Philip Marcelo and Arijeta Lajka in New York contributed to this report.

A judge dismissed all sexual misconduct charges against a Newfoundland lawyer Thursday, saying repeated inconsistencies and falsehoods in the complainant's accounts eroded her credibility and left him unable to believe her allegations.

                "content": "It's common for hoax photos and videos of sharks swimming in flooded streets to surface during hurricanes and they're often quickly debunked. But a new video of a shark in Hurricane Ian's storm surge has people thinking it is the real deal. Hurricane Ian slammed into Florida on Wednesday as a Category 4 hurricane with winds just a few miles per hour away from bumping the classification up to a Category 5. The hurricane resulted in a massive storm surge, and that surge appeared to have pushed a shark into a flooded street in Fort Myers, Florida. While some Twitter users tried to take credit for the video or said they got the video from a friend, the Associated Press has confirmed the video was authentic after speaking with the person who filmed the shark struggling to swim in his backyard. According to the AP report, Dominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer who said he filmed the video Wednesday morning, filmed the shark from his back patio when he saw it flopping around in his neighbor's backyard. Cameratta said at first, he thought the animal was a large fish but soon realized it was a shark. He estimated the shark to be 4 feet long. Cameratta lives near a retention pond, and he said he assumed the shark made it up Hendry Creek and into the pond. The pond then overflowed from storm surge and heavy rain, transporting the shark into the flooded backyard. Some experts told AP they thought the shark looked to be a juvenile. Twitter user THE Alex shared the video at approximately 10 a.m. on Wednesday. The video shows what appears to be a shark flopping around in an apparently flooded street. The animal in the video is seen thrashing its tail back and forth as winds gust in the background. \"My buddy just sent me a video of this shark swimming down his back yard in Fort Myers,\" THE Alex tweeted Wednesday. My buddy just sent me a video of this this shark swimming down his back yard in Fort Myers 😂#hurricane #Ian #HurricaneIan pic.twitter.com/kLon2z3F8Q Leslie Guelcher, an assistant professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University who goes by Dr. G on Twitter, was one of the people who questioned the video's authenticity. Prior to AP's verification, Guelcher tweeted that the video index showed a creation date of June 2010. She later told Newsweek she misread the index data, but she is unconvinced the video is real because the video was taken before the storm surge rose in earnest in Fort Myers. \"I'm still not convinced it is accurate although the person who commented provided the name of who filmed it and where,\" Guelcher said. \"However, a reverse image search on Google, limiting to site:Twitter.com shows a number of posts with at least one being from before the storm surge hit.\" She later said she could see how a shark could go from the Gulf of Mexico into a retention pond. However, some experts expect the shark may have sensed a drop in barometric pressure signifying the approaching hurricane. It may have attempted to flee shallow waters to somewhere safer. However, the shark could have accidentally entered the creek and then the pond in its attempts to flee, or flooding could have forced the animal into the residential area. The video's confirmation was the culmination of five years of searching for Jane Lytvynenko, a freelance reporter who has spent years debunking hoaxes. Before the video was confirmed as real, Lytvynenko implied it had credibility. \"I can't believe I'm looking at an honest-to-god street shark,\" Lytvynenko tweeted. \"Good to finally meet you, pal.\" After over half a decade of debunking this hoax every time there was a flood or hurricane, I can't believe I'm looking at an honest-to-god street shark.Good to finally meet you, pal. https://t.co/hwMWX4Peqo Shark hoaxes have emerged in many hurricanes since a fake image of a shark swimming through a flooded highway was first posted in 2012. Social media agency Storyful also verified the video was authentic but couldn't confirm if the footage showed a small shark or a different fish, such as a cobia. Florida officials warned residents that some wildlife might emerge during the storm, namely bears, alligators and snakes, as wildlife becomes more active and disoriented during massive storms. Newsweek reached out to Florida Fish and Wildlife for comment. Update 9/30/2022 11:15 a.m. ET: This story has been updated with additional information.
