Burkina Faso Israel/Palestine Lebanon Sudan Venezuela None South China Sea Democratic Republic of Congo Sudan Kenya Israel/Palestine Burkina Faso None Burkina Faso Our monthly conflict tracker highlights five conflict risks in July. CrisisWatch identified six deteriorations in June. Notably: Aside from the scores of conflict situations we regularly assess, we tracked significant developments in: Bolivia, Cuba, Gabon, Honduras, Madagascar, Moldova, New Caledonia and South Africa. What happened in June? In what could amount to the deadliest attack on the army since anti-jihadist operations began in 2015, the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (JNIM) reportedly killed on 11 June over 100 soldiers in an attack on a military base in Mansila town, Yagha province, Sahel region. The following day, artillery fire hit state television headquarters near the presidential residence in the capital Ouagadougou. Although President Ibrahim Traoré said a soldier had accidentally mishandled a weapon, unconfirmed rumours swirled that the Mansila attack had provoked an army mutiny. Attacks by security forces and jihadists causing mass civilian casualties continued. Why does it matter? The 11 June attack and rumours of growing discontent within the armed forces serve as a stark reminder of Traoré’s inability to halt jihadist violence and stop Burkina Faso’s downward spiral. While the military government publicly insists that it is restoring security, the massacre at Mansila, as with other deadly attacks against the army in the weeks before, illustrates that it has thus far been unable to do so. The attack has exposed and fuelled divisions within the military, leading to speculation of threats to the regime’s grip on power. Caught between jihadists and security forces, civilians are meanwhile paying a heavy price. What to watch in the coming weeks and months? The government’s security failures could threaten its survival. Long-standing divisions within the military are likely to become more prominent, and reports of budget shortages could mean that parts of the security forces are not being paid. President Traoré may increasingly rely on outside support from Africa Corps and Sahelian allies, especially Mali and Niger, to stay in power. Still, if the security situation continues to deteriorate at its current pace, a power struggle could erupt within the military, and lead to Traoré’s ouster. A leadership vacuum could benefit jihadist groups and worsen an already catastrophic humanitarian crisis. As they struggle to get a grip on security, the authorities are likely to continue their heavy-handed crackdown on dissent. They have banned almost all foreign broadcasters and blocked their websites for reporting on human rights groups’ allegations that the security forces are responsible for slaughtering civilians. Some local media have also been banned. Critics of the military regime have been forcibly conscripted or disappeared. Repression will likely increase as the junta tries to bury reports of jihadist attacks on soldiers like the Mansila massacre. The recent extension of a general mobilisation decree means the government will continue to rely on forced conscription to suppress any critical voices. Meantime, villagers across the country – especially in the Est, Centre-Est, Sahel, Centre-Nord, Nord, Boucle du Mouhoun regions – find themselves trapped between jihadist groups and security forces, both of which often use indiscriminate violence. Widespread displacement – with at least two million currently on the move – is unlikely to end soon as civilians fear returning to areas recently recaptured by the government for fear of persistent insecurity and as jihadists maintain a blockade on dozens of towns. What should be done? Recognising that it will need popular support to defeat the jihadists, the government should place a much higher emphasis on protecting communities and curbing abuse within its ranks. Western partners should continue to engage with the military regime in Ouagadougou in non-security sectors, particularly promoting social cohesion and community dialogue as part of an effort to convince the authorities of the utility of non-military solutions to insecurity. To ensure that massacres of civilians are not forgotten or silenced by state-controlled media, Western partners should also make public statements whenever large-scale massacres are committed by one of the parties to the conflict. Western partners should also continue to help humanitarian actors and relevant ministries provide humanitarian assistance to populations in need, notably internally displaced people, that are an estimated 10 per cent of a total population of 22 million. Detention of Nigerien nationals ratcheted up bilateral tensions; threat of jihadist spillover from neighbouring countries remained high. Diplomatic standoff with Niger continued with arrest of Nigerien oil workers. Bilateral tensions persisted as Niger refused to reopen its land border and oil exports through shared pipeline faced blockages from both govts. Authorities 5 June arrested five Nigeriens working for Chinese-Nigerien operator of pipeline (WAPCo), alleging they fraudulently attempted to access oil terminal and accusing them of spying; in response, Niamey next day blocked oil exports from their side and 8 June denounced “kidnapping” of workers (see Niger). Govt 13 June released two of those detained but 17 June convicted other three, including WAPCo deputy director general, of falsifying data, giving them 18-month suspended sentence; relatively lenient sentence seen by many as attempt at compromise while former presidents Bony Yayi and Soglo 25 June travelled to Niger and met Nigerien President Gen. Tiani and PM Zeine in attempt to ease tensions; oil exports, however, remained on hold. Jihadist violence continued in north. Pendjari National Park and others including W Park remained vulnerable to jihadist infiltration from Burkina Faso and Niger despite ongoing deployment of troops in area. Notably, gunmen 4 June killed seven soldiers in ambush near Tanguieta town in Pendjari park in ... [Content truncated]",

[+] which is allowed to visit by the city authorities on August 13, 2023 in Odesa, Ukraine. In Odesa six beaches were officially opened for swimming - for the first time since the start of a full-scale war. (смысловой повтор текста). However, people also continue to swim on the other beaches of the city, where swimming is prohibited. (Photo by Viacheslav Onyshchenko/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images) A number of videos featuring bikini-clad women made the rounds on Twitter this weekend, but not for the reasons some might expect. The clips purported to show a beach on the Black Sea near the Ukrainian city of Odesa after it reportedly reopened for the first time since Russia's invasion. The post was met with a backlash as those critical of U.S. and other Western aid being provided to Ukraine voiced their frustration that it didn't resemble a warzone. However, other users on Twitter soon weighed in that the video was actually filmed at the Strandbad Plötzensee, a lake in the city of Berlin, Germany! Another video also circulated showing a party-like gathering at the Ibiza Beach Club in Odesa. It does resemble the images and videos on the club's official website, and it is—or at least was—a very popular hotspot, yet, it remains unclear when the video may have actually been filmed. The club's Facebook page hasn't been updated since 2018 and no videos have been posted to its YouTube page since July of 2021—more than six months before Russia launched its unprovoked invasion. It would appear that the Ibiza Beach Club in Odesa may still be closed. However, there is a grain of truth to the story. As Reuters reported on Saturday, several beaches in the city have been officially opened for swimming, but bathing in the sea is banned during air raid alerts. It is also important to note the city has been repeatedly attacked with missiles and drones, while the waters have been littered with hundreds of sea mines. In other words, people may be swimming in Ukraine, but it is hardly the party atmosphere some on social media have suggested. \"This is a classic piece of disinformation. There are a few interesting things about this. First, this is what I always think of as a 'cheap fake' instead of a 'DeepFake,'\" said Dr. Cliff Lampe, professor of information and associate dean for academic affairs in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. \"The only thing they did was to add a tag to an already existing video,\" explained Lampe. \"No AI needed, just the simplest of video techniques. We've seen this several times, and these cheap fakes are very prevalent as a type of disinformation.\" Lampe added that whoever first posted the video was also clever in that it uses attractive people to immediately grab attention, but then also layers on sexual moral judgment onto anti-Biden or anti-war intents. \"Disinformation needs to gather attention, which this effectively did, and it is more effective when it hits on multiple levels of outrage,\" said Lampe. \"I wouldn't say this changed any minds. That's usually not the goal behind disinformation—which is more about deepening already held beliefs and calling into question the very nature of truth itself. Clearly, this was a successful effort.\" What was also notable with these videos is that the online sleuths quickly identified that one of the videos was filmed in Germany, while some were wrong that the other wasn't actually Odessa. That could make others question a fact-checker if they turn out to be wrong. It also makes us question whether we can even trust fact-checkers in general! \"It depends on the post and the fact-checkers. I'd believe Bellingcat without question because they disclose their methodology and they have a track record,\" suggested Dr. Matthew Schmidt, associate professor in the National Security Department at the University of New Haven. \"If someone replied to this with convincing photographic evidence, which was then agreed to by the consensus of responses, I'd be inclined to believe it,\" Schmidt continued. \"The point is that there's a great wealth of talent in the open source community, so they've repeatedly shown they're right about things.\" However, it could still be good to be skeptical by default. \"Like a scientist saying 'I believe X with 75% confidence, but Y with 90%.' People need to think in probabilities, then they can use open source intel intelligently,\" Schmidt noted. \"It's not just right or wrong, it's shades of right enoughness.\" On the surface having open source fact-checkers could seem to be a case of \"who guards the guardians\"—Quis custodiet ipsos custodes. However, Schmidt dismissed that notion. \"This isn't so much who guards the guardians—because these guys on the Internet aren't the guardians—but who is guarding the gate to true intelligence,\" Schmidt pondered. \"Is it the guardians at the CIA or the crowd? Because the amount of open source Intel that drives analysis at places like the CIA would surprise people. They're feeding the guardians. And the really TS/SCI (Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information) stuff is the dessert, not the main meal.\" One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.
