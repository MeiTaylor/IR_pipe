When you verify your business, you can check that your info is correct and that you’re the only one who can edit it.\nTo avoid delays, make sure your address meets our guidelines. Learn about address entry guidelines.\nGet verified\n\n\nTo maintain quality business info, Google may ask a verified business to verify again. If you change some info about your business, you may need to re-verify. We might also ask you to update your business info or give more details about your business.\nTo re-verify, go to your verified Business Profile and follow the steps.\nImportant: To get your verification code, make sure that you can answer your business phone number or receive texts. Interactive voice response (IVR) systems will not get the code.\nImportant: Make sure that you can use the email address in the verification screen.\nTo verify your business, you can record a video that shows the details of your business.\nLearn how to verify your business with a video recording.\nTip: If you enter a queue, you can choose to contact our Help Centre. We usually take 24 hours to respond and we may ask you for more info.\nIf verification by mail is available in the product and you choose this method, we send you a verification code. To confirm that your business is at the listed address, you must enter your unique code.\nWhile you wait for your code:\nIf you edit your info or request a new code, we cancel the code in the post and send a new one. This action protects the integrity of your profile.\nEach verification code is unique to your business and the location that you provide. If you update your business address, only the code requested for your current address works. Verification codes expire after 30 days.\nMost codes arrive within 14 days.\nImportant:\nAfter you get your code:\nIf you share management of your profile with a trusted third party, you can add them after you personally enter your code.\nRarely, we can immediately confirm that a specific Google Account owns a specific Business Profile. \nFor example:\nVerification methods are automatically determined and can’t be changed. If you choose to contact our support team, we’ll try to verify your business based on the information provided. We may suggest a live video call to confirm your place of work, tools and proof of management.",

After enrollment, your program administator(s) can register general users and additional program administrators.\n\n\nPlease review the information you've provided because errors can cause delays in approving your enrollment.  If you need to change any information, you can do so before you certify and submit your enrollment.\n\n\nReview your company's obligations as explained in the MOU and indicate whether you agree with the terms.  You will be given the opportunity to download a copy of your electronically signed MOU at the end of the enrollment process. \n\n\nThe enrollment confirmation page confirms that we have received your enrollment information.  Before you go, be sure to print a copy of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) you electronically signed.  We recommend you share it with you human resources manager, legal counsel and other appropriate staff.\nLearn about how E-Verify works, how to enroll, program highlights, and a demonstration of the program.

                    "content": "Post-9/11 GI Bill® students who receive Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA) and/or kicker payments are required to verify their enrollment to continue receiving their payments. Read below to learn more about the enrollment verification requirement and verification methods.\nEnrollment verification is a requirement for Post-9/11 GI Bill students to verify that they have remained enrolled in the same courses or training each month. Students who receive MHA/kicker payments will have their payments withheld if they fail to verify or report that they are no longer enrolled in their courses or training. To streamline the process, VA is providing the options to verify enrollment easily and securely via text message, email, and online at VA.gov. \nThis requirement is only for Post-9/11 GI Bill and does not impact other benefit programs, such as the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB), Veteran Employment Through Technology Education Courses (VET TEC), Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance (DEA), Veterans Rapid Retraining Assistance Program (VRRAP), or the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship.  This requirement also does not currently apply to GI Bill students attending half-time or less or those in on-the-job, apprenticeship, flight, or correspondence training.\nIf you are an MGIB student or participate in the STEM or VET TEC programs, this new requirement does not represent a change for you, as you are already required to verify enrollment.\nStudents will need to verify at the end of each month once their courses or training starts.For example, if your term starts in August, you will need to begin verifying at the end of August.\nYou can verify enrollment via text, email, or online at VA.gov.  See more details below:If you need to verify your enrollment and are looking for instructions on how to do it, check out the How to Verify Enrollment for Post-9/11 GI Bill Students video.\nBy Text Message:\nNOTE: When responding to opt-in or verification texts, it may take up to a day to receive a confirmation text in response.  Be assured that your response has been received. Texts will be sent from 44354.\nEnrollment verification via text message is safe and secure. VA will never ask for your personal information, such as social security number or bank account information, via text.  VA strongly recommends text message verifications for verifying your renrollment.\nBy Email:\nOnline at VA.gov\nNOTE: If you are opted into text or email verification and verify on VA.gov prior to receiving the verification text or email at the end of the month, you will still receive a notfication on the last day of the month.\nBy Phone\nPhone verification is the least recommended option, but if you are unable to verify via text, email, or online, you will need to contact the Education Call Center (ECC) at 1-888-GIBILL-1 (1-888-442-4551) domestically or 001-918-781-5678 internationally and ask a representative to verify your enrollment.\nNOTE: ECC wait times may be high due to the number of students verifying enrollment each month.\nIf you fail to verify enrollment for two consecutive months, your MHA/kicker payments will be placed on hold. To have your payments released, you will need to use online verification, Ask VA or call the ECC to verify your enrollment.\nBy regularly verifying your enrollment, you protect your GI Bill entitlement by preventing charges for classes or training you did not attend. Though this requirement is an additional step, enrollment verification is easy to do and will help you better manage and access your earned benefits, as well as help prevent overpayments.\nTo learn more about how VA is protecting your information, visit our text message terms and conditions.\nTo learn more, please visit the following resources:   ●  Frequently Asked Questions   ●  Video: How to Verify Enrollment for Post-9/11 GI Bill® Students  \nVeterans Crisis Line:\n988 (Press 1)\nSocial Media\nComplete Directory \nIf you are in crisis or having thoughts of suicide,\r\n\tvisit VeteransCrisisLine.net for more resources.\nU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs | 810 Vermont Avenue, NW Washington DC 20420\nLast updated January 17, 2024",

Testing through the DNR is free for deer harvested in Wisconsin.\nOn this page, you will find:\nFor information on CWD test results, visit the test results page.\nNOTE: The map below shows locations currently on the landscape. Please check this page frequently for updates as locations change throughout the season.\nFull page view of the CWD sample and disposal locations. A searchable database of locations is also available.\nThe DNR offers hunters four ways to submit a sample from their harvested deer for CWD testing. Choose the method that’s most convenient for you.\nWe add locations throughout the season, with many added ahead of the nine-day gun deer season. Hunters can drop off their deer’s head with 5 inches of neck attached for testing. Check the DNR’s CWD sampling page before your hunt to find a location near you.\nYou can get assistance with CWD testing by visiting a cooperating partner.\nHunters can extract the retropharyngeal lymph nodes themselves for CWD testing:\nHunters can arrange an appointment by contacting the DNR Wildlife Switchboard by emailing DNRWildlifeSwitchboard@wisconsin.gov or calling 608-267-0866. You will need to leave a message for the switchboard staff who will forward your message to the local biologist.\nIn your message, please include:\nTake your deer to a sampling station as soon as possible after harvest. If you choose not to bring the full carcass, remove the deer's head with 5 inches of neck attached. Heads can be brought to a sampling location up to five days after harvest if kept refrigerated (35°F to 45°F) or longer if frozen.\nIf you harvested a buck and would like to keep only the antlers, you may skull cap the deer after registration and prior to bringing it to a sampling station. If you are using a self-service kiosk, you will be advised to remove the antlers before placing the head in the dropbox.\nSee the Frequently Asked Questions section below for information on shoulder-mounted and European-mounted deer.\nWhichever method you choose to submit your sample, follow these steps to complete the process:\nA deer that will be shoulder-mounted can still be tested for CWD. The deer should be registered and then taken to your taxidermist for caping and skull cap. The caped head can then be brought to a sampling station. Please remember to follow all sample preservation guidelines.\nA European mount can be brought to a staffed sampling station that will remove the lymph nodes for sampling, allowing the skull to stay with the hunter. Call ahead to ensure the station will be staffed at the time you plan to arrive.\nOnce a hunter submits a sample, test results are added as they become available. During an average year, results are available 10-14 days after the deer is brought to a sampling station.\nYes. The DNR does not intend to prevent hunters from moving a deer head and hand-width length of neck outside a CWD-affected county if it is being transported to an approved CWD sampling cooperator, self-service kiosk or staffed CWD testing location to submit the head for tissue removal and testing. Heads will be disposed of properly after tissue removal.\nYes. Testing is also available for a fee through private veterinarians EXIT DNR [PDF] or the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory [exit DNR] for sampling.\n\n© Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources | Site requirements | Accessibility | Legal | Privacy | Employee resources",
