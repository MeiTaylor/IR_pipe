                "content": "Available with Image Analyst license. Creates a video file that combines an archived video stream file and an associated metadata file synchronized by a time stamp. The tool creates a single FMV-compliant video file from a video stream file and a separate associated metadata file. The metadata is encoded in the video file by a synchronized time stamp. The process of combining the two files containing the video and metadata files is called multiplexing. This tool is designed for archived video files and does not work with live video streams. The format of the video file to be multiplexed must be one of the supported video formats. The separate metadata file is a comma-separated values (CSV) file containing the proper field headings and associated values. The video formats supported as an input to the tool are listed in the following table: DescriptionExtensionMOV file.movMPEG-2 Transport Stream.tsMPEG-2 Program Stream.psMPEG File.mpgMPEG-2 File.mpg2MPEG-2 File.mp2MPEG File.mpegVLC (mpeg2).mpeg2MPEG-4 Movie.mp4MPEG-4 File.mpg4MPEG-Dash.mpdH264 Video File¹.h264H265 Video File¹.h265VLC Media File (mpeg4).mpeg4VLC Media File (vob).vobHLS (Adaptive Bitrate (ABR)).m3u8¹ Requires multiplexing MOV file MPEG-2 Transport Stream MPEG-2 Program Stream MPEG File MPEG-2 File MPEG-2 File MPEG File VLC (mpeg2) MPEG-4 Movie MPEG-4 File MPEG-Dash H264 Video File¹ H265 Video File¹ VLC Media File (mpeg4) VLC Media File (vob) HLS (Adaptive Bitrate (ABR)) ¹ Requires multiplexing The video file output format from the tool is .ts only. The metadata associated with the video stream file is used to compute the flight path of the video sensor, the video image frame center, and the four corners of the video frame footprint on the map. FMV supports the Motion Imagery Standards Board (MISB) specification. The full MISB specification defines many more parameters than those required for FMV. The MISB parameters provided will be encoded into the final video, including all parameters or a subset thereof. To compute and display the relative corner points of the video image footprint as a frame outline on the map, you need the 12 essential metadata fields listed below and further detailed in the parameter description. When the metadata is complete and accurate, the tool will calculate the video frame corners, and the size, shape, and position of the video frame outline that can then be displayed on a map. This is the minimum metadata required to compute the transform between video and map, display the video footprint on the map, and enable other functionality such as digitizing and marking on the video and the map. The values for the metadata fields can be input in the metadata template, FMV_Multiplexer_Field_Mapping_Template.csv, from C:\\Program Files\\ArcGIS\\Pro\\Resources\\FullMotionVideo. The FMV_Multiplexer_Field_Mapping_Template.csv file contains all the MISB metadata fields.Only the 12 parameters defined above are needed to create the FMV-compliant video file. You do not need to provide all the parameters defined in the MISB specification to create an FMV-compliant video file. If additional MISB parameters are provided, they will be encoded into the FMV-compliant video file. The performance of the resulting multiplexed video file depends on the type and quality of the data contained in the metadata file, and how accurately the video data and metadata files are synchronized. One set of parameters in the FMV_Multiplexer_Field_Mapping_Template.csv file includes the map coordinates of the four corners of the video image frame projected to the ground. If the four corner map coordinates are provided, they will be used in creating the FMV-compliant video. If the four corner map coordinates are not provided, provide a source for DEM data in the Digital Elevation Model parameter, and the tool will compute the video footprint from the required parameters listed above. The accuracy of the video footprint and frame center depends on the accuracy of the DEM data source provided. If you do not have access to DEM data, you can enter an average elevation and unit relative to sea level, such as 15 feet or 10 meters. In the case of a submersible, you can enter -15 feet or -10 meters. Using an average elevation or ocean depth is not as accurate as providing a DEM or bathymetric data. It is recommended that you provide a DEM layer or image service if it is available. FMV supports Video Moving Target Indicator (VMTI) data, based on object tracking methods in motion imagery. If VMTI data is recorded in a file separate from the associated video file, it can be encoded into the video file using the video multiplexer tool. FMV supports the MISB Video Moving Target Indicator and Track Metadata standard. Encode the VMTI data into the video by supplying the required VMTI information for the proper video frame using a .csv metadata file containing the data for the fields: LDSVer,TimeStamp,FrameCenterLongitude,FrameCenterLatitude,SensorLongitude,SensorLatitude,vmtilocaldataset5,1546300800231000,-76.1309338,36.91118708,-76.1309338,36.91118708,1 0.9938099 1611919 1815608 1711844;1 0.39056745 1438997 1556213 1496645 The last column, vmtilocaldataset, contains the detected object's bounding box, where each space-delimited value is defined by three values: Object_ID Confidence_Level Top_Left_Pixel Bottom_Right_Pixel Center_Pixel. You can specify multiple object detections for a given time stamp with a ; (semicolon) delimiter as shown in the example above. Use MISB Tag 74 in the FMV_Multiplexer_Field_Mapping_Template.csv file. LabelExplanationData TypeInput Video FileThe input video file that will be converted to a FMV-compliant video file.The following video file types are supported: .avi, .h264, .h265, .mp2, .mp4, .m2ts, .mpeg, .mpeg2, .mpeg4, .mpg, .mpg2, .mpg4, .ps, .ts, and vob.FileMetadata FileA comma-separated values (CSV) file containing metadata about the video frames for specific times. Each column represents one metadata field, and one of the columns must be a time reference. The time reference is Unix Time Stamp (seconds past 1970) multiplied by one million, which is stored as an integer. The time is stored as such so that any instant in time (down to one millionth of a second) can be referenced with an integer. Consequently, a time difference between two entries of 500,000 represents one half of a second in elapsed time. The first row contains the field names for the metadata columns. These field names are listed in the FMV_Multiplexer_Field_Mapping_Template.csv file in C:\\Program Files\\ArcGIS\\Pro\\Resources\\FullMotionVideo, or custom field names can be matched to their corresponding FMV field names using ...

                "content": "ArcGIS Blog We all know how important imagery can be for spatial analysis, and a video is a simply a series of images (frames) captured at a specific rate, such as 30 frames per second. While video data contains important visual information, the application of this information in a GIS is limited unless you know when and where the video was collected. High-performance, sophisticated systems provide video data that comes with this “when and where” metadata already embedded in the video, but lower-cost sensor systems with a GPS and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) are often deployed without embedded metadata. In order to use video data with Full Motion Video capabilities in ArcGIS, the video stream and metadata must be combined into a single compliant video file (compliant with a standard known as MISB). This can be done using the Video Multiplexer geoprocessing tool, available with the Image Analyst extension. You can play a video in the Full Motion Video (FMV) player without any metadata. However, if your video has the proper metadata, you can display the video footprint, sensor location and track, and look angle on your map as you play the video. You can also add features directly in your video and see them displayed on your map, or vice versa. The Video Multiplexer tool embeds geospatial information from a metadata file into a video to produce a geo-enabled video file, which can be visualized and used for data capture in the FMV player. You can get oriented with Video Multiplexer tool with the video multiplexer tutorial. Tutorials can be great teaching mechanisms, but in order to learn all about a workflow we sometimes need a little more than a perfect sample dataset that works like a charm. In this blog, we’ll go over some tips and tricks for working with the Video Multiplexer tool to make sure you can be successful with your own data. Below you will see the minimum metadata requirements to use with the Video Multiplexer tool. With this metadata, the Video Multiplexer can calculate the video frame corners, and thus the size, shape, and position of the video frame outline that can be displayed on a map. Without this data, a video frame footprint cannot be calculated. Note: If your sensor is secured to the airborne platform, and is not using a Gimbal, then Sensor Relative Azimuth, Elevation and Roll are not required. The parameters above are well described in the MISB standards document. You can download the zip file titled MISP-2016.1 from the MISB website, unzip the file and look for a folder called MISP-2016.1CompositeDocuments. Within that folder is a PDF called ST0601.9.pdf, which contains a reference to all of the MISB fields supported by the FMV tool set. It also includes descriptions of the parameters and useful diagrams. Assuming you have all the required metadata, one of the most important steps in formatting your metadata for the Multiplexer tool is making sure the Precision Time stamp is in UNIX Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), in microseconds, with 16 digits with no decimal places. If your time stamp is currently in human-readable format (e.g. 3/13/2018 4:15:03 PM) and you need to convert it to UNIX, you can use an online tool or an Excel formula. For accurate results, your existing timestamps should include date and time with seconds (dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss). The Epoch Converter converts human-readable timestamps to UNIX timestamps individually or in batches. Copy/paste your timestamp rows from your Excel sheet into the batch converter and choose to export the UNIX results to a CSV file. You can then simply copy/paste the new UNIX timestamps back into your metadata file. * Note that the Epoch Converter generates results in milliseconds rather than microseconds. You must multiply the results by 1,000 to convert to microseconds, a requirement for the Multiplexer tool. If you don’t want to do a batch conversion or your video is too long to fit into the batch converter, you can manually calculate the UNIX timestamp in your Excel document using a simple formula. This is great if you have video frames with distinct time stamps. If you can’t use the Excel formula method because you have multiple frames with the same time stamp, you can use an interpolation method to get a smoother, slicker video output. Make sure your UTC Precision Time stamps have no decimal places and are not using scientific format (e.g. 1.459E+15). To do this, format the cells as “Number” and change the number of decimal places to 0. To wrap it up, here are some final tips to remember when working with the Multiplexer tool: Make sure you check out the Full Motion Video tutorials for guided instruction on working with geo-enabled videos in ArcGIS Pro.

                "content": "Україна – Центр ресурсів Ukraine – Resources Hub MENU Download our App There are numerous secure camera apps on the market, some of which are designed to record sensitive information such as human rights violations. However, if you are taking photos and videos in the hopes of convicting perpetrators in court, then not all camera apps are up to the task. The reason is courts require proof that the footage shows what you claim it does. A specialised camera app can help with this. However, if you use an app that is not designed for legal proceedings, your videos and photos could be disregarded as unreliable. Very often, unreliability comes down to discrepancies and errors with the photo or video’s metadata. Metadata summarises a photo or video’s basic information. For example, the footage’s time and location, and the device it was taken with. Metadata is important because it can verify that the footage was taken when and where the photographer says it was. It can also show that the footage has not been tampered with. Accurate and unaltered metadata is fundamental to reliability. As such, you need to choose a camera app that captures metadata in the right way. The not-for-profit eyeWitness to Atrocities developed its eyeWitness app to meet this challenge. As the only secure camera app created by legal experts, the eyeWitness app collects and stores metadata in a unique way that adheres to the toughest legal requirements. It also helps to protect its users’ identities by not collecting personally identifiable information. This article outlines what metadata eyeWitness collects; how eyeWitness captures, stores and transmits metadata; and, finally, how eyeWitness protects your privacy. Our extensive legal research has identified that the key information for verification includes the footage’s location, date and time. We also know that more metadata is not always better when it comes to use in court. The opposing counsel could use any incorrect or inconsistent metadata to discredit the integrity of the footage itself. As such, the eyeWitness app does not capture information that cannot be recorded consistently. For these reasons, the eyeWitness app collects the following: Many camera apps capture similar data. However, as explained below, not all apps capture it in a way that stands up in court. One of the biggest problems with camera apps (including the standard camera on your phone) is that they do not always record location, time and date accurately. Here are common problems with some camera apps: To overcome these problems, eyeWitness does the following: eyeWitness presents all of this complicated raw data in a clear, readable format for its partners. We even plot GPS, WiFi, and cell tower locations on a map. Figure 1 Where eyeWitness sources metadata from Altitude is an example of unreliable data. Because mobile devices are not altimeters, they are not capable of recording altitude with accuracy. Similarly, other data points such as speed or bearing are not helpful in demonstrating your footage is reliable. As we have said, courts require proof that no one has tampered with the footage at any point. In legal terms, this is called protecting the chain of custody. This is due to the risks of individuals editing and altering media and data to create fake evidence. If your camera app allows you to export and download your footage and metadata, then you have the ability to change them. The chain of custody is broken, and they will no longer be reliable on their own. Consequently, they will require corroboration such as your testimony in court. eyeWitness guarantees that all footage cannot be edited or altered, thus ensuring the chain of custody is intact. It does this in four ways: Firstly, as soon as you take the footage, the eyeWitness app automatically generates a unique identifying code known as a “hash value”. This hash value serves as a digital fingerprint. This step ensures that any subsequent changes to the footage can be detected. Secondly, eyeWitness does not allow you to upload footage taken from another camera app or device. The reason is eyeWitness cannot prove that the footage was not altered prior to being uploaded. Thirdly, the app does not allow you to immediately download or export your footage. Instead, the app asks you to upload the original photo or video to the secure, encrypted eyeWitness server, where we can protect the chain of custody for you. Once eyeWitness receives the footage, you automatically keep a copy that you then can download and export as normal. Fourthly, and finally, eyeWitness stores footage securely. All footage taken through the app is stored in an encrypted storage area within the eyeWitness app itself, separate from your phone gallery. The eyeWitness server that users upload their footage to is encrypted, secure, and access controlled. Figure 2 eyeWitness stores all footage in a separate gallery that can only be accessed using a 6 digit pin Importantly, eyeWitness also provides a thorough explanation of its technology and processes so courts can understand how eyeWitness ensures the chain of custody. When it comes to monitoring atrocities and human rights abuses, you do not want your camera app to capture any identifiable information about you. eyeWitness does not collect any identifying information unless you voluntarily provide it. The eyeWitness app collects the following information about you and your device: We do not collect device IMEI numbers, MAC addresses, or IP addresses from which you submit your footage. You also need to ensure that all of your footage is encrypted and secure. As stated previously, all footage you take using the eyeWitness app is encrypted when stored and transmitted. To find out more about metadata, take a look at our articles on Witness.org: Part 1 ‘Understanding the data points that apps collect, and how they are generated’, and Part 2 ‘Understanding the limitations of metadata when it is used for legal purposes’.

But an A.P. analysis and experts say a wayward finned creature was indeed captured on video swimming on a street in Fort Myers, Fla., this week.\nBy Daniel Victor\nTo professional fact-checkers who sort fact from fable on social media, Hurricane Shark has been a longtime nemesis.\nFor more than a decade, fake, grainy images of a shark swimming in waters it doesn’t belong in — usually a highway and a subway platform — have reliably circulated during nearly every major storm.\nIt was never real. Yet it kept coming up, shared without skepticism yet again, and the checkers of facts were forced to defeat it again, over and over.\nSo you can imagine their hesitant surprise when a new video emerged on Wednesday appearing to show a shark in a backyard near Fort Myers, Fla., which had been battered by Hurricane Ian and was beginning to flood. Though this video didn’t have the telltale signs of fakery that previous versions did, skepticism was warranted as it racked up millions of views on Twitter.\nThen evidence began emerging that it might actually be real. And on Thursday, both Storyful, a news agency, and The Associated Press confirmed its authenticity with interviews and examinations of the original clip’s metadata, nailing down a story reporters thought they would never write.\nIt was like discovering Bigfoot is real.\n“After over half a decade of debunking this hoax every time there was a flood or hurricane, I can’t believe I’m looking at an honest-to-god street shark,” wrote Jane Lytvynenko, a freelance reporter. “Good to finally meet you, pal.”\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

So when a video purporting to show a shark in an inundated backyard in Fort Myers, Fla., surfaced during Hurricane Ian this week, gathering millions of views on Twitter, viewers were skeptical.\nBut this time, the recording was real — even if there is no confirmation yet that what it depicted was a shark, according to Storyful, which first authenticated the video, and the Associated Press. The news agencies interviewed Dominic Cameratta, a real estate agent who filmed it with his cellphone, and reviewed the clip’s metadata to confirm it was recorded this week.\nThe video shows a fish that looks to be 4 feet long, with sharp dorsal fins, flipping and flopping in the water. “I didn’t know what it was,” Cameratta said. “I zoomed in, and all my friends were like, ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nExperts interviewed by the AP voiced mixed opinions on whether it was indeed a shark. George Burgess, a former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark program, said the fish appears to be a juvenile shark. But Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami’s shark conservation program, said it was difficult to tell what it was.\nWhat’s been happening with animals in Florida during Hurricane Ian?\nImages purportedly showing sharks in urban areas after hurricanes and major floods have been repeatedly debunked since at least 2011, according to Snopes, a fact-checking website.\nOne image of a shark swimming along a flooded highway was uploaded after Hurricane Irene hit Puerto Rico in August 2011. The same image has been widely recirculated after subsequent storms in different areas: In 2016, it was in Daytona Beach, Fla.; a year later, in Houston; and in 2018, it was in Wrightsville Beach, N.C.\nSnopes reported that the original image from 2011 also was a hoax. It incorporated a 2005 photograph of a kayaker being trailed by a great white shark.\nHurricane Ian has devastated Florida, killing at least 23 people, according to state officials. It made its second landfall in the United States on Friday, hitting coastal South Carolina as a Category 1 storm with lashing rains and strong winds.",

But a cellphone video filmed during Hurricane Ian's assault on southwest Florida isn't just another fish story. The eye-popping video, which showed a large, dark fish with sharp dorsal fins thrashing around an inundated Fort Myers backyard, racked up more than 12 million views on Twitter within a day, as users responded with disbelief and comparisons to the \"Sharknado\" film series. Dominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer, confirmed he filmed the clip from his back patio Wednesday morning when he saw something \"flopping around\" in his neighbor's flooded yard. \"I didn't know what it was—it just looked like a fish or something,\" he told The Associated Press. \"I zoomed in, and all my friends are like, 'It's like a shark, man!' \" He guessed the fish was about 4 feet in length. Experts were of mixed opinion on whether the clip showed a shark or another large fish. George Burgess, former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History's shark program, said in an email that it \"appears to be a juvenile shark,\" while Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, director of the University of Miami's shark conservation program, wrote that \"it's pretty hard to tell.\" Nevertheless, some Twitter users dubbed the hapless fish the \"street shark.\" The surge worsened in Fort Myers as the day went on. Cameratta said the flooding had only just begun when the clip was taken, but that the waters were \"all the way up to our house\" by the time the AP reached him by phone Wednesday evening. He said the fish may have made its way up from nearby Hendry Creek into a retention pond, which then overflowed, spilling the creature into his neighbor's backyard. A visual analysis of nearby property confirmed it matches the physical landmarks in the video. Leslie Guelcher, a professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, was among the online sleuths who initially thought the video was fake. \"Don't think this is real. According to the index on the video it was created in June 2010. Someone else posted it at 10 AM as in Fort Myers, but the storm surge wasn't like that at 10 AM,\" she tweeted Wednesday. Guelcher acknowledged later, though, that online tools she and others were using to establish the video's origins didn't actually show when the video itself was created, merely when the social media profile of the user was created. The AP confirmed through the original clip's metadata that it was captured Wednesday morning. \"It makes a bit more sense from a flooding standpoint,\" she said by email, when informed the fish was spotted near an overflowing pond. \"But how on earth would a shark go from the Gulf of Mexico to a retention pond?\" Yannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, said that most sharks flee shallow bays ahead of hurricanes, possibly tipped off to their arrival by a change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he said, or been washed into it. \"Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters—rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments—and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,\" Burgess said. \"Assuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.\" Cameratta sent the video to a group chat on WhatsApp on Wednesday morning, according to his friend John Paul Murray, who sent the AP a timestamped screenshot. \"Amazing content,\" Murray wrote in reply. © 2022 The Associated Press.
