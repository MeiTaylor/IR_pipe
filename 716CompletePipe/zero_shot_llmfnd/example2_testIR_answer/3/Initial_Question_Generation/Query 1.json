                    "content": "Man films fish ‘flopping around’ in neighbour’s garden but experts are split over identification\nPhotos and videos of sharks and other marine life swimming in suburban floodwaters make for popular hoaxes during heavy storms. But a mobile phone video filmed during Hurricane Ian’s assault on south-west Florida isn’t just another fishy story.\nThe video, which showed a large, dark fish with distinct dorsal fins thrashing around an inundated Fort Myers back yard, racked up more than 12m views on Twitter within a day, as users responded with disbelief and comparisons to the “Sharknado” film series.\nDominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer, confirmed he filmed the clip from his patio on Wednesday morning when he saw something “flopping around” in his neighbour’s flooded yard.\n“I didn’t know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,” he said. “I zoomed in, and all my friends are like: ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nHe guessed the fish was about 1.2 metres (4ft) long.\nExperts were divided over whether the clip showed a shark or another large fish. George Burgess, the former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark programme, said in an email that it “appears to be a juvenile shark”, while Dr Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami’s shark conservation programme, wrote that “it’s pretty hard to tell”.\nNevertheless, some Twitter users dubbed the hapless fish the “street shark”.\nCameratta said the flooding had only just begun when the video was taken, but that the waters were “all the way up to our house” by the time the Associated Press reached him by phone on Wednesday evening.\nHe said the fish may have made its way up from nearby Hendry Creek into a retention pond, which then overflowed, spilling the creature into his neighbour’s back yard. A visual analysis of nearby property confirmed it matches the physical landmarks in the video.\nLeslie Guelcher, a professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, was among the online sleuths who initially thought the video was fake.\n“Don’t think this is real. According to the index on the video it was created in June 2010. Someone else posted it at 10am as in Fort Myers, but the storm surge wasn’t like that at 10am,” she tweeted on Wednesday.\nGuelcher acknowledged later, though, that online tools she and others were using to establish the video’s origins didn’t actually show when the video itself was created, merely when the social media profile of the user was created.\nThe AP confirmed through the original clip’s metadata that it was captured on Wednesday morning.\n“It makes a bit more sense from a flooding standpoint,” Guelcher said by email, when informed the fish was spotted near an overflowing pond. “But how on earth would a shark go from the Gulf of Mexico to a retention pond?”\nYannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, said most sharks leave shallow bays ahead of hurricanes, possibly tipped off to their arrival by a change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he said, or been washed into it.\n“Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters – rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments – and often appear in similar videos in Florida water bodies connected to the sea, such as coastal canals and ponds,” Burgess said. “Assuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.”\nCameratta sent the video to a group chat on WhatsApp on Wednesday morning, according to his friend John Paul Murray, who sent the AP a timestamped screenshot.",

Climate change may increase the risk of infections from the deadly bacteria farther north.\nBy Amelia Nierenberg\nThree people in the New York City area have died in recent weeks and a fourth person was hospitalized after contracting infections from a flesh-eating bacteria that can be caused by eating raw oysters or swimming in saltwater, health officials in New York and Connecticut said.\nInfections from the bacteria, called Vibrio vulnificus, are rare but extremely dangerous. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that one in five people who become infected die. Many survivors lose limbs to amputations, according to the C.D.C.\n“We are reminding providers to be on the lookout for cases of vibriosis, which is not often the first diagnosis that comes to mind,” Dr. James McDonald, the New York state health commissioner said in a statement on Wednesday.\nPeople with open wounds should avoid swimming in warm seawater, he said. And people with compromised immune systems should be careful with eating or handling raw seafood.\nOne of the New York area deaths was in Suffolk County, on Long Island; two others were in Connecticut. In the fourth case, also in Connecticut, a person was sickened but later released from the hospital. \nVibriosis is caused by several species of bacteria, including the Vibrio vulnificus bacteria, which can be found in salt water, especially when the weather is warm, New York health officials said. Symptoms include diarrhea, stomach cramps, vomiting, fever and chills. Exposure can also result in ear infections and cause sepsis and life-threatening wound infections.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
