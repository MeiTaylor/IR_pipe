Shane Daniel Water Quality in the Los Angeles River: A Remote Sensing Based Analysis Advisor: Elisabeth Sedano | Committee Members: Robert Vos, John Wilson Abstract Text (click to show/hide) Approximately 11 miles of concrete channelized Los Angeles River (LAR) are planned to be restored to natural riverbed with engineered banks by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) working with the City of Los Angeles. Recent studies centered on urban watersheds in Southern California focus primarily on pollutants without addressing the effects of artificial riverbed substrate on water quality (WQ). Departing from the field collection methodologies employed by previous studies in the LAR, this project is a systematic remote sensing (RS) based investigation of differences in WQ found between natural and concrete riverbed environments in the LAR. Two RS indices are applied to aerial imagery to assess relative WQ in the LAR: Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference turbidity index (NDTI). National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery is integrated with NDVI to measure chlorophyll-a concentration and NDTI to determine turbidity levels as parameters to gauge WQ. Results indicate that natural riverbed sections typically contain lower NDTI values than concrete sections, suggesting these environments abate turbidity. NDVI results detect statistically significant differences in chlorophyll-a concentration between water in concrete and natural sections that may be the product of several variables deserving further study. The RS methodology herein provides a framework for monitoring of WQ parameters in the LAR. Provision of a dense dataset of WQ parameters existing in concrete and natural riverbed zones fills a critical knowledge gap regarding the poorly studied effects of the artificial substrate. Examples of natural riverbed sections in the LAR with engineered banks harboring reduced turbidity, while providing adequate flood protection for decades, supports the argument that expanded restoration is both environmentally advantageous and safe for surrounding communities. Thesis PDF Christopher S. Hayner Exploring the Pernicious Effects of Redlining and Discriminatory Policies on American Cities:A Spatio-Temporal Case Study Exploring New York City Advisor: Elisabeth Sedano | Committee Members: Darren Ruddell, Robert Vos Abstract Text (click to show/hide) In the summer of 2020, sustained violence against Black Americans by law enforcement erupted into nationwide protests following the callous murder of George Floyd. The cultural zeitgeist prompted a call to action, not only to rethink our policing, but also to examine larger systemic and institutionalized racism in our society. In urban planning circles, this discussion often begins with an examination of the role \u201credlining\u201d maps created in the 1930s by the federal government, which controversially appraised lending risk with a racial lens, stigmatizing areas with Black residents, outlined in red, as risky for investment, and contributing to ensuing segregation. Through examination of the nation\u2019s largest metropolis, New York, this thesis evaluates whether redlining was only one factor of government policy \u2013 federal or municipal \u2013 entrenching segregation in the landscape. Global and local spatial clustering and segregation measures were conducted in 10-year intervals from 1910 to 2020 to evaluate underlying shifts in the spatial patterns of Black and White population segments over time. Linear regression, spatial error, and spatial lag models were then constructed to evaluate the degree to which redlining, urban renewal designations, public housing concentrations, zoning designations and historic districting contributed to the spatial segregation of Black and White populations in three distinct years: 1960, 1990 and 2020. The findings showed each era of new urban planning policy contributed to persisting segregation. The findings also showed that oftentimes a new generation of policy would spatially reference a prior era, to the benefit or detriment of a particular population: Urban renewal designations mimicked redlined areas and disproportionately concentrated public housing into increasingly Black enclaves, while exclusionary zoning tools like single-family zoning, often mimicked the safest investment designations in redlining maps, prolonging the privilege of predominantly White communities. Thesis PDF Melissa Khatry Rails to Trails Web Mapping Application for the Great Redwood Trails: Mapping Northern California\u2019s Repurposed Trails Advisor: Elisabeth Sedano | Committee Members: Leilei Duan, Jennifer Swift Abstract Text (click to show/hide) Many online applications exist that allow users to search for hiking trails, but none have yet included the new Great Redwood Trail project that spans from San Francisco to Humboldt Bay in California. This \u201crails to trails\u201d project is repurposing 320 miles of historic railway tracks in northwest California into public hiking trails. The new trails exemplify a positive relationship between human-created infrastructure and nature. Rather than creating more industrial waste, the Great Redwood Trail Agency is revitalizing the railway tracks for the purpose of promoting environmentalism and activeness in nature. For this project a mobile web mapping application was developed to familiarize hikers and the public with these trails. The Great Redwood Trail application provides and interactive digital map of the trails and includes relevant information and points of interest in surrounding areas aimed at stimulating the local economy, which is vital in garnering community support for trail development. Lastly, the app includes real-time wildfire information since this is now an incessant natural hazard in the Northern California region. Ultimately, this project aspires to showcase repurposed railways to hiking trails, promote local communities, and help ensure safety of app users. Thesis PDF Alejandra G.

In December 2021, the most destructive winter tornado outbreak, known as the Quad-State Tornado Outbreak, caused 89 fatalities, 672 injuries, and at least $3.9 billion in property damages. Scientists at the University of Miami\u2019s Cooperative Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) and NOAA\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) investigated this outbreak and found that it occurred under an exceptionally strong and prolonged negative Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern, which created favorable conditions for tornado outbreaks. July 2, 2024 Tropical Cyclone Freddy breaks records as the longest-lasting cyclone on record. Spanning 36 days, it traveled from the Australia to Africa, nearly 33% of the Earth\u2019s circumference. July 1, 2024 A new study spanning two decades of research may indicate a series of reefs from the surface to 150 meters deep in the Gulf of Mexico are more resilient to warmer oceans as they are exposed to a wider range of temperatures brought on by a physical movement of seawater called \u201ceddies.\u201d June 27, 2024 In May 2024, representatives from the Hurricane Modeling Team at NOAA\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) hosted a Summer Colloquium focused on equipping the next generation of hurricane scientists with a knowledge base of the HAFS model. June 4, 2024 With an active hurricane season on the horizon, the need for reliable hurricane forecasting is at the forefront of our minds. Heightened sea surface temperatures, weakened vertical wind shear, and an enhanced West African monsoon are expected to contribute to the development of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic. To predict these developing storms, meteorologists employ models that rely on current observations and mathematical calculations to predict a storm\u2019s behavior and track. These models are complex and utilize inputs from a variety of sources including historic, numeric, oceanic, and atmospheric data to generate their predictions. May 8, 2024 Blue lights fill the room. The faint smell of salt emanates throughout the space as wires and tubes intricately suspended over robotic arms move along custom-built tracks over four rows of tanks filled with seawater \u2013 and fragments of critically-endangered corals. In the Experimental Reef Lab, scientists at NOAA\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) and the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) are investigating how crucial reef-building coral species are affected by the impacts of climate change using a suite of open-source robotic arms designed and built at AOML. May 2, 2024 Floating ice, freezing temperatures, and streaks of lights in the night sky. The I08S GO-SHIP cruise successfully concluded on April 1st. April 30, 2024 Improvements in the operational Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting Model paved the way for tropical cyclone prediction and modeling by lowering intensity forecast errors by 45-50%. April 22, 2024 Wind, waves, and icebergs pierced through morning fog \u2013 the A13.5 GO-SHIP cruise proved both tumultuous and rewarding with vast amounts of new data that bring the promise of groundbreaking future research. After 52 days at sea, the A13.5 GO-SHIP cruise (short for \u201cGlobal Ocean Ship-based Hydrographical Investigations Program\u201d) returned to Cape Town, South Africa [\u2026] April 18, 2024 Just in! A new study, which analyzed mooring observations and hydrographic data, found the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) abyssal limb in the North Atlantic has weakened over the past two decades contributing to sea level rise in the region. March 19, 2024 In a groundbreaking new study, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) scientists unveiled a significant advancement in hurricane tracking and forecasting. The study, named \u201cThe G-IV Inner Circumnavigation: A Story of Successful Organic Interactions Between Research and Operations at NOAA,\u201d discusses how scientists across NOAA are improving hurricane forecasts through the effective use of NOAA [\u2026] March 18, 2024 Chris Kelble, Ph.D. will serve as a Federal Coordinating Lead Author on first-ever National Nature Assessment (NAA). March 12, 2024 Meet NOAA Corps Officer, LTJG Anna Gaskill In honor of Women\u2019s History Month, NOAA\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) spoke with our NOAA Corps Officer, LTJG Anna Gaskill, about her career at NOAA and her advice for women considering opportunities with the NOAA Corps. Anna currently serves as the AOML Operations Manager, primarily coordinating [\u2026] February 15, 2024 In honor of Black History Month, NOAA\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) spoke with Oceanographer Kayelyn Simmons, PhD, about her role at AOML and what Black History Month means to her. Kayelyn is a federal oceanographer at AOML, leading benthic habitat characterization studies using 3D mapping with the Ocean Chemistry and Ecosystems Division. Her [\u2026] February 13, 2024 Scientists at NOAA\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) are gearing up for a busy season at sea with three research cruises departing in the month of February. The A13.5 Global Ocean Ship-based Hydrographic Investigations Program (GO-SHIP) cruise, the I08S GO-SHIP cruise, and the Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) Northeast Extension cruise will all depart in February to collect samples from the surface to the depths of the ocean and improve our understanding of ocean circulation, carbon uptake, biological conditions, and climate variability. February 7, 2024 Congratulations to AOML\u2019s 2024 Department of Commerce Medal winners! AOML is proud to recognize the achievements of our outstanding scientists for their vital contributions to better understand the Earth systems and protecting our nation. January 25, 2024 Changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and its transport of heat can affect climate and weather patterns, regional sea levels, and ecosystems. A new study led by Ivenis Pita, a University of Miami PhD student working at NOAA\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory/ the Cooperative Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS), is the first to estimate the AMOC and heat transport at 22.5\u00b0S in the South Atlantic, demonstrating the importance of sustained in situ observations to monitor the state of the AMOC.
