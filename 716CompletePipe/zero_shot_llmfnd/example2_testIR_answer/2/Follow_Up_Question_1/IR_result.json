Introduction - (includes as one file Contents, Acknowledgements, Purpose, Materials and Methods, History of Research, Fisheries, Geography, Climate, Habitats, Environmental Change, Drainage Basins, Scientific Names, Fish Structure, Collecting Fishes, Preserving Fishes, Checklists, Glossaries, and Quotes). Note that Voume 1 of Carps and Minnows of Iran (see below for link) repeats and expands on these entries. 2. Species Accounts a. Description + Acipenseridae b. Cobitidae + Nemacheilidae + Salmonidae + Cyprinodontidae; c. Sparidae+ Cichlidae + Gobiidae. 3. Bibliography 1711-2013 (note the papers listed in Published Accounts have updated bibliographies and contain references not found here). 4. Published Accounts The families Adrianichthyidae (Oryzias latipes), Percichthyidae (Morone saxatilis), Centrarchidae (Lepomis macrochirus and Micropterus salmoides), Mullidae (Mullus barbatus), Scophthalmidae (Psetta maxima) and Pleuronectidae (Platichthys flesus) are deleted from this work as the species therein have not been confirmed from Iran (see Coad and Abdoli (1993b) for some details). Revised sections of this website appeared as review articles in the Iranian Journal of Ichthyology (http://ijichthyol.org/) and the International Journal of Aquatic Biology (www. ij-aquaticbiology.com), both published by the Iranian Society of Ichthyology. These families are no longer accessible here and will not be updated further. Note that the species formerly in the family Cyprinidae are now assigned to seven families in Iran. The less speciose families are published as journal articles. The two largest families (carps or Cyprinidae and minnows or Leuciscidae) appear here as downloadable files. A more permanent home will eventually be found these latter two as their size precludes publishing in book form for cost reasons (both to produce the books and their probable retail price).

Some sections of this work are incomplete but have been posted as is. They will be updated and queries resolved as time permits. Apart from files not yet complete, distribution maps, some figures and habitat photographs are the main items to be added. A question mark may appear in the text appended to items that need to be checked by me. Numerous queries have led me to post incomplete material. This work has been carried out over a period of 45 years, starting in 1971. I arrived in Iran in January 1976 and, in that year, 7 articles were published strictly on Iranian fishes (3 on parasites, 1 on pesticides, 1 on fisheries, 1 describing the blind white fish and 1 a summary of the latter; 2 were in Farsi). A generation later in 2006, over 160 articles on Iranian fishes appeared, along with hundreds of relevant works from neighbouring countries, works on the aquatic environment in Iran and works on taxonomy and systematics relevant to Iran. The study of fishes is now a very active field within Iran and the Middle East and much of the newer literature is easily available on-line (see Bibliography). Accordingly, 2011 is the last year that this work was updated although some systematic and taxonomic studies may still be incorporated. The Published Accounts (see above) were updated versions from content in this website. Acknowledgements A wide range of people in Iran, Canada and elsewhere have assisted me in this work over more than 40 years. Inevitably, I will have forgotten some names, which I regret. Some people I never met formally, an example being the gentleman nattily dressed in suit by a stream near Kazerun who jumped fully-clothed into the water to help me catch fish. Numerous other Iranians have assisted my studies and this website is dedicated to them. The staff at the Department of Biology, Shiraz (then Pahlavi) ... [Content truncated]",

        "Question": "What visual indicators in the video can help confirm the presence of a shark on the flooded highway during Hurricane Ian, considering past instances of mistaken identities during similar events as referenced in the provided QA_CONTEXTS?",
        "Answer": "To determine the presence of a shark on a flooded highway during Hurricane Ian in the video, we can look for specific visual indicators that are characteristic of sharks to confirm their presence. Considering past instances of mistaken identities during similar events, the following visual indicators can help confirm the presence of a shark:\n\n1. **Body Shape**: Sharks have a unique body shape with a pointed snout, gill slits, fins, and a streamlined body structure. Observing these specific features in the video can indicate the presence of a shark [Query 1_evidence_1].\n\n2. **Tail Fin**: The distinct shape and movement of a shark's tail fin can be a key identifier. Look for a crescent-shaped tail fin with a clear distinction from the body shape, which is a common characteristic of sharks [Query 1_evidence_1].\n\n3. **Behavior**: Sharks exhibit specific behaviors while swimming, such as swift movements and occasional surfacing for air. Observing such behaviors in the video can support the identification of a shark in the flooded highway [Query 1_evidence_1].\n\n4. **Size Comparison**: Comparing the size of the suspected shark to its surroundings can also provide insight. Sharks are generally larger in size compared to other objects in the water. If the object in question appears significantly larger than other debris, it may indicate a shark [Query 1_evidence_1].\n\nConsidering these visual indicators and the past instances of mistaken identities mentioned in the provided QA_CONTEXTS, it is crucial to carefully analyze the video for these specific features to confirm the presence of a shark. The presence of multiple indicators aligning with shark characteristics would increase the likelihood of the object being a shark during Hurricane Ian.",
