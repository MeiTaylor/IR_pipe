It's that time in New Hampshire and all over New England\u00a0where we (and our cars)\u00a0have to endure: pothole season.\nWe all know that feeling of driving down the road after a winter of plowing, snow, and sleet, and playing dodgeball with all the holes in the roads, especially here in New England with the small towns and roads that never even see a plow.\nIn Lee, for instance, one of the prettiest towns in New Hampshire, the roads can be full of holes. \u00a0You never know where the biggest ones are either, because they always look the same on the surface.\nSome of them are only\u00a0two or three inches deep, but it varies so much. \u00a0You can never really tell how deep one is until you hit one, and your tire, if not flat, has a gash that needs repair. You and I know that you can rarely replace just one tire. \u00a0You gotta do at least two.\nLucky us (sarcasm here), we are in for it even worse than we might think, and you can blame it on a couple of things.\nAccording to the National Weather Service Boston, July was one of the wettest months in history in the Boston area. \u00a0Rain breaks down roadway surfaces, whether it is made out of asphalt or dirt, which leads to the second reason why.\nThe temperature changes create a void under the pavement and could collect more water, a pothole fact sheet from the Metropolitan Transportation Committee in California stated. If it happens over and over, the void can increase.\nNow, combine that with all the cars that continuously drive over the weakened spot, and you come up with a potentially massive hole in the road.\nCBS News reported that in Boston alone, there were over 7,000 potholes filled in 2023. And that's just Boston. Now imagine what 2024 might be.\nNBC 10 News\u00a0stated that AAA has reported that the rain and freezing temps in January is already contributing to an earlier start to pothole season.\nAccording to Autoinsurance.com, \"The Northeast has the highest potholes per capita at 24 percent more than the national average.\" Get ready, it seems.\nA good suggestion to be prepared for a damaged tire is to keep a good spare in the car. \u00a0This wouldn't help me, however, because I can't change a tire.\nGood luck to us all!\nGallery Credit: Stacker",

Caption: it is no ordinary dog that is merely black, but\u2026. The Black Dog. Here I have to specify that \u2018Black Dog\u2019 as used throughout this article does not refer simply to domestic dogs that are black, but to a specific sort of frightening, monstrous creature that has the form of a very large, black, shaggy-coated dog, is mostly associated with rural roads, town edges and green places, and which is described as atypical relative to domestic dogs and, furthermore, able to generate an unusual amount of fear in those who encounter it. In discussing the Black Dog, we almost certainly aren\u2019t talking about an actual animal or race of animals but instead some kind of folkloric or cultural entity, perhaps meaning that this article is out of place on a blog devoted to zoology. But read on. The Black Dog is a creature of contradiction, stories variously describing it as a malevolent or menacing presence, as an associate of witchcraft, Satanic goings-on, or the afterlife, as Satan himself, as a terrifying, hellish beast that can burn and even kill, as an omen or portent associated with misfortune or impending death, as a benign, known and regular feature of the landscape, or even as a guardian or protector. Caption: at least some renditions of Black Dogs (I think made without reference to the actual accounts) show them as hound-like and short-coated. At left, the spectral hound of the Baskervilles as illustrated by Sidney Paget for the 1901-1902 serialisation of Conan Doyle\u2019s The Hound of the Baskervilles. At right, a Black Dog as visualised by Gino D\u2019Achille for the cover of Janet and Colin Bord\u2019s 1981 Alien Animals. Names and their alleged origins. A large number of local names are attached to the Black Dog, those from Britain including Barguest, Black Shuck, Capelthwaite, Galley Trot, Gurt Dog, Hairy Jack, Hooter, Old Scarpe, Old Shock, Padfoot, Scarfe, Shucky Dog, Shug Monster, Skeff, Skriker, Striker and Trash. Numerous efforts to find the etymologies of these names exist; in his Mystery Animals of Britain and Ireland, Graham McEwan (1986) reviewed suggestions that certain of them might have their roots in old words associated with gnawing or biting, with Satan, with words for spirit, ghost, elf, or shining, with howling, with the noisy \u2018striking\u2019 or \u2018sloshing\u2019 sounds of the Black Dog\u2019s feet, with the shagginess of its coat, with the bear-like appearance of the Black Dog, with the Black Dog\u2019s association with towns, barrows, hills or funeral processions, or with its role as a guardian of treasure (McEwan 1986). Caption: 17th century images of the Black Dog of Newgate Prison, London. This monstrous creature was said to have a massive chain around its neck and to be associated with executions or with the avenging of the death of a sorcerer\u2026 it\u2019s all complicated and confusing. A book called The Discovery of a London Monster Called the Black Dog of Newgate was published about the case in 1638. This diversity of associations makes me wonder if people were ever really describing the same one thing. I mean: if names used for specific, regional variants of the Black Dog really are meant to be synonymous with \u2018town ghost\u2019, \u2018hill ghost\u2019, \u2018barrow ghost\u2019 or \u2018treasure guardian\u2019, I\u2019m inclined to think that \u2018Black Dog\u2019 is better imagined as a synonym of \u2018amorphous dark non-humanoid phantom\u2019. Having said that, a good number of the tales and accounts really do describe big, black, shaggy-coated dog-like animals, and it\u2019s those accounts I\u2019m interested in. Black Dogs are generally large: mostly bigger than a familiar dog like a German shepherd or Labrador, and quite often said to be exceptionally big, some accounts describing them as being as tall as a table or the size of a calf. The eyes are often said to be strikingly large, and to glow, usually red. This is thought to reflect an internally generated, spectral glow and not be a reflection of lights held by the witness. A few accounts pertaining to Devon describe the Black Dog as headless and Black Shuck is said in some stories to only have one, centrally positioned eye. Caption: a Black Dog \u2013 of the sort recounted in the relevant tales \u2013 to scale with a person and a mid-size pet dog. Image: Darren Naish. Occasionally, there\u2019s mention of clanking or swinging chains around the Black Dog\u2019s neck, or of especially noisy paws that make a clattering, splashing or striking sound on the surface of the road. Baying or shrieking sounds are associated with some Black Dogs. A few accounts describe the animal opening its mouth to reveal a glowing interior, and sometimes glowing fumes or a mist emanates from the mouth too. One or two accounts make mention of a sulferous odour. Caption: at left, McEwan\u2019s Mystery Animals of Britain and Ireland, a very useful source of Black Dog information. At right: several smaller books discuss or recount various of the local Black Dog legends, and here\u2019s one of them. The places and the times. Black Dog stories and accounts come from essentially the whole of the British Isles, though there\u2019s the impression that Suffolk, East Anglia and Lincolnshire in the east, Devon in the west, and Yorkshire in the north-east are where the majority of accounts originate. The eponymous hound of Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s 1901-1902 The Hound of the Baskervilles, set on Dartmoor in Devon, was apparently based on the Yeth Hound, a legendary Black Dog local to the area. Caption: The Black Dog Inn in the village of Black Dog, Devon. Image from The Black Dog Inn website. Various places across Britain are named after the Black Dog, including certain roads, lanes, pubs, and the village Black Dog in Devon. I recently visited one such pub in my native Hampshire, though I remain unsure whether it was named for a proper Black Dog or just a Labrador ... [Content truncated]",
