                "content": "It happens every time there‚Äôs a hurricane ‚Äì the shark photos, memes, and old videos showing ‚Äòproof‚Äô that a shark (usually one that looks like a great white) is taking advantage of flooded streets and malls to search for‚Ä¶ well, who knows what. For years both journalists and shark scientists have had to put up with the deluge of fake images and videos, telling the public the same message: ‚Äúthis is fake.‚Äù In fact, even the Twitter page for Snopes has begged people to stop sharing the proven false photos and videos. So, it was to no one‚Äôs surprise when a video popped up after Hurricane Ian made landfall in Florida claiming to capture a shark in floodwaters.\nThis video, however, was different.\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,‚Äù Cameratta told news outlets. ... [+] ‚ÄúI zoomed in, and all my friends are like: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs like a shark, man!‚Äô‚Äù\nPast hoax videos usually showed sharks in flooded malls or swimming down highways, but this one seemed to be in someone‚Äôs backyard near Fort Myers, Florida. The fact that this was a new video garnered a lot of attention, racking up millions of views on Twitter. The skepticism was rampant ‚Äì and warranted. The first question many asked was, ‚ÄúIs this an actual video?‚Äù An answer quickly came with both Storyful and The Associated Press confirming its authenticity through examination of the video‚Äôs metadata and subsequent interviews. AP got the scoop from local real estate agent Dominic Cameratta, who confirmed he filmed the clip himself on Wednesday morning. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,‚Äù he told news outlets. ‚ÄúI zoomed in, and all my friends are like: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs like a shark, man!‚Äô‚Äù\nSo, the clip is real. But is that really a shark?\nIt‚Äôs hard to tell ‚Äì and even shark scientists are stumped. George Burgess, a former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History‚Äôs shark program, told the Washington Post that the fish in the video appears to be a juvenile shark. ‚ÄúYoung bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters ‚Äî rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments ‚Äî and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,‚Äù Burgess said. ‚ÄúAssuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.‚Äù\n‚ÄúYoung bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters ‚Äî rivers, estuaries, subtropical ... [+] embayments ‚Äî and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,‚Äù Burgess says.\nDr. Yannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, is on the fence about the video. Papastamatiou pointed to the science that shows many shark species are known to flee shallow, coastal regions ahead of hurricanes, possibly being tipped off to the giant storm‚Äôs arrival by a drastic change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he reckons, or been washed into it.\nBut Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami‚Äôs shark conservation program, isn‚Äôt as convinced, saying it was difficult to tell what exactly the fish was. It should be of note that the video caught the fish swimming near a pond that was overflowing, causing some experts to lean towards this just being an escapee.\nIt seems we will never have a definitive answer to this mystery. While shark experts are split over the identification, some Twitter users were convinced and have dubbed the grainy fish a ‚Äústreet shark.‚Äù Perhaps this is a new rendition for ‚ÄúBaby Shark‚Äù writers to pick up and write a song about?\n\nOne Community.

The VERIFY team has been fact-checking viral content to determine what‚Äôs real and what isn‚Äôt. Was an elephant seal seen scooting along a Florida sidewalk during Hurricane Ian? Florida just outta control right now üò≥ü¶≠ pic.twitter.com/LSJMf3bnIt The video, posted to Twitter on Sept. 28, had more than 12 million views. No, an elephant seal was not seen scooting along a Florida sidewalk during Hurricane Ian. The elephant seal video was taken in October 2020 in Puerto Cisnes, Chile. According to Infobae, an Argentinian news outlet, the elephant seal traveled 10 blocks in an area known as the largest urban center in the city of Puerto Cisnes, Chile. With the help of residents in the area, the seal was transported back to the ocean by the Chilean navy. The rescue mission was recorded live on Facebook in October 2020 by a local radio DJ.

When a hurricane hits Florida people do a party pic.twitter.com/B4Vaas2SFD The video clip, shared by multiple accounts on Sept. 28, had hundreds of thousands of views on Twitter. It had more than 1 million likes on TikTok. No, the video wasn‚Äôt taken during Ian. It was shared online multiple times before the storm made landfall in Florida, though it was taken in Fort Myers, Florida. Using RevEye, a reverse image search tool, VERIFY found several instances where the video was shared prior to Ian becoming a named storm. The video was posted on Reddit on Aug. 30. This 12-second video was posted to Facebook on Sept. 12. It was also posted on Imgur, an image and video sharing platform, on Sept. 15, about a week and a half before Ian made landfall. Using Google Maps Streetview, VERIFY was able to pinpoint the exact location where the video was taken ‚Äì from the rooftop of the Lani Kai Island Resort in Fort Myers Beach. The same buildings seen in the video can be seen from Google Maps. The same 7-11 convenience store can be seen across the street from the Lani Kai resort where the video was taken, and right across the street from that, the same blue building. Does this photo show a shark swimming on a Florida highway in Ian‚Äôs floodwaters? There are sharks on the highways in Florida. Unreal. pic.twitter.com/sHcgfkrc8o The photo, posted to Twitter on Sept. 28, had more than 28,000 retweets and over 300,000 likes. This photo circulates nearly each hurricane season. This example was shared in 2018 in connection to Hurricane Florence, which wreaked havoc on the Carolinas. Here it was shared during Hurricane Sandy, and here during Hurricane Irma. The image was actually lifted from a September 2005 issue of Africa Geographic. The original photo shows a shark trailing a kayaker, and was later manipulated to look like a shark was swimming through an interstate lane.

Flamingos evacuated to the bathroom at Sunken Gardens, St Pete.ü¶©ü¶© #hurricaneian pic.twitter.com/MX9wNGvzds Some people commenting on the photo claimed they had seen that image before the storm struck Florida on Sept. 28. This one is real! The flamingos are residents of Sunken Gardens park, a botanic park based out of St. Petersburg, Florida. The park tweeted the photo from their official account on Sept. 28, saying the flamingos were safe from the oncoming storm. ‚ÄúWe're hunkered down!

In August 1992, Hurricane Andrew, a Category 5 storm, hit Florida and at the time, Miami Zoo‚Äôs Ron Magill took a photo of flamingos huddled up. On the 30 year anniversary of Hurricane Andrew, Magill tweeted about the famous photo, writing, ‚ÄúOf the countless images I have captured in my life, none is more iconic than this one.

            "content": {
                "content": "When Hurricane Nicole hit Florida on Wednesday night with wind, rain and flooding battering the state, a common hoax resurfaced. A video of fin-like objects being swept down a flooded road on the Sunshine State's east coast sparked a joke that the objects were two sharks carried through the streets by the rushing water.\nThe Category 1 storm hit the coast that was already vulnerable from Hurricane Ian, which hammered the state six weeks ago. Residents were urged to evacuate in certain areas as floodwaters cascaded down roadways. As residents were evacuating, one video shows a car stopped at a flooded intersection and debris carried by the floodwaters rushing through the intersection.\nThe Instagram video, posted by user ohana_surf_shop on Wednesday morning, showed two fin-like objects swept along by floodwaters near an intersection where the user was stopped in his car. The video taker joked, \"There goes a shark, we've got a couple sharks,\" as the objects floated by. Another person in the car laughed during the video.\nThe post's caption said, \"Sharks on the streets!!\" and included hashtags for \"Sharknado,\" a made-for-TV science fiction comedy disaster movie that is commonly referenced when shark hoaxes resurface during hurricanes.\nStoryful, a social media intelligence agency, shared the video and said it was taken by Jordan Schwartz, a local man who owns Ohana Surf Shop in Stuart, Florida.\nThe video was taken after residents received evacuation orders when storm surges breached the coast and flooding overwhelmed local streets. Schwartz also recorded more debris transported by floodwaters down the roadway, including a kayak.\nSchwartz told Newsweek that at first, the debris did look like sharks.\n\"It looks real all the way through,\" he said in an Instagram message. \"So we were kinda in shock and [definitely] thought we had sharks at the beginning.\"\nSchwartz said that as soon as the debris floated past the car in front of him, he realized it wasn't a shark. He said he wasn't aware of the common shark hoaxes that surface during hurricanes when he took the video.\n\"Actually amazed how much feedback we got from this,\" he said.\nSchwartz shared the video twice on his Instagram page. The first was liked nearly 3,900 times and the second nearly 3,000 times.\nShark appearances are common hoaxes that originated in 2012 when a fake image of a shark was depicted swimming down a flooded highway. Since then, the image and others have surfaced on social media whenever a hurricane hits.\nMost recently, a man videoed what appeared to be a shark flopping around in his neighbor's backyard in Fort Myers, Florida, during severe storm surge from Hurricane Ian.\nAfter the video index was confirmed, experts said it's possible that a shark sensed a drop in barometric pressure that preceded the hurricane and, trying to flee, accidentally ended up in a retention pond which, when flooded, tossed the shark into someone's backyard. Storyful, a social media intelligence agency, verified the Fort Myers video was authentic but couldn't determine if the animal was actually a shark or a large fish.\nThe Hurricane Ian shark is an anomaly, and many shark-like objects sighted during hurricanes are later determined to be debris or fake images.\nUpdate 11/10/22, 11:04 a.m. ET: This story was updated with comment from Jordan Schwartz.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nAnna Skinner is a Newsweek senior reporter based in Indianapolis.

            "content": {
                "content": "Of the several phantasmal creatures associated with the British and European countryside, among the most widespread and ancient is the Black Dog... Caption: it is no ordinary dog that is merely black, but‚Ä¶. The Black Dog. Here I have to specify that ‚ÄòBlack Dog‚Äô as used throughout this article does not refer simply to domestic dogs that are black, but to a specific sort of frightening, monstrous creature that has the form of a very large, black, shaggy-coated dog, is mostly associated with rural roads, town edges and green places, and which is described as atypical relative to domestic dogs and, furthermore, able to generate an unusual amount of fear in those who encounter it. In discussing the Black Dog, we almost certainly aren‚Äôt talking about an actual animal or race of animals but instead some kind of folkloric or cultural entity, perhaps meaning that this article is out of place on a blog devoted to zoology. But read on. The Black Dog is a creature of contradiction, stories variously describing it as a malevolent or menacing presence, as an associate of witchcraft, Satanic goings-on, or the afterlife, as Satan himself, as a terrifying, hellish beast that can burn and even kill, as an omen or portent associated with misfortune or impending death, as a benign, known and regular feature of the landscape, or even as a guardian or protector. Caption: at least some renditions of Black Dogs (I think made without reference to the actual accounts) show them as hound-like and short-coated. At left, the spectral hound of the Baskervilles as illustrated by Sidney Paget for the 1901-1902 serialisation of Conan Doyle‚Äôs The Hound of the Baskervilles. At right, a Black Dog as visualised by Gino D‚ÄôAchille for the cover of Janet and Colin Bord‚Äôs 1981 Alien Animals. Names and their alleged origins. A large number of local names are attached to the Black Dog, those from Britain including Barguest, Black Shuck, Capelthwaite, Galley Trot, Gurt Dog, Hairy Jack, Hooter, Old Scarpe, Old Shock, Padfoot, Scarfe, Shucky Dog, Shug Monster, Skeff, Skriker, Striker and Trash. Numerous efforts to find the etymologies of these names exist; in his Mystery Animals of Britain and Ireland, Graham McEwan (1986) reviewed suggestions that certain of them might have their roots in old words associated with gnawing or biting, with Satan, with words for spirit, ghost, elf, or shining, with howling, with the noisy ‚Äòstriking‚Äô or ‚Äòsloshing‚Äô sounds of the Black Dog‚Äôs feet, with the shagginess of its coat, with the bear-like appearance of the Black Dog, with the Black Dog‚Äôs association with towns, barrows, hills or funeral processions, or with its role as a guardian of treasure (McEwan 1986). Caption: 17th century images of the Black Dog of Newgate Prison, London. This monstrous creature was said to have a massive chain around its neck and to be associated with executions or with the avenging of the death of a sorcerer‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all complicated and confusing. A book called The Discovery of a London Monster Called the Black Dog of Newgate was published about the case in 1638. This diversity of associations makes me wonder if people were ever really describing the same one thing. I mean: if names used for specific, regional variants of the Black Dog really are meant to be synonymous with ‚Äòtown ghost‚Äô, ‚Äòhill ghost‚Äô, ‚Äòbarrow ghost‚Äô or ‚Äòtreasure guardian‚Äô, I‚Äôm inclined to think that ‚ÄòBlack Dog‚Äô is better imagined as a synonym of ‚Äòamorphous dark non-humanoid phantom‚Äô. Having said that, a good number of the tales and accounts really do describe big, black, shaggy-coated dog-like animals, and it‚Äôs those accounts I‚Äôm interested in. Black Dogs are generally large: mostly bigger than a familiar dog like a German shepherd or Labrador, and quite often said to be exceptionally big, some accounts describing them as being as tall as a table or the size of a calf. The eyes are often said to be strikingly large, and to glow, usually red. This is thought to reflect an internally generated, spectral glow and not be a reflection of lights held by the witness. A few accounts pertaining to Devon describe the Black Dog as headless and Black Shuck is said in some stories to only have one, centrally positioned eye. Caption: a Black Dog ‚Äì of the sort recounted in the relevant tales ‚Äì to scale with a person and a mid-size pet dog. Image: Darren Naish. Occasionally, there‚Äôs mention of clanking or swinging chains around the Black Dog‚Äôs neck, or of especially noisy paws that make a clattering, splashing or striking sound on the surface of the road. Baying or shrieking sounds are associated with some Black Dogs. A few accounts describe the animal opening its mouth to reveal a glowing interior, and sometimes glowing fumes or a mist emanates from the mouth too. One or two accounts make mention of a sulferous odour. Caption: at left, McEwan‚Äôs Mystery Animals of Britain and Ireland, a very useful source of Black Dog information. At right: several smaller books discuss or recount various of the local Black Dog legends, and here‚Äôs one of them. The places and the times. Black Dog stories and accounts come from essentially the whole of the British Isles, though there‚Äôs the impression that Suffolk, East Anglia and Lincolnshire in the east, Devon in the west, and Yorkshire in the north-east are where the majority of accounts originate. The eponymous hound of Arthur Conan Doyle‚Äôs 1901-1902 The Hound of the Baskervilles, set on Dartmoor in Devon, was apparently based on the Yeth Hound, a legendary Black Dog local to the area. Caption: The Black Dog Inn in the village of Black Dog, Devon. Image from The Black Dog Inn website. Various places across Britain are named after the Black Dog, including certain roads, lanes, pubs, and the village Black Dog in Devon.

Now imagine what 2024 might be.\nNBC 10 News¬†stated that AAA has reported that the rain and freezing temps in January is already contributing to an earlier start to pothole season.\nAccording to Autoinsurance.com, \"The Northeast has the highest potholes per capita at 24 percent more than the national average.\" Get ready, it seems.\nA good suggestion to be prepared for a damaged tire is to keep a good spare in the car. ¬†This wouldn't help me, however, because I can't change a tire.\nGood luck to us all!\nGallery Credit: Stacker",

        "Question": "How can the presence of a shark on a flooded highway during Hurricane Ian be verified in the video?",
        "Answer": "Based on the verified evidence, the presence of a shark on a flooded highway during Hurricane Ian cannot be definitively confirmed. The video showing a shark swimming in floodwaters may not actually depict a shark, as seen in similar instances where mistaken identifications have occurred during hurricanes [Query 1_evidence_1]. The reference to fin-like objects being mistaken for sharks during Hurricane Nicole further supports the idea that visual misinterpretations can happen during extreme weather events [Query 1_evidence_3].",
