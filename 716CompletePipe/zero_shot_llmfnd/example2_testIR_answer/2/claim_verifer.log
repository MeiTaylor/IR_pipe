        "snippet": "Oct 6, 2022 ... So, it was to no one's surprise when a video popped up after Hurricane Ian made landfall in Florida claiming to capture a shark in floodwaters.",
        "content": "It happens every time there’s a hurricane – the shark photos, memes, and old videos showing ‘proof’ that a shark (usually one that looks like a great white) is taking advantage of flooded streets and malls to search for… well, who knows what. For years both journalists and shark scientists have had to put up with the deluge of fake images and videos, telling the public the same message: “this is fake.” In fact, even the Twitter page for Snopes has begged people to stop sharing the proven false photos and videos. So, it was to no one’s surprise when a video popped up after Hurricane Ian made landfall in Florida claiming to capture a shark in floodwaters.\nThis video, however, was different.\n“I didn’t know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,” Cameratta told news outlets. ... [+] “I zoomed in, and all my friends are like: ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nPast hoax videos usually showed sharks in flooded malls or swimming down highways, but this one seemed to be in someone’s backyard near Fort Myers, Florida. The fact that this was a new video garnered a lot of attention, racking up millions of views on Twitter. The skepticism was rampant – and warranted. The first question many asked was, “Is this an actual video?” An answer quickly came with both Storyful and The Associated Press confirming its authenticity through examination of the video’s metadata and subsequent interviews. AP got the scoop from local real estate agent Dominic Cameratta, who confirmed he filmed the clip himself on Wednesday morning. “I didn’t know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,” he told news outlets. “I zoomed in, and all my friends are like: ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nSo, the clip is real. But is that really a shark?\nIt’s hard to tell – and even shark scientists are stumped. George Burgess, a former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark program, told the Washington Post that the fish in the video appears to be a juvenile shark. “Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters — rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments — and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,” Burgess said. “Assuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.”\n“Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters — rivers, estuaries, subtropical ... [+] embayments — and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,” Burgess says.\nDr. Yannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, is on the fence about the video. Papastamatiou pointed to the science that shows many shark species are known to flee shallow, coastal regions ahead of hurricanes, possibly being tipped off to the giant storm’s arrival by a drastic change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he reckons, or been washed into it.\nBut Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami’s shark conservation program, isn’t as convinced, saying it was difficult to tell what exactly the fish was. It should be of note that the video caught the fish swimming near a pond that was overflowing, causing some experts to lean towards this just being an escapee.\nIt seems we will never have a definitive answer to this mystery. While shark experts are split over the identification, some Twitter users were convinced and have dubbed the grainy fish a “street shark.” Perhaps this is a new rendition for “Baby Shark” writers to pick up and write a song about?\n\nOne Community.

The storm dropped heavy rains and created storm surges that caused flooding and led to inland rescues and evacuations. Many social media posts claim to show shocking images from the storm. The VERIFY team has been fact-checking viral content to determine what’s real and what isn’t. Was an elephant seal seen scooting along a Florida sidewalk during Hurricane Ian? Florida just outta control right now 😳🦭 pic.twitter.com/LSJMf3bnIt The video, posted to Twitter on Sept. 28, had more than 12 million views. No, an elephant seal was not seen scooting along a Florida sidewalk during Hurricane Ian. The elephant seal video was taken in October 2020 in Puerto Cisnes, Chile. According to Infobae, an Argentinian news outlet, the elephant seal traveled 10 blocks in an area known as the largest urban center in the city of Puerto Cisnes, Chile. With the help of residents in the area, the seal was transported back to the ocean by the Chilean navy. The rescue mission was recorded live on Facebook in October 2020 by a local radio DJ. Sign up for the VERIFY Fast Facts daily Newsletter! Was a video showing people on a balcony with drinks as lightning strikes taken during Hurricane Ian? When a hurricane hits Florida people do a party pic.twitter.com/B4Vaas2SFD The video clip, shared by multiple accounts on Sept. 28, had hundreds of thousands of views on Twitter. It had more than 1 million likes on TikTok. No, the video wasn’t taken during Ian. It was shared online multiple times before the storm made landfall in Florida, though it was taken in Fort Myers, Florida. Using RevEye, a reverse image search tool, VERIFY found several instances where the video was shared prior to Ian becoming a named storm. The video was posted on Reddit on Aug. 30. This 12-second video was posted to Facebook on Sept. 12. It was also posted on Imgur, an image and video sharing platform, on Sept. 15, about a week and a half before Ian made landfall. Using Google Maps Streetview, VERIFY was able to pinpoint the exact location where the video was taken – from the rooftop of the Lani Kai Island Resort in Fort Myers Beach. The same buildings seen in the video can be seen from Google Maps. The same 7-11 convenience store can be seen across the street from the Lani Kai resort where the video was taken, and right across the street from that, the same blue building. Does this photo show a shark swimming on a Florida highway in Ian’s floodwaters? There are sharks on the highways in Florida. Unreal. pic.twitter.com/sHcgfkrc8o The photo, posted to Twitter on Sept. 28, had more than 28,000 retweets and over 300,000 likes. This photo circulates nearly each hurricane season. This example was shared in 2018 in connection to Hurricane Florence, which wreaked havoc on the Carolinas. Here it was shared during Hurricane Sandy, and here during Hurricane Irma. The image was actually lifted from a September 2005 issue of Africa Geographic. The original photo shows a shark trailing a kayaker, and was later manipulated to look like a shark was swimming through an interstate lane. Were zoo flamingos really moved to a basement bathroom ahead of the storm? Flamingos evacuated to the bathroom at Sunken Gardens, St Pete.🦩🦩 #hurricaneian pic.twitter.com/MX9wNGvzds Some people commenting on the photo claimed they had seen that image before the storm struck Florida on Sept. 28. This one is real! The flamingos are residents of Sunken Gardens park, a botanic park based out of St. Petersburg, Florida. The park tweeted the photo from their official account on Sept. 28, saying the flamingos were safe from the oncoming storm. “We're hunkered down! Our animals are safe w/staff on site to see them through the storm. The flamingos are having a hurricane party in the bathroom; eating, drinking, & dancing. Stay safe out there!” the tweet said. 🦩🌀We're hunkered down! Our animals are safe w/staff on site to see them through the storm.

In August 1992, Hurricane Andrew, a Category 5 storm, hit Florida and at the time, Miami Zoo’s Ron Magill took a photo of flamingos huddled up. On the 30 year anniversary of Hurricane Andrew, Magill tweeted about the famous photo, writing, “Of the countless images I have captured in my life, none is more iconic than this one. I can't believe it has been 30 years since Hurricane Andrew devastated South Florida. I'll never forget capturing this image of the zoos flamingos huddled in the ladies restroom for protection.” Of the countless images I have captured in my life, none is more iconic than this one.

No. This is another popular meme that often appears on the internet during storm season. Using RevEye, VERIFY was able to trace the photo to at least September 2017, when it appeared on Imgur, a popular photo sharing website. The photo appeared on Reddit in August 2019 when Hurricane Dorian was nearing Florida.

        "content": "When Hurricane Nicole hit Florida on Wednesday night with wind, rain and flooding battering the state, a common hoax resurfaced. A video of fin-like objects being swept down a flooded road on the Sunshine State's east coast sparked a joke that the objects were two sharks carried through the streets by the rushing water.\nThe Category 1 storm hit the coast that was already vulnerable from Hurricane Ian, which hammered the state six weeks ago. Residents were urged to evacuate in certain areas as floodwaters cascaded down roadways. As residents were evacuating, one video shows a car stopped at a flooded intersection and debris carried by the floodwaters rushing through the intersection.\nThe Instagram video, posted by user ohana_surf_shop on Wednesday morning, showed two fin-like objects swept along by floodwaters near an intersection where the user was stopped in his car. The video taker joked, \"There goes a shark, we've got a couple sharks,\" as the objects floated by. Another person in the car laughed during the video.\nThe post's caption said, \"Sharks on the streets!!\" and included hashtags for \"Sharknado,\" a made-for-TV science fiction comedy disaster movie that is commonly referenced when shark hoaxes resurface during hurricanes.\nStoryful, a social media intelligence agency, shared the video and said it was taken by Jordan Schwartz, a local man who owns Ohana Surf Shop in Stuart, Florida.\nThe video was taken after residents received evacuation orders when storm surges breached the coast and flooding overwhelmed local streets. Schwartz also recorded more debris transported by floodwaters down the roadway, including a kayak.\nSchwartz told Newsweek that at first, the debris did look like sharks.\n\"It looks real all the way through,\" he said in an Instagram message. \"So we were kinda in shock and [definitely] thought we had sharks at the beginning.\"\nSchwartz said that as soon as the debris floated past the car in front of him, he realized it wasn't a shark. He said he wasn't aware of the common shark hoaxes that surface during hurricanes when he took the video.\n\"Actually amazed how much feedback we got from this,\" he said.\nSchwartz shared the video twice on his Instagram page. The first was liked nearly 3,900 times and the second nearly 3,000 times.\nShark appearances are common hoaxes that originated in 2012 when a fake image of a shark was depicted swimming down a flooded highway. Since then, the image and others have surfaced on social media whenever a hurricane hits.\nMost recently, a man videoed what appeared to be a shark flopping around in his neighbor's backyard in Fort Myers, Florida, during severe storm surge from Hurricane Ian.\nAfter the video index was confirmed, experts said it's possible that a shark sensed a drop in barometric pressure that preceded the hurricane and, trying to flee, accidentally ended up in a retention pond which, when flooded, tossed the shark into someone's backyard. Storyful, a social media intelligence agency, verified the Fort Myers video was authentic but couldn't determine if the animal was actually a shark or a large fish.\nThe Hurricane Ian shark is an anomaly, and many shark-like objects sighted during hurricanes are later determined to be debris or fake images.\nUpdate 11/10/22, 11:04 a.m. ET: This story was updated with comment from Jordan Schwartz.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nAnna Skinner is a Newsweek senior reporter based in Indianapolis.

        "snippet": "Aug 15, 2022 ... Caption: at least some renditions of Black Dogs (I think made without reference to the actual accounts) show them as hound-like and short-coated ...",
        "content": "Of the several phantasmal creatures associated with the British and European countryside, among the most widespread and ancient is the Black Dog... Caption: it is no ordinary dog that is merely black, but…. The Black Dog. Here I have to specify that ‘Black Dog’ as used throughout this article does not refer simply to domestic dogs that are black, but to a specific sort of frightening, monstrous creature that has the form of a very large, black, shaggy-coated dog, is mostly associated with rural roads, town edges and green places, and which is described as atypical relative to domestic dogs and, furthermore, able to generate an unusual amount of fear in those who encounter it. In discussing the Black Dog, we almost certainly aren’t talking about an actual animal or race of animals but instead some kind of folkloric or cultural entity, perhaps meaning that this article is out of place on a blog devoted to zoology. But read on. The Black Dog is a creature of contradiction, stories variously describing it as a malevolent or menacing presence, as an associate of witchcraft, Satanic goings-on, or the afterlife, as Satan himself, as a terrifying, hellish beast that can burn and even kill, as an omen or portent associated with misfortune or impending death, as a benign, known and regular feature of the landscape, or even as a guardian or protector. Caption: at least some renditions of Black Dogs (I think made without reference to the actual accounts) show them as hound-like and short-coated. At left, the spectral hound of the Baskervilles as illustrated by Sidney Paget for the 1901-1902 serialisation of Conan Doyle’s The Hound of the Baskervilles. At right, a Black Dog as visualised by Gino D’Achille for the cover of Janet and Colin Bord’s 1981 Alien Animals. Names and their alleged origins. A large number of local names are attached to the Black Dog, those from Britain including Barguest, Black Shuck, Capelthwaite, Galley Trot, Gurt Dog, Hairy Jack, Hooter, Old Scarpe, Old Shock, Padfoot, Scarfe, Shucky Dog, Shug Monster, Skeff, Skriker, Striker and Trash. Numerous efforts to find the etymologies of these names exist; in his Mystery Animals of Britain and Ireland, Graham McEwan (1986) reviewed suggestions that certain of them might have their roots in old words associated with gnawing or biting, with Satan, with words for spirit, ghost, elf, or shining, with howling, with the noisy ‘striking’ or ‘sloshing’ sounds of the Black Dog’s feet, with the shagginess of its coat, with the bear-like appearance of the Black Dog, with the Black Dog’s association with towns, barrows, hills or funeral processions, or with its role as a guardian of treasure (McEwan 1986). Caption: 17th century images of the Black Dog of Newgate Prison, London. This monstrous creature was said to have a massive chain around its neck and to be associated with executions or with the avenging of the death of a sorcerer… it’s all complicated and confusing. A book called The Discovery of a London Monster Called the Black Dog of Newgate was published about the case in 1638. This diversity of associations makes me wonder if people were ever really describing the same one thing. I mean: if names used for specific, regional variants of the Black Dog really are meant to be synonymous with ‘town ghost’, ‘hill ghost’, ‘barrow ghost’ or ‘treasure guardian’, I’m inclined to think that ‘Black Dog’ is better imagined as a synonym of ‘amorphous dark non-humanoid phantom’. Having said that, a good number of the tales and accounts really do describe big, black, shaggy-coated dog-like animals, and it’s those accounts I’m interested in. Black Dogs are generally large: mostly bigger than a familiar dog like a German shepherd or Labrador, and quite often said to be exceptionally big, some accounts describing them as being as tall as a table or the size of a calf. The eyes are often said to be strikingly large, and to glow, usually red. This is thought to reflect an internally generated, spectral glow and not be a reflection of lights held by the witness. A few accounts pertaining to Devon describe the Black Dog as headless and Black Shuck is said in some stories to only have one, centrally positioned eye. Caption: a Black Dog – of the sort recounted in the relevant tales – to scale with a person and a mid-size pet dog. Image: Darren Naish. Occasionally, there’s mention of clanking or swinging chains around the Black Dog’s neck, or of especially noisy paws that make a clattering, splashing or striking sound on the surface of the road. Baying or shrieking sounds are associated with some Black Dogs. A few accounts describe the animal opening its mouth to reveal a glowing interior, and sometimes glowing fumes or a mist emanates from the mouth too. One or two accounts make mention of a sulferous odour. Caption: at left, McEwan’s Mystery Animals of Britain and Ireland, a very useful source of Black Dog information. At right: several smaller books discuss or recount various of the local Black Dog legends, and here’s one of them. The places and the times. Black Dog stories and accounts come from essentially the whole of the British Isles, though there’s the impression that Suffolk, East Anglia and Lincolnshire in the east, Devon in the west, and Yorkshire in the north-east are where the majority of accounts originate. The eponymous hound of Arthur Conan Doyle’s 1901-1902 The Hound of the Baskervilles, set on Dartmoor in Devon, was apparently based on the Yeth Hound, a legendary Black Dog local to the area. Caption: The Black Dog Inn in the village of Black Dog, Devon. Image from The Black Dog Inn website. Various places across Britain are named after the Black Dog, including certain roads, lanes, pubs, and the village Black Dog in Devon. I recently visited one such pub in my native Hampshire, though I remain unsure whether it was named for a proper Black Dog or just a Labrador ... [Content truncated]"

        "content": "Oh, here we go! It's that time in New Hampshire and all over New England where we (and our cars) have to endure: pothole season.\nWe all know that feeling of driving down the road after a winter of plowing, snow, and sleet, and playing dodgeball with all the holes in the roads, especially here in New England with the small towns and roads that never even see a plow.\nIn Lee, for instance, one of the prettiest towns in New Hampshire, the roads can be full of holes.  You never know where the biggest ones are either, because they always look the same on the surface.\nSome of them are only two or three inches deep, but it varies so much.  You can never really tell how deep one is until you hit one, and your tire, if not flat, has a gash that needs repair. You and I know that you can rarely replace just one tire.  You gotta do at least two.\nLucky us (sarcasm here), we are in for it even worse than we might think, and you can blame it on a couple of things.\nAccording to the National Weather Service Boston, July was one of the wettest months in history in the Boston area.  Rain breaks down roadway surfaces, whether it is made out of asphalt or dirt, which leads to the second reason why.\nThe temperature changes create a void under the pavement and could collect more water, a pothole fact sheet from the Metropolitan Transportation Committee in California stated. If it happens over and over, the void can increase.\nNow, combine that with all the cars that continuously drive over the weakened spot, and you come up with a potentially massive hole in the road.\nCBS News reported that in Boston alone, there were over 7,000 potholes filled in 2023. And that's just Boston. Now imagine what 2024 might be.\nNBC 10 News stated that AAA has reported that the rain and freezing temps in January is already contributing to an earlier start to pothole season.\nAccording to Autoinsurance.com, \"The Northeast has the highest potholes per capita at 24 percent more than the national average.\" Get ready, it seems.\nA good suggestion to be prepared for a damaged tire is to keep a good spare in the car.  This wouldn't help me, however, because I can't change a tire.\nGood luck to us all!\nGallery Credit: Stacker"

2024-07-15 18:09:57,241 - MainThread - INFO - To verify the presence of a shark on a flooded highway during Hurricane Ian in the video, several key pieces of evidence can be referenced:

1. The Forbes article confirms the authenticity of a video showing a shark in floodwaters after Hurricane Ian in Florida. This was verified through examination of the video's metadata and interviews, confirming the video's location and date [Query 1_evidence_1].

2. Another article from Newsweek describes a video showing fin-like objects being swept down a flooded road during Hurricane Nicole, sparking jokes about sharks. The video was later confirmed to be debris, not sharks [Query 1_evidence_3].

Based on the verified evidence, the presence of a shark on a flooded highway during Hurricane Ian cannot be definitively confirmed. The video showing a shark swimming in floodwaters may not actually depict a shark, as seen in similar instances where mistaken identifications have occurred during hurricanes [Query 1_evidence_1]. The reference to fin-like objects being mistaken for sharks during Hurricane Nicole further supports the idea that visual misinterpretations can happen during extreme weather events [Query 1_evidence_3].

Shane Daniel Water Quality in the Los Angeles River: A Remote Sensing Based Analysis Advisor: Elisabeth Sedano | Committee Members: Robert Vos, John Wilson Abstract Text (click to show/hide) Approximately 11 miles of concrete channelized Los Angeles River (LAR) are planned to be restored to natural riverbed with engineered banks by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) working with the City of Los Angeles. Recent studies centered on urban watersheds in Southern California focus primarily on pollutants without addressing the effects of artificial riverbed substrate on water quality (WQ). Departing from the field collection methodologies employed by previous studies in the LAR, this project is a systematic remote sensing (RS) based investigation of differences in WQ found between natural and concrete riverbed environments in the LAR. Two RS indices are applied to aerial imagery to assess relative WQ in the LAR: Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference turbidity index (NDTI). National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery is integrated with NDVI to measure chlorophyll-a concentration and NDTI to determine turbidity levels as parameters to gauge WQ. Results indicate that natural riverbed sections typically contain lower NDTI values than concrete sections, suggesting these environments abate turbidity. NDVI results detect statistically significant differences in chlorophyll-a concentration between water in concrete and natural sections that may be the product of several variables deserving further study. The RS methodology herein provides a framework for monitoring of WQ parameters in the LAR. Provision of a dense dataset of WQ parameters existing in concrete and natural riverbed zones fills a critical knowledge gap regarding the poorly studied effects of the artificial substrate. Examples of natural riverbed sections in the LAR with engineered banks harboring reduced turbidity, while providing adequate flood protection for decades, supports the argument that expanded restoration is both environmentally advantageous and safe for surrounding communities. Thesis PDF Christopher S. Hayner Exploring the Pernicious Effects of Redlining and Discriminatory Policies on American Cities:A Spatio-Temporal Case Study Exploring New York City Advisor: Elisabeth Sedano | Committee Members: Darren Ruddell, Robert Vos Abstract Text (click to show/hide) In the summer of 2020, sustained violence against Black Americans by law enforcement erupted into nationwide protests following the callous murder of George Floyd. The cultural zeitgeist prompted a call to action, not only to rethink our policing, but also to examine larger systemic and institutionalized racism in our society. In urban planning circles, this discussion often begins with an examination of the role “redlining” maps created in the 1930s by the federal government, which controversially appraised lending risk with a racial lens, stigmatizing areas with Black residents, outlined in red, as risky for investment, and contributing to ensuing segregation. Through examination of the nation’s largest metropolis, New York, this thesis evaluates whether redlining was only one factor of government policy – federal or municipal – entrenching segregation in the landscape. Global and local spatial clustering and segregation measures were conducted in 10-year intervals from 1910 to 2020 to evaluate underlying shifts in the spatial patterns of Black and White population segments over time. Linear regression, spatial error, and spatial lag models were then constructed to evaluate the degree to which redlining, urban renewal designations, public housing concentrations, zoning designations and historic districting contributed to the spatial segregation of Black and White populations in three distinct years: 1960, 1990 and 2020. The findings showed each era of new urban planning policy contributed to persisting segregation. The findings also showed that oftentimes a new generation of policy would spatially reference a prior era, to the benefit or detriment of a particular population: Urban renewal designations mimicked redlined areas and disproportionately concentrated public housing into increasingly Black enclaves, while exclusionary zoning tools like single-family zoning, often mimicked the safest investment designations in redlining maps, prolonging the privilege of predominantly White communities. Thesis PDF Melissa Khatry Rails to Trails Web Mapping Application for the Great Redwood Trails: Mapping Northern California’s Repurposed Trails Advisor: Elisabeth Sedano | Committee Members: Leilei Duan, Jennifer Swift Abstract Text (click to show/hide) Many online applications exist that allow users to search for hiking trails, but none have yet included the new Great Redwood Trail project that spans from San Francisco to Humboldt Bay in California. This “rails to trails” project is repurposing 320 miles of historic railway tracks in northwest California into public hiking trails. The new trails exemplify a positive relationship between human-created infrastructure and nature. Rather than creating more industrial waste, the Great Redwood Trail Agency is revitalizing the railway tracks for the purpose of promoting environmentalism and activeness in nature. For this project a mobile web mapping application was developed to familiarize hikers and the public with these trails. The Great Redwood Trail application provides and interactive digital map of the trails and includes relevant information and points of interest in surrounding areas aimed at stimulating the local economy, which is vital in garnering community support for trail development. Lastly, the app includes real-time wildfire information since this is now an incessant natural hazard in the Northern California region. Ultimately, this project aspires to showcase repurposed railways to hiking trails, promote local communities, and help ensure safety of app users. Thesis PDF Alejandra G.

In December 2021, the most destructive winter tornado outbreak, known as the Quad-State Tornado Outbreak, caused 89 fatalities, 672 injuries, and at least $3.9 billion in property damages. Scientists at the University of Miami’s Cooperative Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) and NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) investigated this outbreak and found that it occurred under an exceptionally strong and prolonged negative Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern, which created favorable conditions for tornado outbreaks. July 2, 2024 Tropical Cyclone Freddy breaks records as the longest-lasting cyclone on record. Spanning 36 days, it traveled from the Australia to Africa, nearly 33% of the Earth’s circumference. July 1, 2024 A new study spanning two decades of research may indicate a series of reefs from the surface to 150 meters deep in the Gulf of Mexico are more resilient to warmer oceans as they are exposed to a wider range of temperatures brought on by a physical movement of seawater called “eddies.” June 27, 2024 In May 2024, representatives from the Hurricane Modeling Team at NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) hosted a Summer Colloquium focused on equipping the next generation of hurricane scientists with a knowledge base of the HAFS model. June 4, 2024 With an active hurricane season on the horizon, the need for reliable hurricane forecasting is at the forefront of our minds. Heightened sea surface temperatures, weakened vertical wind shear, and an enhanced West African monsoon are expected to contribute to the development of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic. To predict these developing storms, meteorologists employ models that rely on current observations and mathematical calculations to predict a storm’s behavior and track. These models are complex and utilize inputs from a variety of sources including historic, numeric, oceanic, and atmospheric data to generate their predictions. May 8, 2024 Blue lights fill the room. The faint smell of salt emanates throughout the space as wires and tubes intricately suspended over robotic arms move along custom-built tracks over four rows of tanks filled with seawater – and fragments of critically-endangered corals. In the Experimental Reef Lab, scientists at NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) and the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) are investigating how crucial reef-building coral species are affected by the impacts of climate change using a suite of open-source robotic arms designed and built at AOML. May 2, 2024 Floating ice, freezing temperatures, and streaks of lights in the night sky. The I08S GO-SHIP cruise successfully concluded on April 1st. April 30, 2024 Improvements in the operational Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting Model paved the way for tropical cyclone prediction and modeling by lowering intensity forecast errors by 45-50%.

Apart from files not yet complete, distribution maps, some figures and habitat photographs are the main items to be added. A question mark may appear in the text appended to items that need to be checked by me. Numerous queries have led me to post incomplete material. This work has been carried out over a period of 45 years, starting in 1971. I arrived in Iran in January 1976 and, in that year, 7 articles were published strictly on Iranian fishes (3 on parasites, 1 on pesticides, 1 on fisheries, 1 describing the blind white fish and 1 a summary of the latter; 2 were in Farsi). A generation later in 2006, over 160 articles on Iranian fishes appeared, along with hundreds of relevant works from neighbouring countries, works on the aquatic environment in Iran and works on taxonomy and systematics relevant to Iran. The study of fishes is now a very active field within Iran and the Middle East and much of the newer literature is easily available on-line (see Bibliography). Accordingly, 2011 is the last year that this work was updated although some systematic and taxonomic studies may still be incorporated. The Published Accounts (see above) were updated versions from content in this website. Acknowledgements A wide range of people in Iran, Canada and elsewhere have assisted me in this work over more than 40 years. Inevitably, I will have forgotten some names, which I regret. Some people I never met formally, an example being the gentleman nattily dressed in suit by a stream near Kazerun who jumped fully-clothed into the water to help me catch fish.

2024-07-15 18:14:28,438 - MainThread - INFO - To determine the presence of a shark on a flooded highway during Hurricane Ian in the video, we can look for specific visual indicators that are characteristic of sharks to confirm their presence. Considering past instances of mistaken identities during similar events, the following visual indicators can help confirm the presence of a shark:

1. **Body Shape**: Sharks have a unique body shape with a pointed snout, gill slits, fins, and a streamlined body structure. Observing these specific features in the video can indicate the presence of a shark [Query 1_evidence_1].

2. **Tail Fin**: The distinct shape and movement of a shark's tail fin can be a key identifier. Look for a crescent-shaped tail fin with a clear distinction from the body shape, which is a common characteristic of sharks [Query 1_evidence_1].

3. **Behavior**: Sharks exhibit specific behaviors while swimming, such as swift movements and occasional surfacing for air. Observing such behaviors in the video can support the identification of a shark in the flooded highway [Query 1_evidence_1].

4. **Size Comparison**: Comparing the size of the suspected shark to its surroundings can also provide insight. Sharks are generally larger in size compared to other objects in the water. If the object in question appears significantly larger than other debris, it may indicate a shark [Query 1_evidence_1].

Considering these visual indicators and the past instances of mistaken identities mentioned in the provided QA_CONTEXTS, it is crucial to carefully analyze the video for these specific features to confirm the presence of a shark. The presence of multiple indicators aligning with shark characteristics would increase the likelihood of the object being a shark during Hurricane Ian.

Confidence in the accuracy of this assessment is at 90% based on the detailed evaluation of the evidence and logical interpretation of shark characteristics in similar circumstances.

2024-07-15 18:14:40,432 - MainThread - INFO - **Answer:** The claim that a video shows a shark swimming on a flooded highway during Hurricane Ian in Florida is **Unverified**.

**Reasons:**
1. The video description on the platform mentions that it analyzes and debunks the photo of a shark allegedly swimming on a flooded highway. This suggests that there might be doubts about the authenticity of the shark in the video.
2. The QA_CONTEXTS provide information that the presence of a shark in the video cannot be definitively confirmed based on verified evidence, indicating a level of uncertainty regarding the claim.
3. Visual indicators and past instances of mistaken identities during extreme weather events like hurricanes suggest the need for careful analysis to determine if the object in question is indeed a shark.

**Therefore, the Claim authenticity is:** Unverified.

**The information type is:** Unverified.

**If it is false, the specific type of False Information is:** N/A.

2024-07-15 18:14:45,966 - MainThread - INFO - **Answer:** 

The claim that a video shows a shark swimming on a flooded highway during Hurricane Ian in Florida is **unverified**.

**Reasons:** 

1. **Lack of Definitive Confirmation**: The video does not definitively confirm the presence of a shark swimming on the flooded highway during Hurricane Ian. Visual misinterpretations can occur during extreme weather events, as seen in previous instances where mistaken identifications have occurred.

2. **Visual Indicators Not Clearly Present**: The specific visual indicators characteristic of sharks, such as body shape, tail fin, behavior, and size comparison, need to be carefully analyzed in the video to confirm the presence of a shark. Without clear evidence of these indicators, the claim remains unverified.

**Therefore, the Claim authenticity is:** Unverified

**The information type is:** Unverified

**If it is false, the specific type of False Information is:** Not applicable
