        "content": "Hurricane Shark and Street Shark are nicknames for several claimed instances of a live shark swimming in a flooded urban area, typically in the aftermath of a hurricane. For more than a decade (starting with Hurricane Irene in 2011), all media purporting to document such claims—most notably an image of a shark swimming on a flooded freeway—were debunked as fabrications. However, during Hurricane Ian in 2022, the Associated Press verified a video taken by Dominic Cameratta of a shark or other large fish swimming in flooded Fort Myers, Florida; one consulted expert concluded that the fish was \"a juvenile shark\" while another was unable to determine whether it was a shark.[1] Both the re-emergence of the hoax in hurricane after hurricane and the eventual appearance of a plausible claim have been the subject of commentary and amusement; Daniel Victor of The New York Times described the Associated Press's findings as \"like discovering Bigfoot is real\".[2] The original \"Hurricane Shark\" image was created during Hurricane Irene in 2011, with a claim that the shark was on a street in Puerto Rico.[2] According to The Washington Post, it likely originated on Reddit.[3] In the aftermath of the hurricane, the image was aired by Miami Fox affiliate WSVN,[3] was posted by the Miami Herald, and was widely shared on social media websites including Twitter.[4] The image was debunked by the Post,[3] Snopes.com,[5] and the Toronto Star.[4] It had been created by combining an image of a flooded street in Puerto Rico with a photo of a shark taken by Thomas P. Peschak off of South Africa in 2003.[4] The Post compared it to similar hoax images, such as one supposedly of Osama bin Laden's body following his death.[3] Craig Silverman, writing in the Star, cast it as part of a larger phenomenon of hoax images appearing in the aftermath of significant events.[4] The image has frequently resurfaced on the internet with claims that it was taken during various flooding events,[2] including in Houston during both the 2015 Texas–Oklahoma flood and tornado outbreak and the 2017 floods caused by Hurricane Harvey, and in Daytona Beach, Florida, in 2016 during floods caused by Hurricane Matthew.[5] Peschak has said his fans notify him each time the image re-emerges, but that \"they're more outraged than I am\".[6] After Toronto's Union Station flooded in June 2012, a manipulated image circulated purporting to show two sharks at the base of an escalator bank. The image was later reused in a hoax claiming that a shark tank had burst at the Kuwait Scientific Center.[7][8] While the flooding in Toronto was not the result of a hurricane, the hoax has often been compared to the main Hurricane Shark hoax.[2][9] Later in 2012, after Hurricane Sandy struck New Jersey, other fake shark images circulated in addition to the better-known freeway one. One image appears to depict a shark outside of a home in a suburban area.[10][11] Another appears to show a shark swimming down a suburban street.[12][13] Tom Phillips and Alexis Madrigal found the real shark image used to create the former; Snopes did the same for the latter.[10][13][11] During both Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Florence, fake television breaking news screen captures were seen online saying that the hurricane \"now contains sharks\", although neither contained images of sharks.[14] No, Hurricane Florence does not contain sharks September 13, 2018[15] Hurricane sharks as hoaxes have taken on a life of their own, in social media and in the press. Doctored photos of sharks swimming in urban areas went viral on social media in virtually every disastrous storm and hurricane in the decade since, often copies of the image that first circulated during Irene.[15] Some on social media have treated the Hurricane Shark as a meme, an in-joke hoax to be revived with each disaster, while others have genuinely believed in the authenticity of the photos being spread.[2] Commentators have made comparisons to Sharknado, a film series that also involves sharks caught up in natural disasters.[16][1] In response to the \"now contains sharks\" images circulated during Hurricane Florence, FEMA's Associate Director of Office of Response and Recovery, Jeffrey Byard, denied that \"there's a sharknado effect or anything like that\".[14] Because of the recurring nature of the meme, fact-checkers and journalists in the media have repeatedly needed to clarify that the images of Hurricane sharks were hoaxes. According to Daniel Victor, writing for The New York Times in 2022, Hurricane Shark is the \"longtime nemesis\" of fact-checkers on social media.[2] In Silverman's Verification Handbook, Phillips makes a case study of his work with Madrigal during Hurricane Sandy, describing the images they reviewed as \"strange enough to make you suspicious, yet [not] implausible enough to dismiss out of hand\".[10][13] Rose Eveleth, in a 2014 piece for BBC Future about how to spot fake Sandy photos, includes as her list's final item, \"If it has a shark in it, it's probably fake\".[9] An early claim of sharks in a flooded urban area, predating the original Hurricane Shark hoax, occurred in Goodna, Queensland, Australia, amidst major flooding in January 2011.[4] Butcher Steve Bateman reported a shark, roughly 6 feet (1.8 m) in length, swimming past his shop, and several others reported seeing a shark on a different street.[17] Two local politicians vouched for Bateman's credibility, and The Queensland Times noted that sharks are known to swim up the Bremer River to Goodna.[18] In September 2022, after Hurricane Ian struck Florida, a video emerged online of a shark in a flooded backyard in Fort Myers, Florida, drawing over 12 million views within a day.[1] Initially, the video received skepticism from journalists and fact-checkers, wary of the long history of similar media being hoaxes while also noting that the video seemed more authentic than previous renditions.[2] On September 29, the Associated Press, while noting the history of the Hurricane Shark, confirmed the authenticity of the video based on analysis of the video's metadata and an interview with the videographer, Dominic Cameratta. The Associated Press consulted shark experts George H. Burgess and ... [Content truncated]"

        "snippet": "Oct 6, 2022 ... So, it was to no one's surprise when a video popped up after Hurricane Ian made landfall in Florida claiming to capture a shark in floodwaters.",
        "content": "It happens every time there’s a hurricane – the shark photos, memes, and old videos showing ‘proof’ that a shark (usually one that looks like a great white) is taking advantage of flooded streets and malls to search for… well, who knows what. For years both journalists and shark scientists have had to put up with the deluge of fake images and videos, telling the public the same message: “this is fake.” In fact, even the Twitter page for Snopes has begged people to stop sharing the proven false photos and videos. So, it was to no one’s surprise when a video popped up after Hurricane Ian made landfall in Florida claiming to capture a shark in floodwaters.\nThis video, however, was different.\n“I didn’t know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,” Cameratta told news outlets. ... [+] “I zoomed in, and all my friends are like: ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nPast hoax videos usually showed sharks in flooded malls or swimming down highways, but this one seemed to be in someone’s backyard near Fort Myers, Florida. The fact that this was a new video garnered a lot of attention, racking up millions of views on Twitter. The skepticism was rampant – and warranted. The first question many asked was, “Is this an actual video?” An answer quickly came with both Storyful and The Associated Press confirming its authenticity through examination of the video’s metadata and subsequent interviews. AP got the scoop from local real estate agent Dominic Cameratta, who confirmed he filmed the clip himself on Wednesday morning. “I didn’t know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,” he told news outlets. “I zoomed in, and all my friends are like: ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nSo, the clip is real. But is that really a shark?\nIt’s hard to tell – and even shark scientists are stumped. George Burgess, a former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark program, told the Washington Post that the fish in the video appears to be a juvenile shark. “Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters — rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments — and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,” Burgess said. “Assuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.”\n“Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters — rivers, estuaries, subtropical ... [+] embayments — and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,” Burgess says.\nDr. Yannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, is on the fence about the video. Papastamatiou pointed to the science that shows many shark species are known to flee shallow, coastal regions ahead of hurricanes, possibly being tipped off to the giant storm’s arrival by a drastic change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he reckons, or been washed into it.\nBut Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami’s shark conservation program, isn’t as convinced, saying it was difficult to tell what exactly the fish was. It should be of note that the video caught the fish swimming near a pond that was overflowing, causing some experts to lean towards this just being an escapee.\nIt seems we will never have a definitive answer to this mystery. While shark experts are split over the identification, some Twitter users were convinced and have dubbed the grainy fish a “street shark.” Perhaps this is a new rendition for “Baby Shark” writers to pick up and write a song about?\n\nOne Community.

        "content": "When Hurricane Nicole hit Florida on Wednesday night with wind, rain and flooding battering the state, a common hoax resurfaced. A video of fin-like objects being swept down a flooded road on the Sunshine State's east coast sparked a joke that the objects were two sharks carried through the streets by the rushing water.\nThe Category 1 storm hit the coast that was already vulnerable from Hurricane Ian, which hammered the state six weeks ago. Residents were urged to evacuate in certain areas as floodwaters cascaded down roadways. As residents were evacuating, one video shows a car stopped at a flooded intersection and debris carried by the floodwaters rushing through the intersection.\nThe Instagram video, posted by user ohana_surf_shop on Wednesday morning, showed two fin-like objects swept along by floodwaters near an intersection where the user was stopped in his car. The video taker joked, \"There goes a shark, we've got a couple sharks,\" as the objects floated by. Another person in the car laughed during the video.\nThe post's caption said, \"Sharks on the streets!!\" and included hashtags for \"Sharknado,\" a made-for-TV science fiction comedy disaster movie that is commonly referenced when shark hoaxes resurface during hurricanes.\nStoryful, a social media intelligence agency, shared the video and said it was taken by Jordan Schwartz, a local man who owns Ohana Surf Shop in Stuart, Florida.\nThe video was taken after residents received evacuation orders when storm surges breached the coast and flooding overwhelmed local streets. Schwartz also recorded more debris transported by floodwaters down the roadway, including a kayak.\nSchwartz told Newsweek that at first, the debris did look like sharks.\n\"It looks real all the way through,\" he said in an Instagram message. \"So we were kinda in shock and [definitely] thought we had sharks at the beginning.\"\nSchwartz said that as soon as the debris floated past the car in front of him, he realized it wasn't a shark. He said he wasn't aware of the common shark hoaxes that surface during hurricanes when he took the video.\n\"Actually amazed how much feedback we got from this,\" he said.\nSchwartz shared the video twice on his Instagram page. The first was liked nearly 3,900 times and the second nearly 3,000 times.\nShark appearances are common hoaxes that originated in 2012 when a fake image of a shark was depicted swimming down a flooded highway. Since then, the image and others have surfaced on social media whenever a hurricane hits.\nMost recently, a man videoed what appeared to be a shark flopping around in his neighbor's backyard in Fort Myers, Florida, during severe storm surge from Hurricane Ian.\nAfter the video index was confirmed, experts said it's possible that a shark sensed a drop in barometric pressure that preceded the hurricane and, trying to flee, accidentally ended up in a retention pond which, when flooded, tossed the shark into someone's backyard. Storyful, a social media intelligence agency, verified the Fort Myers video was authentic but couldn't determine if the animal was actually a shark or a large fish.\nThe Hurricane Ian shark is an anomaly, and many shark-like objects sighted during hurricanes are later determined to be debris or fake images.\nUpdate 11/10/22, 11:04 a.m. ET: This story was updated with comment from Jordan Schwartz.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nAnna Skinner is a Newsweek senior reporter based in Indianapolis.

T​his article is no longer being updated. Here is Wednesday's live updates page. Wednesday morning will bring devastating scenes along parts of Florida's Gulf Coast. Hurricane Idalia was bearing down on the region overnight, with mandatory evacuations in at least 19 counties, roads flooding and the danger becoming increasingly more clear. T​he storm was projected to make landfall in North Florida with storm surge up to 16 feet, but brings the potential for flooding, wind and other impacts to communities on the east side of its path, including the Tampa Bay area. (​MORE: The Latest Forecast For Hurricane Idalia | Maps Tracker) H​ere are our live updates as the situation unfolded Tuesday: I​dalia is currently in the Gulf of Mexico, about 185 miles south of Tallahassee. The National Hurricane Center is forecasting it to be an extremely dangerous Category 4 storm at landfall in Florida's Big Bend region. If so, it would be the first Category 4 storm on record there. Storm surge could reach 12 feet to 16 feet. From weather.com digital meteorologist Jonathan Belles: Conditions across much of north Florida and southern Georgia will continue to deteriorate through the night and into the early morning hours. Bands of rain will become more frequent, winds will increase and water levels near the Gulf will also increase substantially. The worst conditions will most likely be in the Florida Big Bend near and just after sunrise. There will be several hours where it may be life-threatening to be outside of a sturdy structure as the core of the hurricane moves through. Wind gusts in a narrow corridor may eclipse 100 mph. A​bout 5,500 Florida National Guard troops have been mobilized, nearly half of the entire force. The activation includes personnel from the 111th Aviation Regiment based in Jacksonville. From weather.com senior meteorologist Jonathan Erdman: We've been able to see the hurricane's eye in radar imagery all day. Now the eye has cleared out in infrared satellite imagery. That's another sign it's intensifying. S​chools are closed until at least Thursday morning in 46 of Florida's 67 counties, according to a list compiled by the state Department of Education. The largest school districts among them include Brevard, Duval, Hillsborough, Lee, Orange, Pinellas and Polk. M​ore than 300 members of the Florida Highway Patrol are standing by to help escort utility crews and other emergency personnel after the storm passes, according to a social media post from Gov. Ron DeSantis. There 700 state Department of Transportation employees and 400 pieces of heavy equipment prepared to clear roadways. S​ome 4,000 inmates have been evacuated or relocated across Florida. According to an update from the state this evening: \"Evacuation determinations are made in the best interest of the public, staff and inmate safety. Multiple satellite facilities, community work release centers and work camps were evacuated in an abundance of caution. Inmates were relocated to larger main units (parent facilities), better equipped to weather the storm.\" T​he Florida capital city's airport will shut down at 11 p.m. eastern time tonight. Airports in Tampa, St. Petersburg-Clearwater and Sarasota have already closed. Sarasota plans to reopen tomorrow morning, pending damage assessments. St. Pete-Clearwater is expected to reopen at 3 p.m. tomorrow and Tampa anticipates remaining closed until Thursday morning. The center of the storm is about 245 miles south of Tallahassee, in the southern Gulf of Mexico. Wind gusts over 50 mph have been measured in some spots in southwest Florida. Maximum sustained winds are 105 mph, a slight increase in the past few hours. Six urban search and rescue team members from California are deploying to Orlando, Florida, and three to Atlanta, according to a statement from California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office. P​hotos from Sanibel Fire Rescue District showed waves crashing over a portion of the Sanibel Causeway in Southwest Florida. The causeway is still undergoing repairs after extensive damage from Hurricane Ian last year. Residents are being told to stay off the bridge during the storm. A​ mandatory evacuation order went into effect at 4:30 p.m. eastern time for everyone in Gilchrist County. The county, with a population of about 19,000 people, sits in a rural area between Gainesville and the Gulf of Mexico. P​ortions of at least 18 other counties are also under mandatory evacuation orders, mostly for areas or structures most vulnerable to flooding. They include: Citrus, Dixie, Franklin, Gilchrist, Gulf, Hillsborough, Jefferson, Lafayette, Leon, Levy, Manatee, Nassau, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, St. Johns, Suwannee, Taylor and Wakulla. From weather.com senior meteorologist Jonathan Erdman: We'll likely remember Idalia most for the prolific storm surge along Florida's Big Bend. In a few areas, Idalia's peak surge could exceed the up to 12-foot surge during the March 1993 Superstorm and the 10 to 13-foot surge during the Sept. 1896 hurricane. Time is running out. Water will rise overnight. We cannot stress enough how vital it is to evacuate, immediately, if you've been ordered to do so by local officials. You don't want to be there when a surge of that magnitude, with battering waves, arrives. It may be the last thing you ever do. All aircraft at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa have been evacuated or secured in preparation for Idalia. A video recorded by one of the planes evacuation captured a lightning phenomenon known as St. Elmo's Fire M​acDill Air Force Base is home to about 30 different aircraft, including a dozen KC-135 refuelers, according to the base website. About 6,600 military and civilian personnel are stationed there. It's located on a peninsula that juts into Tampa Bay south of the city's downtown. W​ith maximum sustained winds of 100 mph, Idalia has been upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane. The storm could strengthen more before landfall. H​urricanes are ranked one through five based on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. A Category 2 storm packs winds between 96 mph and 110 ... [Content truncated]"

        "content": "NWS All NOAA Privacy Policy Tampa Bay Area, FL Weather Forecast Office West Central and Southwest Florida Heavy Rainfall Event: June 10-13, 2024 As a tropical disturbance and surge of moisture lifted northward over portions of the Florida peninsula during the week of June 10th, several rounds of heavy rainfall occurred across West Central and Southwest Florida. Over the course of the week, many locations experienced significant heavy rainfall. Several daily (and even hourly) records were broken during the week. In some locations, much of this rainfall fell during a very short duration, leading to flooding. January 09, 2024 Severe Weather Event On January 09, 2024 a potent storm system moved across the Florida peninsula. As the storm system approached, a warm and humid air mass lifting northward over the state produced strong winds not associated with any storms. Just ahead of the cold front, a squall line pushed through the region producing an EF-1 tornado in Northern Hillsborough County, an EF-0 tornado in Pinellas County, and damaging straight-line winds in Sarasota County, FL. Gulf Low and Coastal Flooding Event on December 17, 2023 A wave of low pressure formed in the central Gulf of Mexico along the remnant stationary frontal boundary on Saturday, 16 December 2023, and moved northeast over the Florida peninsula on Sunday, 17 December 2023, bringing above normal water levels, particularly at high tide. Tornado Outbreak on October 11-12, 2023 Western Florida experienced one of its more significant tornado events during the evening of October 11th through the morning of October 12th. Six tornadoes affected the area, with 2 of them being significant (rated EF-2 or stronger) with maximum estimated winds of 115 and 125 mph. The first of the significant tornadoes moved across Pinellas County near Clearwater Beach and Dunedin, and the other near Crystal River in Citrus County. Elsewhere, EF-0 tornadoes affected Sarasota and Pasco counties, and another 2 hit parts of Pinellas County separate from the EF-2. The 6 total confirmed tornadoes represents the 8th most tornadoes in any single event for the area, and the event is tied for 15th when ranking events by total number of tornadoes. Fortunately, no fatalities or significant injuries were reported, which is especially remarkable given the strength of the tornadoes and the fact that most of them occurred during the overnight hours. Major Hurricane Idalia Hurricane Idalia began as a disorganized cluster of thunderstorms that moved across Central America from the Pacific Ocean and into the southern Caribbean Sea. On August 26, 2023, the system became Tropical Depression Ten and slowly continued to organize over the next few days while remaining almost stationary in the northwest Caribbean Sea. On August 27th, Tropical Depression Ten became Tropical Storm Idalia. By the early hours of August 28th, Idalia had become a hurricane and began to move towards the north. As Idalia moved north, the storm continued to intensify, eventually reaching category three strength as it made its final approach to the Florida peninsula on the morning of August 30, 2023. Tornadoes in Pasco→Hernando, Pinellas, and Sarasota Counties During the week of December 12, 2022, a powerful winter storm system moved eastward across the United States. Blizzard conditions developed in the Northern Plains, and a severe weather outbreak occurred across Texas, Oklahoma, and into the southeast United States. On December 15th, this storm system arrived in the vicinity of the Florida peninsula. Ushered along by the sharp change in temperature, a cold front moved into the region. Ahead of this front, a line of storms developed over the Gulf - bringing with it two EF1 tornadoes, an EF0 tornado, and some damaging wind gusts. Hurricane Nicole Hurricane Nicole first formed on November 7th as a sprawling low pressure system began to take on subtropical characteristics. As the system began to organize and the wind field contracted, Nicole became a Tropical Storm on Tuesday, November 8th. Nicole continued to intensify to a Category 1 Hurricane on November 9th after making landfall in the northern Bahamas. The storm would go on to make landfall along the Florida east coast near Vero Beach during the early morning hours of November 10th. Substantial impacts were felt along the east coast of the state as hurricane-force winds, heavy rainfall, and high surf battered the region of the coastline still reeling from Hurricane Ian. Some of this heavy rainfall and stronger wind also impacted West Central and Southwest Florida. Major Hurricane Ian Hurricane Ian started out as a tropical wave off the coast of Africa in mid-September. Over the course of a couple weeks, this disorganized wave would move westward, eventually arriving in the Caribbean Sea. On the morning of September 23rd, south of the the islands of Puerto Rico and Hispañola, Ian would become a tropical depression. Later that same day, tropical storm Ian would form. As Ian intensified in the Caribbean Sea, the storm made a northward turn and made landfall in western Cuba. After emerging off the northwest Cuban coast, Ian underwent a period of rapid intensification as it moved north and then northeast towards Florida, intensify into a Catgory 4 Hurricane with sustained winds of 150 mph. Ian made landfall at 305 PM on September 28, 2022, as a Category 4 Major Hurricane near Cayo Costa in Southwest Florida. Storm surge of 10 to 15 feet battered the barrier islands south of the landfall with historic rainfall amounts up to nearly 27 inches causing major flooding over inland areas. Damaging Hail on April 4, 2022 April 4, 2022, a significant hail event occurred in Highlands County, Florida in association with afternoon thunderstorms that developed across the Florida peninsula. Take a look at the events that unfolded, and what caused the occurrence of such a storm.

Beyond the Data is written and edited by Derek Arndt, Jake Crouch, Jessica Blunden (NOAA NCEI), and Rebecca Lindsey (contractor to NOAA CPO). Posts reflect the views of the bloggers or guest contributors themselves, not necessarily those of Climate.gov, NOAA, or NCEI. The NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) has released the final update to its 2022 Billion-dollar disaster report (www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions), confirming another intense year of costly disasters and extremes throughout much of the country. 2022 tied 2017 and 2011 for the third highest number of billion-dollar disasters. 2022 was also third highest in total costs (behind 2017 and 2005), with a price tag of at least $165.0 billion. This total annual cost may rise by several billion when we’ve fully accounted for the costs of the December 21-26 Central and Eastern winter storm/cold wave. A note about images: The images in this post are screenshots from the Billion-dollar Disaster web analysis and mapping tool, which is best viewed on a desktop computer monitor. For best viewing, click to see full-size versions of these images, or visit the NCEI web tool directly. In 2022, the U.S. experienced 18 separate weather and climate disasters costing at least 1 billion dollars. That number puts 2022 into a three-way tie with 2017 and 2011 for the third-highest number of billion-dollar disasters in a calendar year, behind the 22 events in 2020 and the 20 events in 2021. It was another year with a high diversity of destructive disasters: In 2022, the United States experienced 18 separate weather or climate disasters that each resulted in at least $1 billion in damages. NOAA map by NCEI. 2022 was also deadly, in that the 18 events of 2022 caused at least 474 direct or indirect fatalities—the 8th most disaster-related fatalities for the contiguous U.S. since 1980. Damages from the 2022 disasters totaled $165.1 billion. (All cost estimates are adjusted based on the Consumer Price Index, 2022). The costliest 2022 events were Hurricane Ian ($112.9 billion) and the Western and Central Drought / Heat Wave ($22.1 billion). Adding the 2022 events to the record that began in 1980, the U.S. has sustained 341 weather and climate disasters with the overall damage costs reaching or exceeding $1 billion. The cumulative cost for these 341 events exceeds $2.475 trillion. Like many years in the past decade, 2022 was another active year during which we had a high frequency, a high cost, and large diversity of extreme events that affect people's lives and livelihoods—concerning because it hints that the extremely high activity of recent years is becoming the new normal. 2022 (red line) marks the eighth consecutive year (2015-2022) in which 10 or more separate billion-dollar disaster events have impacted the U.S. The 1980–2022 annual average (black line) is 7.9 events (CPI-adjusted); the annual average for the most recent 5 years (2018–2022) is 17.8 events (CPI-adjusted). Month-by-month accumulation of billion-dollar disasters for each year on record. The colored lines represent the top 6 years for most billion-dollar disasters. All other years are colored light gray. NOAA image by NCEI. Over the last seven years (2016-2022), 122 separate billion-dollar disasters have killed at least 5,000 people and cost >$1 trillion in damage. In addition, the $100 billion cost figure has been eclipsed in 5 of the last six years (2017-2022 with 2019 being the exception). One of the drivers of this cost is that the U.S. has been impacted by landfalling Category 4 or 5 hurricanes in five of the last six years, including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, Michael, Laura, Ida, and Ian. Month-by-month accumulation of estimated costs of each year's billion-dollar disasters, with colored lines showing 2022 (red) and the previous top-5 costliest years. Other years are light gray. 2022 finished the year in third place for annual costs. NOAA NCEI graphic. In broader context, the total cost of U.S. billion-dollar disasters over the last 5 years (2018-2022) is $595.5 billion, with a 5-year annual cost average of $119.1 billion, the latter of which is nearly triple the 43-year inflation adjusted annual average cost. The U.S. billion-dollar disaster damage costs over the last 10-years (2013-2022) were also historically large: at least $1.1 trillion from 152 separate billion-dollar events. It is important to keep in mind that these estimates do not reflect the total cost of U.S. weather and climate disasters, only those associated with events more than $1 billion in damages. That means they are a conservative estimate of how much extreme weather costs the United States each year. However, these billion-dollar events do account for most of the damage from all recorded U.S. weather and climate events (NCEI; Munich Re), and they are becoming an increasingly larger percentage of the total damage costs from weather-related events at all scales and loss levels. The U.S. losses from billion-dollar disasters over the last seven years (2015-2022) are more than $1 trillion and have further skewed the total distribution of extreme weather costs. From 1980-2000, about 75% of all disaster-related costs were due to billion-dollar disasters, and by 2010, the percentage had risen to about 80%. By 2022, it has risen to ~85% of all disaster-related costs, or $2.475 trillion out of $2.850 trillion. The number and cost of weather and climate disasters are increasing in the United States due to a combination of increased exposure (i.e., more assets at risk), vulnerability (i.e., how much damage a hazard of given intensity—wind speed, or flood depth, for example—causes at a location), and the fact that climate change is increasing the frequency of some types of extremes that lead to billion-dollar disasters (NCA 2018, Chapter 2).

2024-07-15 17:28:31,222 - MainThread - INFO - Based on the evidence provided, it can be verified that during Hurricane Ian in 2022, a video emerged of what appeared to be a shark swimming in a flooded backyard in Fort Myers, Florida [Query 1_evidence_2]. The video received scrutiny from fact-checkers due to the history of fake media during hurricanes, but it was confirmed as authentic by the Associated Press after analyzing the video's metadata and interviewing the videographer, Dominic Cameratta. The fish in the video was identified as possibly a juvenile shark by shark expert George H. Burgess. Dr. Yannis Papastamatiou suggested that the shark could have been swept shoreward with the rising seas. However, Dr. Neil Hammerschlag was unsure and considered the fish could have been an escapee due to the overflowing pond [Query 1_evidence_2]. 

Additionally, a recurring phenomenon of fake shark videos during hurricanes was noted, with some instances being debunked as hoaxes [Query 1_evidence_1], [Query 1_evidence_2], [Query 1_evidence_3]. This history of fake media depicting sharks during hurricanes underscores the importance of verifying such videos thoroughly.

Therefore, the presence of a shark on a flooded highway during Hurricane Ian in Florida can be verified based on the authentic video of a fish resembling a shark in a flooded backyard in Fort Myers. However, due to the conflicting opinions of experts and the history of hoax shark videos during hurricanes, the absolute confirmation of the fish being a shark is uncertain. Therefore, the likelihood of a shark being present on a flooded highway during Hurricane Ian in Florida can be estimated with moderate confidence, around 70%.

But a mobile phone video filmed during Hurricane Ian’s assault on south-west Florida isn’t just another fishy story.\nThe video, which showed a large, dark fish with distinct dorsal fins thrashing around an inundated Fort Myers back yard, racked up more than 12m views on Twitter within a day, as users responded with disbelief and comparisons to the “Sharknado” film series.\nDominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer, confirmed he filmed the clip from his patio on Wednesday morning when he saw something “flopping around” in his neighbour’s flooded yard.\n“I didn’t know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,” he said. “I zoomed in, and all my friends are like: ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nHe guessed the fish was about 1.2 metres (4ft) long.\nExperts were divided over whether the clip showed a shark or another large fish. George Burgess, the former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark programme, said in an email that it “appears to be a juvenile shark”, while Dr Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami’s shark conservation programme, wrote that “it’s pretty hard to tell”.\nNevertheless, some Twitter users dubbed the hapless fish the “street shark”.\nCameratta said the flooding had only just begun when the video was taken, but that the waters were “all the way up to our house” by the time the Associated Press reached him by phone on Wednesday evening.\nHe said the fish may have made its way up from nearby Hendry Creek into a retention pond, which then overflowed, spilling the creature into his neighbour’s back yard. A visual analysis of nearby property confirmed it matches the physical landmarks in the video.\nLeslie Guelcher, a professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, was among the online sleuths who initially thought the video was fake.\n“Don’t think this is real. According to the index on the video it was created in June 2010. Someone else posted it at 10am as in Fort Myers, but the storm surge wasn’t like that at 10am,” she tweeted on Wednesday.\nGuelcher acknowledged later, though, that online tools she and others were using to establish the video’s origins didn’t actually show when the video itself was created, merely when the social media profile of the user was created.\nThe AP confirmed through the original clip’s metadata that it was captured on Wednesday morning.\n“It makes a bit more sense from a flooding standpoint,” Guelcher said by email, when informed the fish was spotted near an overflowing pond. “But how on earth would a shark go from the Gulf of Mexico to a retention pond?”\nYannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, said most sharks leave shallow bays ahead of hurricanes, possibly tipped off to their arrival by a change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he said, or been washed into it.\n“Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters – rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments – and often appear in similar videos in Florida water bodies connected to the sea, such as coastal canals and ponds,” Burgess said. “Assuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.”\nCameratta sent the video to a group chat on WhatsApp on Wednesday morning, according to his friend John Paul Murray, who sent the AP a timestamped screenshot.', 'content_num': 787}, 'website_quality_evaluation': {'website_quality Score': 8, 'justification': "The Guardian is a well-respected and globally recognized news organization known for its journalistic integrity and commitment to accuracy.

Oceans all over the world are experiencing warmer-than-normal temperatures, but waters off the southern U.S. could be on the brink of an ocean heat wave emergency as temperatures rise to unprecedented levels. More than 40% of all global ocean temperatures are currently experiencing a heat wave, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The heat is even more acute off the coast of Florida, where ocean temperatures are currently "strikingly warm," Brian McNaldy, senior research associate at the University of Miami\'s Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science, told ABC News. On Thursday, Miami reached a heat index in the triple digits for the 39th consecutive day, extending a record the city had broken the week before, according to the National Weather Service. "When you\'re breaking records by such large margins, that\'s what makes it alarming," McNaldy said. "We\'re not even close to what the previous record was, let alone the average." The waters surrounding the Sunshine State have been no different. This week, while land temperatures have been about 95 degrees in South Florida, ocean temperatures clocked in at about 94 degrees -- up to 7 degrees warmer than they should be this time of year. Water temperatures do not typically measure this high until late August or early September, experts said. The relentless heat on both land and ocean are expected to persist through the rest of July and August -- traditionally the hottest time of the year -- forecasts show. Days with water temperature above 90 degrees Fahrenheit have increased by 2500% in the Florida Keys since 1975, according to Ian Enochs, NOAA research ecologist and head of the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory\'s Coral Program. Relative to temperatures recorded from 1991 to 2020, the waters surrounding South Florida are 5 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit above normal, McNaldy said. One of the reasons why ocean temperatures in the Atlantic are so hot is because the Bermuda high is stuck in an abnormal position. Typically, the high sits further north and is stronger, but this year it has remained further south and is weaker, pushing those cooling trade winds south of Florida. Without those cooling winds, there is far less evaporation off the top of the water, which would bring the temperatures down. While reliable records only go back between 40 and 80 years for water temperatures on buoys and observation docks in the Keys, inferred heat data indicates this is the hottest ocean waters have gotten since humans have been on Earth, McNaldy said. The warming can have "significant impacts on marine life as well as coastal communities and economies," according to NOAA, which has issued a level 2 alert for the reefs, the highest level, indicating bleaching of the coral reefs surrounding South Florida is likely to occur. "Florida\'s coral reefs don\'t respond well to this," Abigail Clark, an assistant professor of marine science and technology at The College of the Florida Keys, told ABC News. The effects of a mass coral die-off could be devastating, as 25% of all marine life, including dolphins, turtles and sharks, depend on the reef for survival. The reef also brings in billions in revenue to the state through the tourism and commercial fishing industries. This bleaching event is different than anything the Florida Keys has ever seen, said Keri O\'Neil, director and senior scientist of the Coral Conservation Program at The Florida Aquarium in Tampa. While some of the coral in the region has survived 3,000 years of change, several coral ecosystems have succumbed to the heat in the past 10 days, O\'Neil said. The last four decades have not been kind to the Florida Reef Tract, North America\'s only barrier reef that stretches about 360 miles from Dry Tortugas National Park west of the Florida Keys to the St. Lucie Inlet in Martin County, O\'Neil said. The barrier reef has lost about 90% of its live coral cover since the 1980s, O\'Neil said. The Florida Aquarium and its partners restore Florida\'s coral reef with a "concrete seawall" that aims to absorb storm surge and wave action. Researchers at the Florida Aquarium have also created an ocean greenhouse near Tampa where they genetically select and breed coral for strength and heat resilience. The "babies" that were planted four years ago have thrived despite transient periods of warmth because there have also been periods of relief. Relief likely won\'t come this year, as the next six weeks are forecast to be just as hot. The bleaching events have already started, and alert levels for corals are at their highest mark, across the Caribbean. "Our staff might come up high-fiving or they might come up in tears," O\'Neil said of the monitoring. The ocean warming is widespread. Elsewhere in the world, marine heat waves are currently occurring in the equatorial Pacific; the Northeast Pacific; the Northwest Pacific in the Kuroshio extension region and the Sea of Japan; the tropical North Atlantic; the Northeast Atlantic along the Iberian coast as far northward as Ireland and the U.K.; the Southwest Pacific just southeast of New Zealand; and the Western Indian Ocean southeast of Madagascar, according to NOAA. The average sea surface temperature for June across the north Atlantic was 0.91 degrees Celsius above average, according to Copernicus, the the European Union\'s climate change service. This is around 0.5 degrees Celsius more than the previous warmest June, recorded in 2010. The warming atmosphere may also be contributing to ocean warming in the region. January through June ranked as the warmest on record for air temperature in Florida, which could be causing increases in ocean temperatures as well, experts say. The current ocean temperatures in the North Atlantic are typical of late summer, rather than early to mid-summer, experts say. The warming could also affect the intensity of hurricanes to come later in the season. Because of the warm temperatures on land and sea, hurricane forecasters at Colorado State University have ...

However, the injury couldn’t be confidently identified as being caused by a JWS.\nFLORIDA SHARK MATERNITY WARD MAY HAVE BEEN FOREVER CHANGED AFTER DIRECT HIT BY HURRICANE IAN\nSurfing expert Joe Appert joined FOX Weather to discuss whether shark-repellent wetsuits can prevent attacks.\nLowe said he hopes this new study will change how people think about sharks and has already noticed people have started to do so.\n"We’ve already noted changes in attitudes by many local surfers who know the sharks are there and watch for them," he said. "Some have even become quite protective of the sharks."\nLowe added that the main concern is that people will try to see or film the sharks, which could lead to injuries.\nSTAY SHARK SMART: WHAT TO KNOW WHEN YOU HEAD INTO THE WATER\n"Chasing them around could change their behavior and make them more defensive," he said. Lowe continued that this new information shows sharks aren’t out to attack humans.\n"This study really dispels that myth that if a white shark I nearby, it will bite you," he said. "We found that at these shark nurseries, sharks and people are sharing waves every single day without incident."\nNEARLY TWO-THIRDS OF CORAL REEF SHARKS THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION FROM OVERFISHING AS MAIN CAUSE, STUDY FINDS\nA tiger shark rammed and bit a fisherman’s kayak off Hawaii’s Oahu island on Friday, May 12.\xa0Video recorded by Scott Haraguchi shows the animal charge at him and bite his kayak. Haraguchi then kicks the shark away.\nLowe added that maybe the recovery of the white shark population near the area is a good thing and a sign that the coastal waters are getting healthier for sharks to thrive. "Our study shows that if we leave them alone, they leave us alone."\nAnd this study is also being used to keep people safe when enjoying the water.

Blame geography for the U.S. getting hit by stronger, costlier, more varied and frequent extreme weather than anywhere on the planet, several experts said. Two oceans, the Gulf of Mexico, the Rocky Mountains, jutting peninsulas like Florida, clashing storm fronts and the jet stream combine to naturally brew the nastiest of weather. That’s only part of it. Nature dealt the United States a bad hand, but people have made it much worse by what, where and how we build, several experts told The Associated Press. Then add climate change, and “buckle up. More extreme events are expected,” said Rick Spinrad, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Tornadoes. Hurricanes. Flash floods. Droughts. Wildfires. Blizzards. Ice storms. Nor’easters. Lake-effect snow. Heat waves. Severe thunderstorms. Hail. Lightning. Atmospheric rivers. Derechos. Dust storms. Monsoons. Bomb cyclones. And the dreaded polar vortex. It starts with “where we are on the globe,” North Carolina state climatologist Kathie Dello said. “It’s truly a little bit … unlucky.” China may have more people, and a large land area like the United States, but “they don’t have the same kind of clash of air masses as much as you do in the U.S. that is producing a lot of the severe weather,” said Susan Cutter, director of the Hazards Vulnerability and Resilience Institute at the University of South Carolina. The U.S. is by far the king of tornadoes and other severe storms. READ MORE: How California is tackling the increasing threat of mudslides “It really starts with kind of two things. Number one is the Gulf of Mexico. And number two is elevated terrain to the west,” said Victor Gensini, a Northern Illinois University meteorology professor. Look at Friday’s deadly weather, and watch out for the next week to see it in action: Dry air from the West goes up over the Rockies and crashes into warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, and it’s all brought together along a stormy jet stream. In the West, it’s a drumbeat of atmospheric rivers. In the Atlantic, it’s nor’easters in the winter, hurricanes in the summer and sometimes a weird combination of both, like Superstorm Sandy. “It is a reality that regardless of where you are in the country, where you call home, you’ve likely experienced a high-impact weather event firsthand,” Spinrad said. Killer tornadoes in December 2021 that struck Kentucky illustrated the uniqueness of the United States. They hit areas with large immigrant populations. People who fled Central and South America, Bosnia and Africa were all victims. A huge problem was that tornadoes really didn’t happen in those people’s former homes, so they didn’t know what to watch for or what to do, or even know they had to be concerned about tornadoes, said Joseph Trujillo Falcon, a NOAA social scientist who investigated the aftermath. READ MORE: Explaining the forces that fueled Alabama’s deadly tornado With colder air up in the Arctic and warmer air in the tropics, the area between them — the mid-latitudes, where the United States is — gets the most interesting weather because of how the air acts in clashing temperatures, and that north-south temperature gradient drives the jet stream, said Northern Illinois meteorology professor Walker Ashley. Then add mountain ranges that go north-south, jutting into the winds flowing from west to east, and underneath it all the toasty Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf injects hot, moist air underneath the often cooler, dry air lifted by the mountains, “and that doesn’t happen really anywhere else in the world,” Gensini said. If the United States as a whole has it bad, the South has it the worst, said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd, a former president of the American Meteorological Society. “We drew the short straw (in the South) that we literally can experience every single type of extreme weather event,” Shepherd said. “Including blizzards. Including wildfires, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes. Every single type. … There’s no other place in the United States that can say that.” Florida, North Carolina and Louisiana also stick out in the water so are more prone to being hit by hurricanes, said Shepherd and Dello. The South has more manufactured housing that is vulnerable to all sorts of weather hazards, and storms are more likely to happen there at night, Ashley said. Night storms are deadly because people can’t see them and are less likely to take cover, and they miss warnings in their sleep. The extreme weather triggered by America’s unique geography creates hazards. But it takes humans to turn those hazards into disasters, Ashley and Gensini said. Just look where cities pop up in America and the rest of the world: near water that floods, except maybe Denver, said South Carolina’s Cutter. More people are moving to areas, such as the South, where there are more hazards. READ MORE: After a year of extreme floods and severe drought, what is Missouri doing about climate change? “One of the ways in which you can make your communities more resilient is to not develop them in the most hazard-prone way or in the most hazard-prone portion of the community,” Cutter said. “The insistence on building up barrier islands and development on barrier islands, particularly on the East Coast and the Gulf Coast, knowing that that sand is going to move and having hurricanes hit with some frequency … seems like a colossal waste of money.” Construction standards tend to be at the bare minimum and less likely to survive the storms, Ashley said. “Our infrastructure is crumbling and nowhere near being climate-resilient at all,” Shepherd said. Poverty makes it hard to prepare for and bounce back from disasters, especially in the South, Shepherd said. That vulnerability is an even bigger issue in other places in the world. “Safety can be bought,” Ashley said. “Those that are well-to-do and who have resources can buy safety and will ...

        "content": "Photos and videos of sharks and other marine life swimming in suburban floodwaters make for popular hoaxes during massive storms. But a cellphone video filmed during Hurricane Ian's assault on southwest Florida isn't just another fish story. The eye-popping video, which showed a large, dark fish with sharp dorsal fins thrashing around an inundated Fort Myers backyard, racked up more than 12 million views on Twitter within a day, as users responded with disbelief and comparisons to the \"Sharknado\" film series. Dominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer, confirmed he filmed the clip from his back patio Wednesday morning when he saw something \"flopping around\" in his neighbor's flooded yard. \"I didn't know what it was -- it just looked like a fish or something,\" he told The Associated Press. \"I zoomed in, and all my friends are like, 'It's like a shark, man!'\" He guessed the fish was about four feet (1.2 metres) in length. Experts were of mixed opinion on whether the clip showed a shark or another large fish. George Burgess, former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History's shark program, said in an email that it \"appears to be a juvenile shark,\" while Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, director of the University of Miami's shark conservation program, wrote that \"it's pretty hard to tell.\" Nevertheless, some Twitter users dubbed the hapless fish the \"street shark.\" The surge worsened in Fort Myers as the day went on. Cameratta said the flooding had only just begun when the clip was taken, but that the waters were \"all the way up to our house\" by the time the AP reached him by phone Wednesday evening. He said the fish may have made its way up from nearby Hendry Creek into a retention pond, which then overflowed, spilling the creature into his neighbor's backyard. A visual analysis of nearby property confirmed it matches the physical landmarks in the video. Leslie Guelcher, a professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, was among the online sleuths who initially thought the video was fake. \"Don't think this is real. According to the index on the video it was created in June 2010. Someone else posted it at 10 AM as in Fort Myers, but the storm surge wasn't like that at 10 AM,\" she tweeted Wednesday. Guelcher acknowledged later, though, that online tools she and others were using to establish the video's origins didn't actually show when the video itself was created, merely when the social media profile of the user was created. The AP confirmed through the original clip's metadata that it was captured Wednesday morning. \"It makes a bit more sense from a flooding standpoint,\" she said by email, when informed the fish was spotted near an overflowing pond. \"But how on earth would a shark go from the Gulf of Mexico to a retention pond?\" Yannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, said that most sharks flee shallow bays ahead of hurricanes, possibly tipped off to their arrival by a change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he said, or been washed into it. \"Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters -- rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments -- and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,\" Burgess said. \"Assuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.\" Cameratta sent the video to a group chat on WhatsApp on Wednesday morning, according to his friend John Paul Murray, who sent the AP a timestamped screenshot. \"Amazing content,\" Murray wrote in reply. ------ Associated Press writers Philip Marcelo and Arijeta Lajka in New York contributed to this report.

        "content": "It's common for hoax photos and videos of sharks swimming in flooded streets to surface during hurricanes and they're often quickly debunked. But a new video of a shark in Hurricane Ian's storm surge has people thinking it is the real deal. Hurricane Ian slammed into Florida on Wednesday as a Category 4 hurricane with winds just a few miles per hour away from bumping the classification up to a Category 5. The hurricane resulted in a massive storm surge, and that surge appeared to have pushed a shark into a flooded street in Fort Myers, Florida. While some Twitter users tried to take credit for the video or said they got the video from a friend, the Associated Press has confirmed the video was authentic after speaking with the person who filmed the shark struggling to swim in his backyard. According to the AP report, Dominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer who said he filmed the video Wednesday morning, filmed the shark from his back patio when he saw it flopping around in his neighbor's backyard. Cameratta said at first, he thought the animal was a large fish but soon realized it was a shark. He estimated the shark to be 4 feet long. Cameratta lives near a retention pond, and he said he assumed the shark made it up Hendry Creek and into the pond. The pond then overflowed from storm surge and heavy rain, transporting the shark into the flooded backyard. Some experts told AP they thought the shark looked to be a juvenile. Twitter user THE Alex shared the video at approximately 10 a.m. on Wednesday. The video shows what appears to be a shark flopping around in an apparently flooded street. The animal in the video is seen thrashing its tail back and forth as winds gust in the background. \"My buddy just sent me a video of this shark swimming down his back yard in Fort Myers,\" THE Alex tweeted Wednesday. My buddy just sent me a video of this this shark swimming down his back yard in Fort Myers 😂#hurricane #Ian #HurricaneIan pic.twitter.com/kLon2z3F8Q Leslie Guelcher, an assistant professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University who goes by Dr. G on Twitter, was one of the people who questioned the video's authenticity. Prior to AP's verification, Guelcher tweeted that the video index showed a creation date of June 2010. She later told Newsweek she misread the index data, but she is unconvinced the video is real because the video was taken before the storm surge rose in earnest in Fort Myers. \"I'm still not convinced it is accurate although the person who commented provided the name of who filmed it and where,\" Guelcher said. \"However, a reverse image search on Google, limiting to site:Twitter.com shows a number of posts with at least one being from before the storm surge hit.\" She later said she could see how a shark could go from the Gulf of Mexico into a retention pond. However, some experts expect the shark may have sensed a drop in barometric pressure signifying the approaching hurricane. It may have attempted to flee shallow waters to somewhere safer. However, the shark could have accidentally entered the creek and then the pond in its attempts to flee, or flooding could have forced the animal into the residential area. The video's confirmation was the culmination of five years of searching for Jane Lytvynenko, a freelance reporter who has spent years debunking hoaxes. Before the video was confirmed as real, Lytvynenko implied it had credibility. \"I can't believe I'm looking at an honest-to-god street shark,\" Lytvynenko tweeted. \"Good to finally meet you, pal.\" After over half a decade of debunking this hoax every time there was a flood or hurricane, I can't believe I'm looking at an honest-to-god street shark.Good to finally meet you, pal. https://t.co/hwMWX4Peqo Shark hoaxes have emerged in many hurricanes since a fake image of a shark swimming through a flooded highway was first posted in 2012. Social media agency Storyful also verified the video was authentic but couldn't confirm if the footage showed a small shark or a different fish, such as a cobia. Florida officials warned residents that some wildlife might emerge during the storm, namely bears, alligators and snakes, as wildlife becomes more active and disoriented during massive storms.

        "content": "clockThis article was published more than 1 year ago\nFor years, there has been a deluge of fake videos and memes after major storms that claim to show sharks swimming in flooded streets. So when a video purporting to show a shark in an inundated backyard in Fort Myers, Fla., surfaced during Hurricane Ian this week, gathering millions of views on Twitter, viewers were skeptical.\nBut this time, the recording was real — even if there is no confirmation yet that what it depicted was a shark, according to Storyful, which first authenticated the video, and the Associated Press. The news agencies interviewed Dominic Cameratta, a real estate agent who filmed it with his cellphone, and reviewed the clip’s metadata to confirm it was recorded this week.\nThe video shows a fish that looks to be 4 feet long, with sharp dorsal fins, flipping and flopping in the water. “I didn’t know what it was,” Cameratta said. “I zoomed in, and all my friends were like, ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nExperts interviewed by the AP voiced mixed opinions on whether it was indeed a shark. George Burgess, a former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark program, said the fish appears to be a juvenile shark. But Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami’s shark conservation program, said it was difficult to tell what it was.\nWhat’s been happening with animals in Florida during Hurricane Ian?\nImages purportedly showing sharks in urban areas after hurricanes and major floods have been repeatedly debunked since at least 2011, according to Snopes, a fact-checking website.\nOne image of a shark swimming along a flooded highway was uploaded after Hurricane Irene hit Puerto Rico in August 2011. The same image has been widely recirculated after subsequent storms in different areas: In 2016, it was in Daytona Beach, Fla.; a year later, in Houston; and in 2018, it was in Wrightsville Beach, N.C.\nSnopes reported that the original image from 2011 also was a hoax. It incorporated a 2005 photograph of a kayaker being trailed by a great white shark.\nHurricane Ian has devastated Florida, killing at least 23 people, according to state officials. It made its second landfall in the United States on Friday, hitting coastal South Carolina as a Category 1 storm with lashing rains and strong winds."

        "content": "Photos and videos of sharks and other marine life swimming in suburban floodwaters make for popular hoaxes during massive storms. But a cellphone video filmed during Hurricane Ian's assault on southwest Florida isn't just another fish story. The eye-popping video, which showed a large, dark fish with sharp dorsal fins thrashing around an inundated Fort Myers backyard, racked up more than 12 million views on Twitter within a day, as users responded with disbelief and comparisons to the \"Sharknado\" film series. Dominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer, confirmed he filmed the clip from his back patio Wednesday morning when he saw something \"flopping around\" in his neighbor's flooded yard. \"I didn't know what it was -- it just looked like a fish or something,\" he told The Associated Press. \"I zoomed in, and all my friends are like, 'It's like a shark, man!'\" He guessed the fish was about four feet (1.2 metres) in length. Experts were of mixed opinion on whether the clip showed a shark or another large fish. George Burgess, former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History's shark program, said in an email that it \"appears to be a juvenile shark,\" while Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, director of the University of Miami's shark conservation program, wrote that \"it's pretty hard to tell.\" Nevertheless, some Twitter users dubbed the hapless fish the \"street shark.\" The surge worsened in Fort Myers as the day went on. Cameratta said the flooding had only just begun when the clip was taken, but that the waters were \"all the way up to our house\" by the time the AP reached him by phone Wednesday evening. He said the fish may have made its way up from nearby Hendry Creek into a retention pond, which then overflowed, spilling the creature into his neighbor's backyard. A visual analysis of nearby property confirmed it matches the physical landmarks in the video. Leslie Guelcher, a professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, was among the online sleuths who initially thought the video was fake. \"Don't think this is real. According to the index on the video it was created in June 2010. Someone else posted it at 10 AM as in Fort Myers, but the storm surge wasn't like that at 10 AM,\" she tweeted Wednesday. Guelcher acknowledged later, though, that online tools she and others were using to establish the video's origins didn't actually show when the video itself was created, merely when the social media profile of the user was created. The AP confirmed through the original clip's metadata that it was captured Wednesday morning. \"It makes a bit more sense from a flooding standpoint,\" she said by email, when informed the fish was spotted near an overflowing pond. \"But how on earth would a shark go from the Gulf of Mexico to a retention pond?\" Yannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, said that most sharks flee shallow bays ahead of hurricanes, possibly tipped off to their arrival by a change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he said, or been washed into it. \"Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters -- rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments -- and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,\" Burgess said. \"Assuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.\" Cameratta sent the video to a group chat on WhatsApp on Wednesday morning, according to his friend John Paul Murray, who sent the AP a timestamped screenshot. \"Amazing content,\" Murray wrote in reply. ------ Associated Press writers Philip Marcelo and Arijeta Lajka in New York contributed to this report.

        "content": "Heavy rain caused serious flooding across the region on Friday, leading Gov. Kathy Hochul to declare a state of emergency as rising waters disrupted travel and stranded people in cars and homes. Michael Wilson and Hurubie Meko Heavy rainfall pounded New York City and the surrounding region on Friday, bringing flash floods, shutting down entire subway lines, turning major roadways into lakes and sending children to the upper floors of flooding schoolhouses. Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency, urging New Yorkers to stay home and singling out those who live in basements to brace for the worst. State and city leaders implored residents not to underestimate a storm that flipped from falling rain to fire-hose torrents in minutes. Ms. Hochul called it a “life-threatening rainfall event,” and Mayor Eric Adams called the storm “something that we cannot take lightly and we are not taking lightly.” The city’s residents, while largely caught by surprise, took heed and many stayed home and off the roads. Citywide cellphone pings pushed alerts from the National Weather Service throughout the day, repeatedly extending a “considerable” flash-flood warning, a level reserved for extreme and rare rainfall events. The warning remained in effect through the evening, and the governor cautioned at a news conference against driving despite a lull in the storm. The rain was unpredictable, she said, and it wasn’t entirely clear what areas would be hardest hit overnight. Throughout the day, cascading waterfalls shut down subway lines across much of the city, with service being halted even at major hubs like Barclays Center. Trains were rerouted with little warning. “I have no idea what’s happening,” one subway conductor said as her Q train moved onto the E line. “I don’t know where we’re going.” Commuters turned and ventured back home on foot through scenes of chaos and upheaval. Water gushed into brownstone basements in Park Slope. In Prospect Park, the landscape was altered by new creeks. In Queens, the storm was generational, making Friday the wettest day at Kennedy International Airport since modern record-keeping began. The streets in Windsor Terrace in Brooklyn, a neighborhood built on the slant of a hill, were engulfed in minutes in currents dotted with whitecaps, just as schools were opening their doors. Boys and girls slogged through deep water on 11th Avenue to reach their elementary school classes while neighbors with rakes tried to clear storm drains of dense fallen leaves. “No children are in danger as far as we know,” the governor said. But some schools asked parents to return during the storm to pick up their children, which school officials later said was “precisely the wrong thing to do.” “Truthfully, holding school today knowing this was coming feels irresponsible,” said Jessamyn Lee, a Brooklyn parent of two. By the end of the day, the overall attendance rate at public schools fell to roughly 77 percent, after hovering around 90 percent earlier this week. Several dozen schools across Brooklyn in particular saw more than 4 in 10 students absent. The sense that city leaders were largely caught off guard promised to linger after the rain had stopped falling. Mayor Adams was swiftly criticized for not warning residents about the storm soon enough, and for waiting to address New Yorkers until noontime Friday. Scenes both placid and fraught played out in the city, depending on how hard the rain was falling. Waist-high rivers appeared beneath arched bridges in Central Park. A man in a drenched business suit leaned on a fence by the Great Lawn, and removed his boots one at a time to empty them of water. In Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, a large tree fell, pulling its roots up through a sidewalk and cleaving a parked Nissan. In Windsor Terrace, Bryn Knowles, a former city parks employee in Lake Oswego, Ore., felt her instincts from that rain-soaked region kick in. She picked up a rake and went out to a blocked drain on the corner. “Every major rain event, all the city workers would drop all their tasks, grab their rakes and go and clear storm drains,” she said. “It’s fun — it’s instant gratification, it helps people.” Attention immediately turned to residents who live in flood zones, two years after the remnants of Hurricane Ida caused basement floods that killed 11 people in Queens. Many of those apartments, which are often rented to immigrants or others desperate for an affordable place to live, are not allowed to be rented legally and do not have adequate means of escape in a flood. “Plan your escape route,” Ms. Hochul said. “Don’t wait until water is over your knees before you leave. Don’t wait until it’s too late.” The rain on Friday made this the second-wettest September in New York City history, according to National Weather Service statistics: More than a foot of rain — over 14 inches — has fallen this month, the most in more than 140 years, when the city logged 16.85 inches in September 1882. The storm created havoc for the busiest streets and highways, flooding parts of the F.D.R. Drive and closing down the Belt Parkway. Many flights were canceled or delayed at Kennedy and La Guardia. Over the next few hours, the storm will gradually head east, said Dominic Ramunni, a Weather Service meteorologist. “We’ve got Manhattan on the western edge of it now, with the heaviest rain over Queens and western Nassau County,” he said. But he added, “We’re still dealing with it: We still have that fire hose of moisture coming on shore.” In the Central Park Zoo, the storm brought about an escape: The water rose so high that a female sea lion, named Sally, was able to breach her pool and venture out. She did not get far, with the zoo locked down and employees watching her carefully. Like many New Yorkers on Friday, Sally decided she was better off at home. “She explored the area before returning to the familiar surroundings of the pool,” said Jim Breheny, an ...

        "content": "clockThis article was published more than 1 year ago\nFor years, there has been a deluge of fake videos and memes after major storms that claim to show sharks swimming in flooded streets. So when a video purporting to show a shark in an inundated backyard in Fort Myers, Fla., surfaced during Hurricane Ian this week, gathering millions of views on Twitter, viewers were skeptical.\nBut this time, the recording was real — even if there is no confirmation yet that what it depicted was a shark, according to Storyful, which first authenticated the video, and the Associated Press. The news agencies interviewed Dominic Cameratta, a real estate agent who filmed it with his cellphone, and reviewed the clip’s metadata to confirm it was recorded this week.\nThe video shows a fish that looks to be 4 feet long, with sharp dorsal fins, flipping and flopping in the water. “I didn’t know what it was,” Cameratta said. “I zoomed in, and all my friends were like, ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nExperts interviewed by the AP voiced mixed opinions on whether it was indeed a shark. George Burgess, a former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark program, said the fish appears to be a juvenile shark. But Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami’s shark conservation program, said it was difficult to tell what it was.\nWhat’s been happening with animals in Florida during Hurricane Ian?\nImages purportedly showing sharks in urban areas after hurricanes and major floods have been repeatedly debunked since at least 2011, according to Snopes, a fact-checking website.\nOne image of a shark swimming along a flooded highway was uploaded after Hurricane Irene hit Puerto Rico in August 2011. The same image has been widely recirculated after subsequent storms in different areas: In 2016, it was in Daytona Beach, Fla.; a year later, in Houston; and in 2018, it was in Wrightsville Beach, N.C.\nSnopes reported that the original image from 2011 also was a hoax. It incorporated a 2005 photograph of a kayaker being trailed by a great white shark.\nHurricane Ian has devastated Florida, killing at least 23 people, according to state officials. It made its second landfall in the United States on Friday, hitting coastal South Carolina as a Category 1 storm with lashing rains and strong winds."

        "content": "For golfers, staying out of the water could be the difference between winning and losing. At one course in Australia, it was the difference between life and death. Because Carbrook in Queensland boasted a membership unlike any other golf club on the planet: six resident bull sharks. From their mysterious arrival to their devastating disappearance 17 years later, this is the tale of the sport’s most hazardous water hazard. A lake on a landlocked golf course some 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) from the Pacific Ocean may sound like a swim too far for any fish, but the bull shark has a reputation for dipping its fins into a range of habitats. River shark, freshwater whaler, estuary whaler, swan river whaler – the clue is in its other names. While native to warm and tropical waters worldwide, bull sharks have organs specially adapted to retain salt, allowing them to venture deep into freshwater environments that would prove fatal to other sharks due to a loss of sodium. Hence the presence of the stocky-built, blunt-nosed sharks in the Logan River – which slices inland from the sea halfway between Brisbane and Gold Coast before meandering around Carbrook golf club – came as no real surprise to locals in the 1990s. Neither did severe flooding. Twinned with the region’s subtropical climate, the club has been a hotspot for floods since its inception in 1978, inundated with water on numerous occasions including in 1991, 1995 and 1996. The downpours were so torrential that on the latter three occasions, the roughly 100-meter land bridge separating the river from the sand-mine-turned-lake beside the course’s 14th hole was totally submerged. A new corridor was opened and – sometime during those three temporary windows – six bull sharks glided into uncharted waters. As the land bridge dried and reformed, the door slammed shut behind them. It would remain closed for 17 years, when the next severe flood event reforged a path to the river in 2013. Towards the end of the century, whispers began to trickle around Carbrook’s fairways – all originating from the 14th green. There were reports of loud splashes, large dark shapes moving below the lake’s surface, even laughed-off claims of a tall dorsal fin knifing through the water. “The Carbrook Shark” became a kind of folk legend, Australia’s own Bigfoot, Yeti or – most similarly of all – a local version of another famous lake-dwelling mythical beast. “The Loch Ness monster is pretty similar to what it felt like,” Carbrook general manager Scott Wagstaff told CNN. “It seemed possible but there wasn’t enough truth to it at that point.” That was until the early 2000s, when the Brisbane-based Courier Mail turned folklore into fact by publishing a picture of one of the sharks, Wagstaff recalled. Yet despite having played at the club for years, he had never seen them with his own eyes when he started work there in 2010. Determined to satisfy his curiosity, Wagstaff ventured down to the lake armed with his camera and some meat. No sooner had the bait hit the surface, a shark duly appeared. The stunned Wagstaff snapped some shots before taking a short video on his phone to post online. The footage was – by his own admission – “terrible,” but the internet lapped it up: the viral YouTube video has amassed more than 2.3 million views to date. Media interest boomed, and the club embraced its toothy tenants with vigor. A bull shark was added to the club’s logo, its youth program was named the Junior Shark Academy, and feedings were held at tournaments and corporate events – including one special wedding in 2009 where all six sharks appeared at once, Wagstaff recalls. Despite his affection for the sharks, Wagstaff was reluctant to call them pets, though he did nickname one “Patch,” thanks to its distinct back marking. Compared to the crocodiles and snakes dotting other courses in the country, Carbrook’s sharks made for extremely low-maintenance residents. Only two risk-management steps were taken: warning signage around the lake, and the rejection of any business from prospective golf ball divers, who retrieve balls from course lakes to sell them on. “It’s just not worth the few grand a year we get for a contract to put someone’s life at risk,” Wagstaff said. Fascination spread far beyond Australian borders, piquing the interest of one shark-loving scientist and researcher based at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. Dr. Peter Gausmann published his study on the Carbrook sharks, titled “Who’s the biggest fish in the pond?” in the Marine and Fishery Sciences journal in August 2023. Their extended residence, he argued, sheds new light on just how adaptable bull sharks are. Even without the staff feeding the sharks, hunger was not a cause for concern in a lake 700 meters long, 380 meters wide and 15 meters deep, teeming with fish, from mullets to tarpons and snappers. Gausmann calculated that the sharks would need to consume half a ton of fish per year – or 0.44% of their body weight per day – to meet their energy needs. Having been juveniles when they arrived, sightings verified they had grown to a healthy range of between 1.8 and 3 meters by 2013. Only twice before had bull sharks been recorded surviving for years in isolated bodies of water, according to Gausmann, yet none had ever lasted so long. How to play alongside crocodiles, snakes and kangaroos: Golf, Aussie-style One group made it at least four years in Panama’s freshwater Lake Bayano in the 1980s, while another survived a decade of high salinity in South Africa’s Lake St. Lucia after becoming trapped in 2002. A stay of at least 17 years in low-salinity waters — more than half a bull shark’s lifespan — was unprecedented. “This out of the ordinary occurrence has shown verifiably for the first time how long bull sharks are able to survive in these low-salinity environments,” Gausmann told CNN. “The study has shown that bull sharks presumably have no ...

        "content": "WATCH LIVE Drone footage shot off the coast of Southern California may have revealed the first ever glimpse of a newborn great white shark in the wild. The 1.5-meter-long (5-foot-long) white shark was spotted on July 9, 2023, 400 meters (1,300 feet) off the coast of Carpinteria, California, by wildlife filmmaker Carlos Gauna and Phillip Sternes, a doctoral student in the department of biology at University of California Riverside, while they were shooting aerial video and images. Its pale coloring and size immediately struck the duo as unusual. Adult great white sharks are gray on top and white underneath. Gauna and Sternes examined the images and video in the viewfinder of the drone camera and noticed a thin, white film covering the shark that was sloughing off the animal as it moved. \"We enlarged the images, put them in slow motion, and realized the white layer was being shed from the body as it was swimming,\" Sternes said in a news release. \"I believe it was a newborn white shark shedding its embryonic layer.\" While in utero, embryonic sharks feed on unfertilized eggs for protein. The mothers offer additional nourishment to the growing shark pups with a milk secreted in the uterus. It's some of this material that Gauna and Sternes believe gives the shark its unusual coloring. They documented their observations in a study published Monday in the peer-reviewed Environmental Biology of Fishes journal. \"Given that white sharks produce uterine milk, it is within the realm of possibility that either this fluid or another fluid could have adhered to the shark right before birth,\" the authors noted in the study. If their assessment is correct, it's the first time that a newborn great white shark has been observed in the wild. \"Where white sharks give birth is one of the holy grails of shark science. No one has ever been able to pinpoint where they are born, nor has anyone seen a newborn baby shark alive,\" Gauna said in the news release. \"There have been dead white sharks found inside deceased pregnant mothers. But nothing like this.\" An alternative explanation for the shark's whitish color could be that it was caused by an unknown skin disorder, according to the study. However, Gauna and Sternes said they believe the most plausible answer is that the creature they observed is a newborn great white, according to the news release. Its shape and size were indicative of a newborn: thin with rounded fin apexes, the study noted. In addition, other researchers have suggested this location off the coast of central California is a birthing ground for great white sharks. Gauna and Sternes also noted in the study that mature sharks were spotted in the same area on the same day and the day before the footage was captured. \"In my opinion, this one was likely hours, maybe one day old at most,\" Sternes said. Gavin Naylor, director of the Florida Program for Shark Research at the University of Florida and a curator at the Florida Museum of Natural History, said it is possible the sighting was a newborn great white shark, but added that the finding is \"highly speculative.\" \"White sharks typically have between 8 and 12 pups at a time, so where are all the others,\" Naylor, who wasn't involved in the study, said via email. Nicholas Ray, a researcher at Nottingham Trent University in the UK, who has studied great white shark population dynamics in South Africa, called the sighting documented by Gauna and Sternes \"fantastic.\" \"This observation is hugely significant and is at the start of scientists' understanding of the elusive reproductive cycles of this endangered species. It could unlock the door as a new discovery and reinforce the need for greater protection in these areas,\" said Ray, who wasn't involved with this study, in an email. That the shark pup was filmed so close to the coast could be significant because its age means it was likely born in shallow waters. Other shark experts believe great whites are born farther out at sea, according to the news release. \"It has been hypothesized by other researchers that white sharks are born in shallow, coastal waters in this region, but never observed,\" said Greg Skomal, senior fisheries scientist at the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries and author of the book \"Chasing Shadows: My Life Tracking the Great White Shark.\" \"While the presence of this young white shark in this area supports this hypothesis, the actual birth was not observed. We cannot rule out that the shark, which is quite mobile, could have moved a great distance from the birthing area. Regardless, this is a very exciting observation.\" The observations require \"further investigation and additional evidence for support or refutation,\" according to the study. \"Nevertheless, in either case, the use of the aerial drone has provided shark science with another interesting set of information,\" the study authors added.

One shark even swam away with a bale.\nSubsequently, the duo also explored highly concentrated fish powder and noticed how it induced a dopamine response in sharks, akin to what cocaine might trigger in addicted individuals. Which led to sharks acting extremely hyper.\n\"I think we have got a potential scenario of what it may look like if you gave sharks cocaine,\" Hird said in the film. \"We gave them what I think is the next best thing. [It] set [their] brains aflame. It was crazy.\"\nHowever, Hird told Live Science that they still don't know what cocaine could do to a shark and that the experiment doesn't really show if sharks are actually consuming cocaine, but rather that they could also be consuming multiple other pharmaceuticals that land in the ocean, such as lidocaine, amphetamine, antidepressants, and even birth control.\nIn 2015, a U.S. Geological Survey revealed that fish nationwide were exposed to 17a-ethinylestradiol (EE2), a key component of oral birth control pills. This exposure resulted from the chemical entering waterways through human waste and the disposal of unused pills down drains. \nHird also said, that while the sharks did show similar behaviors to those of an addict, many other factors could explain their behavior, and more experiments, research, and blood tests are needed to fully confirm that these are indeed cocaine-consuming sharks.\nTrending stories at Scrippsnews.com"
