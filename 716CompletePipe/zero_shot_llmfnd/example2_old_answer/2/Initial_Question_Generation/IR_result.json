                "content": "Hurricane Shark and Street Shark are nicknames for several claimed instances of a live shark swimming in a flooded urban area, typically in the aftermath of a hurricane. For more than a decade (starting with Hurricane Irene in 2011), all media purporting to document such claims—most notably an image of a shark swimming on a flooded freeway—were debunked as fabrications. However, during Hurricane Ian in 2022, the Associated Press verified a video taken by Dominic Cameratta of a shark or other large fish swimming in flooded Fort Myers, Florida; one consulted expert concluded that the fish was \"a juvenile shark\" while another was unable to determine whether it was a shark.[1] Both the re-emergence of the hoax in hurricane after hurricane and the eventual appearance of a plausible claim have been the subject of commentary and amusement; Daniel Victor of The New York Times described the Associated Press's findings as \"like discovering Bigfoot is real\".[2] The original \"Hurricane Shark\" image was created during Hurricane Irene in 2011, with a claim that the shark was on a street in Puerto Rico.[2] According to The Washington Post, it likely originated on Reddit.[3] In the aftermath of the hurricane, the image was aired by Miami Fox affiliate WSVN,[3] was posted by the Miami Herald, and was widely shared on social media websites including Twitter.[4] The image was debunked by the Post,[3] Snopes.com,[5] and the Toronto Star.[4] It had been created by combining an image of a flooded street in Puerto Rico with a photo of a shark taken by Thomas P. Peschak off of South Africa in 2003.[4] The Post compared it to similar hoax images, such as one supposedly of Osama bin Laden's body following his death.[3] Craig Silverman, writing in the Star, cast it as part of a larger phenomenon of hoax images appearing in the aftermath of significant events.[4] The image has frequently resurfaced on the internet with claims that it was taken during various flooding events,[2] including in Houston during both the 2015 Texas–Oklahoma flood and tornado outbreak and the 2017 floods caused by Hurricane Harvey, and in Daytona Beach, Florida, in 2016 during floods caused by Hurricane Matthew.[5] Peschak has said his fans notify him each time the image re-emerges, but that \"they're more outraged than I am\".[6] After Toronto's Union Station flooded in June 2012, a manipulated image circulated purporting to show two sharks at the base of an escalator bank. The image was later reused in a hoax claiming that a shark tank had burst at the Kuwait Scientific Center.[7][8] While the flooding in Toronto was not the result of a hurricane, the hoax has often been compared to the main Hurricane Shark hoax.[2][9] Later in 2012, after Hurricane Sandy struck New Jersey, other fake shark images circulated in addition to the better-known freeway one. One image appears to depict a shark outside of a home in a suburban area.[10][11] Another appears to show a shark swimming down a suburban street.[12][13] Tom Phillips and Alexis Madrigal found the real shark image used to create the former; Snopes did the same for the latter.[10][13][11] During both Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Florence, fake television breaking news screen captures were seen online saying that the hurricane \"now contains sharks\", although neither contained images of sharks.[14] No, Hurricane Florence does not contain sharks September 13, 2018[15] Hurricane sharks as hoaxes have taken on a life of their own, in social media and in the press. Doctored photos of sharks swimming in urban areas went viral on social media in virtually every disastrous storm and hurricane in the decade since, often copies of the image that first circulated during Irene.[15] Some on social media have treated the Hurricane Shark as a meme, an in-joke hoax to be revived with each disaster, while others have genuinely believed in the authenticity of the photos being spread.[2] Commentators have made comparisons to Sharknado, a film series that also involves sharks caught up in natural disasters.[16][1] In response to the \"now contains sharks\" images circulated during Hurricane Florence, FEMA's Associate Director of Office of Response and Recovery, Jeffrey Byard, denied that \"there's a sharknado effect or anything like that\".[14] Because of the recurring nature of the meme, fact-checkers and journalists in the media have repeatedly needed to clarify that the images of Hurricane sharks were hoaxes. According to Daniel Victor, writing for The New York Times in 2022, Hurricane Shark is the \"longtime nemesis\" of fact-checkers on social media.[2] In Silverman's Verification Handbook, Phillips makes a case study of his work with Madrigal during Hurricane Sandy, describing the images they reviewed as \"strange enough to make you suspicious, yet [not] implausible enough to dismiss out of hand\".[10][13] Rose Eveleth, in a 2014 piece for BBC Future about how to spot fake Sandy photos, includes as her list's final item, \"If it has a shark in it, it's probably fake\".[9] An early claim of sharks in a flooded urban area, predating the original Hurricane Shark hoax, occurred in Goodna, Queensland, Australia, amidst major flooding in January 2011.[4] Butcher Steve Bateman reported a shark, roughly 6 feet (1.8 m) in length, swimming past his shop, and several others reported seeing a shark on a different street.[17] Two local politicians vouched for Bateman's credibility, and The Queensland Times noted that sharks are known to swim up the Bremer River to Goodna.[18] In September 2022, after Hurricane Ian struck Florida, a video emerged online of a shark in a flooded backyard in Fort Myers, Florida, drawing over 12 million views within a day.[1] Initially, the video received skepticism from journalists and fact-checkers, wary of the long history of similar media being hoaxes while also noting that the video seemed more authentic than previous renditions.[2] On September 29, the Associated Press, while noting the history of the Hurricane Shark, confirmed the authenticity of the video based on analysis of the video's metadata and an interview with the videographer, Dominic Cameratta. The Associated Press consulted shark experts George H. Burgess and ... [Content truncated]",

                "content": "It happens every time there’s a hurricane – the shark photos, memes, and old videos showing ‘proof’ that a shark (usually one that looks like a great white) is taking advantage of flooded streets and malls to search for… well, who knows what. For years both journalists and shark scientists have had to put up with the deluge of fake images and videos, telling the public the same message: “this is fake.” In fact, even the Twitter page for Snopes has begged people to stop sharing the proven false photos and videos. So, it was to no one’s surprise when a video popped up after Hurricane Ian made landfall in Florida claiming to capture a shark in floodwaters.\nThis video, however, was different.\n“I didn’t know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,” Cameratta told news outlets. ... [+] “I zoomed in, and all my friends are like: ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nPast hoax videos usually showed sharks in flooded malls or swimming down highways, but this one seemed to be in someone’s backyard near Fort Myers, Florida. The fact that this was a new video garnered a lot of attention, racking up millions of views on Twitter. The skepticism was rampant – and warranted. The first question many asked was, “Is this an actual video?” An answer quickly came with both Storyful and The Associated Press confirming its authenticity through examination of the video’s metadata and subsequent interviews. AP got the scoop from local real estate agent Dominic Cameratta, who confirmed he filmed the clip himself on Wednesday morning. “I didn’t know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,” he told news outlets. “I zoomed in, and all my friends are like: ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nSo, the clip is real. But is that really a shark?\nIt’s hard to tell – and even shark scientists are stumped. George Burgess, a former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark program, told the Washington Post that the fish in the video appears to be a juvenile shark. “Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters — rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments — and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,” Burgess said. “Assuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.”\n“Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters — rivers, estuaries, subtropical ... [+] embayments — and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,” Burgess says.\nDr. Yannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, is on the fence about the video. Papastamatiou pointed to the science that shows many shark species are known to flee shallow, coastal regions ahead of hurricanes, possibly being tipped off to the giant storm’s arrival by a drastic change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he reckons, or been washed into it.\nBut Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami’s shark conservation program, isn’t as convinced, saying it was difficult to tell what exactly the fish was. It should be of note that the video caught the fish swimming near a pond that was overflowing, causing some experts to lean towards this just being an escapee.\nIt seems we will never have a definitive answer to this mystery. While shark experts are split over the identification, some Twitter users were convinced and have dubbed the grainy fish a “street shark.” Perhaps this is a new rendition for “Baby Shark” writers to pick up and write a song about?\n\nOne Community.

                "content": "When Hurricane Nicole hit Florida on Wednesday night with wind, rain and flooding battering the state, a common hoax resurfaced. A video of fin-like objects being swept down a flooded road on the Sunshine State's east coast sparked a joke that the objects were two sharks carried through the streets by the rushing water.\nThe Category 1 storm hit the coast that was already vulnerable from Hurricane Ian, which hammered the state six weeks ago. Residents were urged to evacuate in certain areas as floodwaters cascaded down roadways. As residents were evacuating, one video shows a car stopped at a flooded intersection and debris carried by the floodwaters rushing through the intersection.\nThe Instagram video, posted by user ohana_surf_shop on Wednesday morning, showed two fin-like objects swept along by floodwaters near an intersection where the user was stopped in his car. The video taker joked, \"There goes a shark, we've got a couple sharks,\" as the objects floated by. Another person in the car laughed during the video.\nThe post's caption said, \"Sharks on the streets!!\" and included hashtags for \"Sharknado,\" a made-for-TV science fiction comedy disaster movie that is commonly referenced when shark hoaxes resurface during hurricanes.\nStoryful, a social media intelligence agency, shared the video and said it was taken by Jordan Schwartz, a local man who owns Ohana Surf Shop in Stuart, Florida.\nThe video was taken after residents received evacuation orders when storm surges breached the coast and flooding overwhelmed local streets. Schwartz also recorded more debris transported by floodwaters down the roadway, including a kayak.\nSchwartz told Newsweek that at first, the debris did look like sharks.\n\"It looks real all the way through,\" he said in an Instagram message. \"So we were kinda in shock and [definitely] thought we had sharks at the beginning.\"\nSchwartz said that as soon as the debris floated past the car in front of him, he realized it wasn't a shark. He said he wasn't aware of the common shark hoaxes that surface during hurricanes when he took the video.\n\"Actually amazed how much feedback we got from this,\" he said.\nSchwartz shared the video twice on his Instagram page. The first was liked nearly 3,900 times and the second nearly 3,000 times.\nShark appearances are common hoaxes that originated in 2012 when a fake image of a shark was depicted swimming down a flooded highway. Since then, the image and others have surfaced on social media whenever a hurricane hits.\nMost recently, a man videoed what appeared to be a shark flopping around in his neighbor's backyard in Fort Myers, Florida, during severe storm surge from Hurricane Ian.\nAfter the video index was confirmed, experts said it's possible that a shark sensed a drop in barometric pressure that preceded the hurricane and, trying to flee, accidentally ended up in a retention pond which, when flooded, tossed the shark into someone's backyard. Storyful, a social media intelligence agency, verified the Fort Myers video was authentic but couldn't determine if the animal was actually a shark or a large fish.\nThe Hurricane Ian shark is an anomaly, and many shark-like objects sighted during hurricanes are later determined to be debris or fake images.\nUpdate 11/10/22, 11:04 a.m. ET: This story was updated with comment from Jordan Schwartz.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nAnna Skinner is a Newsweek senior reporter based in Indianapolis.

Hurricane Idalia was bearing down on the region overnight, with mandatory evacuations in at least 19 counties, roads flooding and the danger becoming increasingly more clear. T​he storm was projected to make landfall in North Florida with storm surge up to 16 feet, but brings the potential for flooding, wind and other impacts to communities on the east side of its path, including the Tampa Bay area. (​MORE: The Latest Forecast For Hurricane Idalia | Maps Tracker) H​ere are our live updates as the situation unfolded Tuesday: I​dalia is currently in the Gulf of Mexico, about 185 miles south of Tallahassee. The National Hurricane Center is forecasting it to be an extremely dangerous Category 4 storm at landfall in Florida's Big Bend region. If so, it would be the first Category 4 storm on record there. Storm surge could reach 12 feet to 16 feet. From weather.com digital meteorologist Jonathan Belles: Conditions across much of north Florida and southern Georgia will continue to deteriorate through the night and into the early morning hours. Bands of rain will become more frequent, winds will increase and water levels near the Gulf will also increase substantially. The worst conditions will most likely be in the Florida Big Bend near and just after sunrise. There will be several hours where it may be life-threatening to be outside of a sturdy structure as the core of the hurricane moves through. Wind gusts in a narrow corridor may eclipse 100 mph. A​bout 5,500 Florida National Guard troops have been mobilized, nearly half of the entire force. The activation includes personnel from the 111th Aviation Regiment based in Jacksonville. From weather.com senior meteorologist Jonathan Erdman: We've been able to see the hurricane's eye in radar imagery all day. Now the eye has cleared out in infrared satellite imagery. That's another sign it's intensifying. S​chools are closed until at least Thursday morning in 46 of Florida's 67 counties, according to a list compiled by the state Department of Education. The largest school districts among them include Brevard, Duval, Hillsborough, Lee, Orange, Pinellas and Polk. M​ore than 300 members of the Florida Highway Patrol are standing by to help escort utility crews and other emergency personnel after the storm passes, according to a social media post from Gov. Ron DeSantis. There 700 state Department of Transportation employees and 400 pieces of heavy equipment prepared to clear roadways. S​ome 4,000 inmates have been evacuated or relocated across Florida. According to an update from the state this evening: \"Evacuation determinations are made in the best interest of the public, staff and inmate safety. Multiple satellite facilities, community work release centers and work camps were evacuated in an abundance of caution. Inmates were relocated to larger main units (parent facilities), better equipped to weather the storm.\" T​he Florida capital city's airport will shut down at 11 p.m. eastern time tonight. Airports in Tampa, St. Petersburg-Clearwater and Sarasota have already closed. Sarasota plans to reopen tomorrow morning, pending damage assessments. St. Pete-Clearwater is expected to reopen at 3 p.m. tomorrow and Tampa anticipates remaining closed until Thursday morning. The center of the storm is about 245 miles south of Tallahassee, in the southern Gulf of Mexico. Wind gusts over 50 mph have been measured in some spots in southwest Florida. Maximum sustained winds are 105 mph, a slight increase in the past few hours. Six urban search and rescue team members from California are deploying to Orlando, Florida, and three to Atlanta, according to a statement from California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office. P​hotos from Sanibel Fire Rescue District showed waves crashing over a portion of the Sanibel Causeway in Southwest Florida. The causeway is still undergoing repairs after extensive damage from Hurricane Ian last year. Residents are being told to stay off the bridge during the storm. A​ mandatory evacuation order went into effect at 4:30 p.m. eastern time for everyone in Gilchrist County. The county, with a population of about 19,000 people, sits in a rural area between Gainesville and the Gulf of Mexico. P​ortions of at least 18 other counties are also under mandatory evacuation orders, mostly for areas or structures most vulnerable to flooding. They include: Citrus, Dixie, Franklin, Gilchrist, Gulf, Hillsborough, Jefferson, Lafayette, Leon, Levy, Manatee, Nassau, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, St. Johns, Suwannee, Taylor and Wakulla. From weather.com senior meteorologist Jonathan Erdman: We'll likely remember Idalia most for the prolific storm surge along Florida's Big Bend. In a few areas, Idalia's peak surge could exceed the up to 12-foot surge during the March 1993 Superstorm and the 10 to 13-foot surge during the Sept. 1896 hurricane. Time is running out. Water will rise overnight. We cannot stress enough how vital it is to evacuate, immediately, if you've been ordered to do so by local officials. You don't want to be there when a surge of that magnitude, with battering waves, arrives. It may be the last thing you ever do. All aircraft at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa have been evacuated or secured in preparation for Idalia. A video recorded by one of the planes evacuation captured a lightning phenomenon known as St. Elmo's Fire M​acDill Air Force Base is home to about 30 different aircraft, including a dozen KC-135 refuelers, according to the base website. About 6,600 military and civilian personnel are stationed there. It's located on a peninsula that juts into Tampa Bay south of the city's downtown. W​ith maximum sustained winds of 100 mph, Idalia has been upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane. The storm could strengthen more before landfall. H​urricanes are ranked one through five based on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. A Category 2 storm packs winds between 96 mph and 110 ... [Content truncated]",

                "content": "NWS All NOAA Privacy Policy Tampa Bay Area, FL Weather Forecast Office West Central and Southwest Florida Heavy Rainfall Event: June 10-13, 2024 As a tropical disturbance and surge of moisture lifted northward over portions of the Florida peninsula during the week of June 10th, several rounds of heavy rainfall occurred across West Central and Southwest Florida. Over the course of the week, many locations experienced significant heavy rainfall. Several daily (and even hourly) records were broken during the week. In some locations, much of this rainfall fell during a very short duration, leading to flooding. January 09, 2024 Severe Weather Event On January 09, 2024 a potent storm system moved across the Florida peninsula. As the storm system approached, a warm and humid air mass lifting northward over the state produced strong winds not associated with any storms. Just ahead of the cold front, a squall line pushed through the region producing an EF-1 tornado in Northern Hillsborough County, an EF-0 tornado in Pinellas County, and damaging straight-line winds in Sarasota County, FL. Gulf Low and Coastal Flooding Event on December 17, 2023 A wave of low pressure formed in the central Gulf of Mexico along the remnant stationary frontal boundary on Saturday, 16 December 2023, and moved northeast over the Florida peninsula on Sunday, 17 December 2023, bringing above normal water levels, particularly at high tide. Tornado Outbreak on October 11-12, 2023 Western Florida experienced one of its more significant tornado events during the evening of October 11th through the morning of October 12th. Six tornadoes affected the area, with 2 of them being significant (rated EF-2 or stronger) with maximum estimated winds of 115 and 125 mph. The first of the significant tornadoes moved across Pinellas County near Clearwater Beach and Dunedin, and the other near Crystal River in Citrus County. Elsewhere, EF-0 tornadoes affected Sarasota and Pasco counties, and another 2 hit parts of Pinellas County separate from the EF-2. The 6 total confirmed tornadoes represents the 8th most tornadoes in any single event for the area, and the event is tied for 15th when ranking events by total number of tornadoes. Fortunately, no fatalities or significant injuries were reported, which is especially remarkable given the strength of the tornadoes and the fact that most of them occurred during the overnight hours. Major Hurricane Idalia Hurricane Idalia began as a disorganized cluster of thunderstorms that moved across Central America from the Pacific Ocean and into the southern Caribbean Sea. On August 26, 2023, the system became Tropical Depression Ten and slowly continued to organize over the next few days while remaining almost stationary in the northwest Caribbean Sea. On August 27th, Tropical Depression Ten became Tropical Storm Idalia. By the early hours of August 28th, Idalia had become a hurricane and began to move towards the north. As Idalia moved north, the storm continued to intensify, eventually reaching category three strength as it made its final approach to the Florida peninsula on the morning of August 30, 2023. Tornadoes in Pasco→Hernando, Pinellas, and Sarasota Counties During the week of December 12, 2022, a powerful winter storm system moved eastward across the United States. Blizzard conditions developed in the Northern Plains, and a severe weather outbreak occurred across Texas, Oklahoma, and into the southeast United States. On December 15th, this storm system arrived in the vicinity of the Florida peninsula. Ushered along by the sharp change in temperature, a cold front moved into the region. Ahead of this front, a line of storms developed over the Gulf - bringing with it two EF1 tornadoes, an EF0 tornado, and some damaging wind gusts. Hurricane Nicole Hurricane Nicole first formed on November 7th as a sprawling low pressure system began to take on subtropical characteristics. As the system began to organize and the wind field contracted, Nicole became a Tropical Storm on Tuesday, November 8th. Nicole continued to intensify to a Category 1 Hurricane on November 9th after making landfall in the northern Bahamas. The storm would go on to make landfall along the Florida east coast near Vero Beach during the early morning hours of November 10th. Substantial impacts were felt along the east coast of the state as hurricane-force winds, heavy rainfall, and high surf battered the region of the coastline still reeling from Hurricane Ian. Some of this heavy rainfall and stronger wind also impacted West Central and Southwest Florida. Major Hurricane Ian Hurricane Ian started out as a tropical wave off the coast of Africa in mid-September. Over the course of a couple weeks, this disorganized wave would move westward, eventually arriving in the Caribbean Sea. On the morning of September 23rd, south of the the islands of Puerto Rico and Hispañola, Ian would become a tropical depression. Later that same day, tropical storm Ian would form. As Ian intensified in the Caribbean Sea, the storm made a northward turn and made landfall in western Cuba. After emerging off the northwest Cuban coast, Ian underwent a period of rapid intensification as it moved north and then northeast towards Florida, intensify into a Catgory 4 Hurricane with sustained winds of 150 mph. Ian made landfall at 305 PM on September 28, 2022, as a Category 4 Major Hurricane near Cayo Costa in Southwest Florida. Storm surge of 10 to 15 feet battered the barrier islands south of the landfall with historic rainfall amounts up to nearly 27 inches causing major flooding over inland areas. Damaging Hail on April 4, 2022 April 4, 2022, a significant hail event occurred in Highlands County, Florida in association with afternoon thunderstorms that developed across the Florida peninsula. Take a look at the events that unfolded, and what caused the occurrence of such a storm.

Beyond the Data is written and edited by Derek Arndt, Jake Crouch, Jessica Blunden (NOAA NCEI), and Rebecca Lindsey (contractor to NOAA CPO). Posts reflect the views of the bloggers or guest contributors themselves, not necessarily those of Climate.gov, NOAA, or NCEI. The NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) has released the final update to its 2022 Billion-dollar disaster report (www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions), confirming another intense year of costly disasters and extremes throughout much of the country. 2022 tied 2017 and 2011 for the third highest number of billion-dollar disasters. 2022 was also third highest in total costs (behind 2017 and 2005), with a price tag of at least $165.0 billion. This total annual cost may rise by several billion when we’ve fully accounted for the costs of the December 21-26 Central and Eastern winter storm/cold wave.

For best viewing, click to see full-size versions of these images, or visit the NCEI web tool directly. In 2022, the U.S. experienced 18 separate weather and climate disasters costing at least 1 billion dollars. That number puts 2022 into a three-way tie with 2017 and 2011 for the third-highest number of billion-dollar disasters in a calendar year, behind the 22 events in 2020 and the 20 events in 2021. It was another year with a high diversity of destructive disasters: In 2022, the United States experienced 18 separate weather or climate disasters that each resulted in at least $1 billion in damages. NOAA map by NCEI. 2022 was also deadly, in that the 18 events of 2022 caused at least 474 direct or indirect fatalities—the 8th most disaster-related fatalities for the contiguous U.S. since 1980. Damages from the 2022 disasters totaled $165.1 billion. (All cost estimates are adjusted based on the Consumer Price Index, 2022). The costliest 2022 events were Hurricane Ian ($112.9 billion) and the Western and Central Drought / Heat Wave ($22.1 billion). Adding the 2022 events to the record that began in 1980, the U.S. has sustained 341 weather and climate disasters with the overall damage costs reaching or exceeding $1 billion. The cumulative cost for these 341 events exceeds $2.475 trillion. Like many years in the past decade, 2022 was another active year during which we had a high frequency, a high cost, and large diversity of extreme events that affect people's lives and livelihoods—concerning because it hints that the extremely high activity of recent years is becoming the new normal. 2022 (red line) marks the eighth consecutive year (2015-2022) in which 10 or more separate billion-dollar disaster events have impacted the U.S. The 1980–2022 annual average (black line) is 7.9 events (CPI-adjusted); the annual average for the most recent 5 years (2018–2022) is 17.8 events (CPI-adjusted). Month-by-month accumulation of billion-dollar disasters for each year on record. The colored lines represent the top 6 years for most billion-dollar disasters. All other years are colored light gray. NOAA image by NCEI. Over the last seven years (2016-2022), 122 separate billion-dollar disasters have killed at least 5,000 people and cost >$1 trillion in damage. In addition, the $100 billion cost figure has been eclipsed in 5 of the last six years (2017-2022 with 2019 being the exception). One of the drivers of this cost is that the U.S. has been impacted by landfalling Category 4 or 5 hurricanes in five of the last six years, including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, Michael, Laura, Ida, and Ian. Month-by-month accumulation of estimated costs of each year's billion-dollar disasters, with colored lines showing 2022 (red) and the previous top-5 costliest years. Other years are light gray. 2022 finished the year in third place for annual costs. NOAA NCEI graphic. In broader context, the total cost of U.S. billion-dollar disasters over the last 5 years (2018-2022) is $595.5 billion, with a 5-year annual cost average of $119.1 billion, the latter of which is nearly triple the 43-year inflation adjusted annual average cost. The U.S. billion-dollar disaster damage costs over the last 10-years (2013-2022) were also historically large: at least $1.1 trillion from 152 separate billion-dollar events. It is important to keep in mind that these estimates do not reflect the total cost of U.S. weather and climate disasters, only those associated with events more than $1 billion in damages. That means they are a conservative estimate of how much extreme weather costs the United States each year. However, these billion-dollar events do account for most of the damage from all recorded U.S. weather and climate events (NCEI; Munich Re), and they are becoming an increasingly larger percentage of the total damage costs from weather-related events at all scales and loss levels. The U.S. losses from billion-dollar disasters over the last seven years (2015-2022) are more than $1 trillion and have further skewed the total distribution of extreme weather costs. From 1980-2000, about 75% of all disaster-related costs were due to billion-dollar disasters, and by 2010, the percentage had risen to about 80%. By 2022, it has risen to ~85% of all disaster-related costs, or $2.475 trillion out of $2.850 trillion. The number and cost of weather and climate disasters are increasing in the United States due to a combination of increased exposure (i.e., more assets at risk), vulnerability (i.e., how much damage a hazard of given intensity—wind speed, or flood depth, for example—causes at a location), and the fact that climate change is increasing the frequency of some types of extremes that lead to billion-dollar disasters (NCA 2018, Chapter 2).
