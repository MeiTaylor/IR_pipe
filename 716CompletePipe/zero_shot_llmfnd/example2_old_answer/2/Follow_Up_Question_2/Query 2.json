Because Carbrook in Queensland boasted a membership unlike any other golf club on the planet: six resident bull sharks. From their mysterious arrival to their devastating disappearance 17 years later, this is the tale of the sport’s most hazardous water hazard. A lake on a landlocked golf course some 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) from the Pacific Ocean may sound like a swim too far for any fish, but the bull shark has a reputation for dipping its fins into a range of habitats. River shark, freshwater whaler, estuary whaler, swan river whaler – the clue is in its other names. While native to warm and tropical waters worldwide, bull sharks have organs specially adapted to retain salt, allowing them to venture deep into freshwater environments that would prove fatal to other sharks due to a loss of sodium. Hence the presence of the stocky-built, blunt-nosed sharks in the Logan River – which slices inland from the sea halfway between Brisbane and Gold Coast before meandering around Carbrook golf club – came as no real surprise to locals in the 1990s. Neither did severe flooding. Twinned with the region’s subtropical climate, the club has been a hotspot for floods since its inception in 1978, inundated with water on numerous occasions including in 1991, 1995 and 1996. The downpours were so torrential that on the latter three occasions, the roughly 100-meter land bridge separating the river from the sand-mine-turned-lake beside the course’s 14th hole was totally submerged. A new corridor was opened and – sometime during those three temporary windows – six bull sharks glided into uncharted waters. As the land bridge dried and reformed, the door slammed shut behind them. It would remain closed for 17 years, when the next severe flood event reforged a path to the river in 2013. Towards the end of the century, whispers began to trickle around Carbrook’s fairways – all originating from the 14th green. There were reports of loud splashes, large dark shapes moving below the lake’s surface, even laughed-off claims of a tall dorsal fin knifing through the water. “The Carbrook Shark” became a kind of folk legend, Australia’s own Bigfoot, Yeti or – most similarly of all – a local version of another famous lake-dwelling mythical beast. “The Loch Ness monster is pretty similar to what it felt like,” Carbrook general manager Scott Wagstaff told CNN. “It seemed possible but there wasn’t enough truth to it at that point.” That was until the early 2000s, when the Brisbane-based Courier Mail turned folklore into fact by publishing a picture of one of the sharks, Wagstaff recalled. Yet despite having played at the club for years, he had never seen them with his own eyes when he started work there in 2010. Determined to satisfy his curiosity, Wagstaff ventured down to the lake armed with his camera and some meat. No sooner had the bait hit the surface, a shark duly appeared. The stunned Wagstaff snapped some shots before taking a short video on his phone to post online. The footage was – by his own admission – “terrible,” but the internet lapped it up: the viral YouTube video has amassed more than 2.3 million views to date. Media interest boomed, and the club embraced its toothy tenants with vigor. A bull shark was added to the club’s logo, its youth program was named the Junior Shark Academy, and feedings were held at tournaments and corporate events – including one special wedding in 2009 where all six sharks appeared at once, Wagstaff recalls. Despite his affection for the sharks, Wagstaff was reluctant to call them pets, though he did nickname one “Patch,” thanks to its distinct back marking. Compared to the crocodiles and snakes dotting other courses in the country, Carbrook’s sharks made for extremely low-maintenance residents. Only two risk-management steps were taken: warning signage around the lake, and the rejection of any business from prospective golf ball divers, who retrieve balls from course lakes to sell them on. “It’s just not worth the few grand a year we get for a contract to put someone’s life at risk,” Wagstaff said. Fascination spread far beyond Australian borders, piquing the interest of one shark-loving scientist and researcher based at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. Dr. Peter Gausmann published his study on the Carbrook sharks, titled “Who’s the biggest fish in the pond?” in the Marine and Fishery Sciences journal in August 2023. Their extended residence, he argued, sheds new light on just how adaptable bull sharks are. Even without the staff feeding the sharks, hunger was not a cause for concern in a lake 700 meters long, 380 meters wide and 15 meters deep, teeming with fish, from mullets to tarpons and snappers. Gausmann calculated that the sharks would need to consume half a ton of fish per year – or 0.44% of their body weight per day – to meet their energy needs. Having been juveniles when they arrived, sightings verified they had grown to a healthy range of between 1.8 and 3 meters by 2013. Only twice before had bull sharks been recorded surviving for years in isolated bodies of water, according to Gausmann, yet none had ever lasted so long. How to play alongside crocodiles, snakes and kangaroos: Golf, Aussie-style One group made it at least four years in Panama’s freshwater Lake Bayano in the 1980s, while another survived a decade of high salinity in South Africa’s Lake St. Lucia after becoming trapped in 2002. A stay of at least 17 years in low-salinity waters — more than half a bull shark’s lifespan — was unprecedented. “This out of the ordinary occurrence has shown verifiably for the first time how long bull sharks are able to survive in these low-salinity environments,” Gausmann told CNN. “The study has shown that bull sharks presumably have no ...

One shark even swam away with a bale.\nSubsequently, the duo also explored highly concentrated fish powder and noticed how it induced a dopamine response in sharks, akin to what cocaine might trigger in addicted individuals. Which led to sharks acting extremely hyper.\n\"I think we have got a potential scenario of what it may look like if you gave sharks cocaine,\" Hird said in the film. \"We gave them what I think is the next best thing. [It] set [their] brains aflame. It was crazy.\"\nHowever, Hird told Live Science that they still don't know what cocaine could do to a shark and that the experiment doesn't really show if sharks are actually consuming cocaine, but rather that they could also be consuming multiple other pharmaceuticals that land in the ocean, such as lidocaine, amphetamine, antidepressants, and even birth control.\nIn 2015, a U.S. Geological Survey revealed that fish nationwide were exposed to 17a-ethinylestradiol (EE2), a key component of oral birth control pills. This exposure resulted from the chemical entering waterways through human waste and the disposal of unused pills down drains. \nHird also said, that while the sharks did show similar behaviors to those of an addict, many other factors could explain their behavior, and more experiments, research, and blood tests are needed to fully confirm that these are indeed cocaine-consuming sharks.\nTrending stories at Scrippsnews.com",

                    "content": "WATCH LIVE Drone footage shot off the coast of Southern California may have revealed the first ever glimpse of a newborn great white shark in the wild. The 1.5-meter-long (5-foot-long) white shark was spotted on July 9, 2023, 400 meters (1,300 feet) off the coast of Carpinteria, California, by wildlife filmmaker Carlos Gauna and Phillip Sternes, a doctoral student in the department of biology at University of California Riverside, while they were shooting aerial video and images. Its pale coloring and size immediately struck the duo as unusual. Adult great white sharks are gray on top and white underneath. Gauna and Sternes examined the images and video in the viewfinder of the drone camera and noticed a thin, white film covering the shark that was sloughing off the animal as it moved. \"We enlarged the images, put them in slow motion, and realized the white layer was being shed from the body as it was swimming,\" Sternes said in a news release. \"I believe it was a newborn white shark shedding its embryonic layer.\" While in utero, embryonic sharks feed on unfertilized eggs for protein. The mothers offer additional nourishment to the growing shark pups with a milk secreted in the uterus. It's some of this material that Gauna and Sternes believe gives the shark its unusual coloring. They documented their observations in a study published Monday in the peer-reviewed Environmental Biology of Fishes journal. \"Given that white sharks produce uterine milk, it is within the realm of possibility that either this fluid or another fluid could have adhered to the shark right before birth,\" the authors noted in the study. If their assessment is correct, it's the first time that a newborn great white shark has been observed in the wild. \"Where white sharks give birth is one of the holy grails of shark science. No one has ever been able to pinpoint where they are born, nor has anyone seen a newborn baby shark alive,\" Gauna said in the news release. \"There have been dead white sharks found inside deceased pregnant mothers. But nothing like this.\" An alternative explanation for the shark's whitish color could be that it was caused by an unknown skin disorder, according to the study. However, Gauna and Sternes said they believe the most plausible answer is that the creature they observed is a newborn great white, according to the news release. Its shape and size were indicative of a newborn: thin with rounded fin apexes, the study noted. In addition, other researchers have suggested this location off the coast of central California is a birthing ground for great white sharks. Gauna and Sternes also noted in the study that mature sharks were spotted in the same area on the same day and the day before the footage was captured. \"In my opinion, this one was likely hours, maybe one day old at most,\" Sternes said. Gavin Naylor, director of the Florida Program for Shark Research at the University of Florida and a curator at the Florida Museum of Natural History, said it is possible the sighting was a newborn great white shark, but added that the finding is \"highly speculative.\" \"White sharks typically have between 8 and 12 pups at a time, so where are all the others,\" Naylor, who wasn't involved in the study, said via email. Nicholas Ray, a researcher at Nottingham Trent University in the UK, who has studied great white shark population dynamics in South Africa, called the sighting documented by Gauna and Sternes \"fantastic.\" \"This observation is hugely significant and is at the start of scientists' understanding of the elusive reproductive cycles of this endangered species. It could unlock the door as a new discovery and reinforce the need for greater protection in these areas,\" said Ray, who wasn't involved with this study, in an email. That the shark pup was filmed so close to the coast could be significant because its age means it was likely born in shallow waters. Other shark experts believe great whites are born farther out at sea, according to the news release. \"It has been hypothesized by other researchers that white sharks are born in shallow, coastal waters in this region, but never observed,\" said Greg Skomal, senior fisheries scientist at the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries and author of the book \"Chasing Shadows: My Life Tracking the Great White Shark.\" \"While the presence of this young white shark in this area supports this hypothesis, the actual birth was not observed. We cannot rule out that the shark, which is quite mobile, could have moved a great distance from the birthing area. Regardless, this is a very exciting observation.\" The observations require \"further investigation and additional evidence for support or refutation,\" according to the study. \"Nevertheless, in either case, the use of the aerial drone has provided shark science with another interesting set of information,\" the study authors added.

                    "content": "Special events are permitted at Florida State Parks. In general, parks offer picnic shelters on a first-come, first-served basis. However, some picnic shelters may be reserved. Fishing locations are abundant in Florida's state parks. Check the individual park's webpage for specific information. Resource protection is foremost at all state parks, and swimming with manatees is not allowed. However, the endangered Florida manatee can be seen every day at Ellie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park. Visitors can go below the water’s surface to view these gentle giants from the underwater observatory in Homosassa's main spring. Launching and/or landing a drone is prohibited within Florida State Parks except in very rare circumstances. The portion of the Florida Administrative Code that governs the operation of Florida State Parks (Chapter 62D-2.014, F.A.C.) states: The Florida Park Service includes drones in the category of \"other aerial apparatus.” Currently, we do not have guest-accessible landing facilities in any Florida state park. The primary reason for our very limited occasions of drone use (i.e., mainly as a tool for rescue or reviewing areas impacted by natural disaster) is because our mission as part of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection requires us to take into consideration the preservation of natural resources. It has been observed that nesting birds view drones as potential predators and are likely to abandon nests or avoid otherwise ideal habitat areas if drones have been regularly spotted in those locations. We do not want this to occur within our park conservation areas, which are intended to be sanctuaries for our native wildlife. Our statewide park rules, based on regulations set out by the Florida Administrative Code, state that metal detecting is prohibited on all state park lands, except for coastal parks. In these parks, metal detecting may occur within certain beach areas located between the toe of the dune and the high-water line, as designated by the park manager. Metal detecting in submerged locations is not permitted. Objects with historic association (anything over 50 years old) are not permitted to be kept by park visitors, even if the objects are found in the areas approved for metal detecting. These objects are archaeological artifacts, and title to such is vested in the Florida Department of State's Division of Historical Resources. If you plan to visit a state park with a beach, we recommend calling ahead to the park to inquire if there is any section of the beach where you can do metal detecting and if there are any restrictions you should be aware of (i.e., can you dig down to retrieve any objects you find, etc.). View our list of all state parks with beaches. Be aware that a limited number of these parks are inland, and their \"beach\" is on a lake, river, spring, etc. Because these are not coastal parks, metal detecting is not allowed at these locations. Metal detectors may be used to recover personal items that are specifically identified by their owner as being lost in a specific area of a park. The owner of lost property or their representative should contact the park manager who will arrange a time for the search to be conducted in the presence of a park staff member. During these searches, only the item sought may be kept by the owner or their representative. Per Chapter 62.D, F.A.C., no person shall destroy, injure, deface, mar, move, dig, harmfully disturb or remove from any park area, or the waters thereof, any buildings, structures, facilities, historic ruins, equipment, park property, soil, sand, gravel, rocks, stones, minerals, marine plants or animals, artifacts or other materials. No person shall cut, carve, injure, mutilate, move, displace or break off any water bottom formation or growth. Nor shall any person possess, break off or in any way damage any stalactites, stalagmites or other cave formations. This rule means that one cannot gather firewood/kindling materials; forage for edibles; or remove plant/animal items such as driftwood, leaves/pine needles, feathers/bones or other animal products within a state park. Exceptions to this rule are made only for research/academic study purposes, in cases where a collection permit has been issued by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The other exception to the prohibition regarding collection and removal of items is if the items are empty seashells, sea glass or shark teeth found between the water line and toe of the sand dunes in coastal parks with beaches. Seashells with living creatures in them and live sand dollars should be left where they are and not removed. Electric-assist bicycles/e-bikes are defined in Florida Statute as bicycles. They are therefore permitted for use on Florida state trails and on trails designated as multi-use or specifically intended for bicycles within Florida's state parks. If a trail is designated for pedestrians or equestrians only, you may not ride a bicycle or e-bike on that trail. There may be posted speed limits on any given trail. Bicycles and e-bikes may also be used on paved public access roads within Florida's state parks. Motorized recreational scooters are not permitted for use on state trails. Within Florida State Parks, you may ride your e-scooter on paved public access roads but not on sidewalks, boardwalks or trails. Golf carts and utility vehicles may be driven on public access roads within Florida State Parks that have a speed limit of less than 30 mph. All golf cart/utility vehicle operators must: Golf carts/utility vehicles may not be driven on sidewalks, boardwalks, trails, off-road, or on service roads off-limits to park guests. Florida's state parks do not offer any trails or off-road areas for use by ATVs and similarly purposed vehicles, although we do offer trails designed for hiking on foot, mountain biking and horseback riding. Utility vehicles that meet standards also applicable for golf carts may be driven on public access roads within Florida State Parks that have a speed of less than 30 mph.

Coral reefs are some of the most diverse ecosystems in the world. Coral polyps, the animals primarily responsible for building reefs, can take many forms: large reef building colonies, graceful flowing fans, and even small, solitary organisms. Thousands of species of corals have been discovered; some live in warm, shallow, tropical seas and others in the cold, dark depths of the ocean. School in great numbers at Rapture Reef, French Frigate Shoals, Papahānaumokuākea National Marine Monument (Image credit: James Watt) Because of the diversity of life found in the habitats created by corals, reefs are often called the \"rainforests of the sea.\" About 25% of the ocean's fish depend on healthy coral reefs. Fishes and other organisms shelter, find food, reproduce, and rear their young in the many nooks and crannies formed by corals. The Northwest Hawaiian Island coral reefs, which are part of the Papahānaumokuākea National Marine Monument, provide an example of the diversity of life associated with shallow-water reef ecosystems. This area supports more than 7,000 species of fishes, invertebrates, plants, sea turtles, birds, and marine mammals. Deep water reefs or mounds are less well known, but also support a wide array of sea life in a comparatively barren world. In the early days of undersea research at NOAA, scientists needed to surface regularly when SCUBA diving to study coral reefs and other habitats. This slowed down their progress, making it difficult to conduct longer studies. All that changed with the introduction of the HYDROLAB. Shallow water, reef-building corals have a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic algae called zooxanthellae, which live in their tissues. The coral provides a protected environment and the compounds zooxanthellae need for photosynthesis. In return, the algae produce carbohydrates that the coral uses for food, as well as oxygen. The algae also help the coral remove waste. Since both partners benefit from association, this type of symbiosis is called mutualism. Deep-sea corals live in much deeper or colder oceanic waters and lack zooxanthellae. Unlike their shallow water relatives, which rely heavily on photosynthesis to produce food, deep sea corals take in plankton and organic matter for much of their energy needs. Coral reefs protect coastlines from storms and erosion, provide jobs for local communities, and offer opportunities for recreation. They are also are a source of food and new medicines. Over half a billion people depend on reefs for food, income, and protection. Fishing, diving, and snorkeling on and near reefs add hundreds of millions of dollars to local businesses. The net economic value of the world’s coral reefs is estimated to be nearly tens of billions offsite link of U.S. dollars per year. These ecosystems are culturally important to indigenous people around the world. Unfortunately, coral reef ecosystems are severely threatened. Some threats are natural, such as diseases, predators, and storms. Other threats are caused by people, including pollution, sedimentation, unsustainable fishing practices, and climate change, which is raising ocean temperatures and causing ocean acidification. Many of these threats can stress corals, leading to coral bleaching and possible death, while others cause physical damage to these delicate ecosystems. During the 2014-2017 coral bleaching event, unusually warm waters (partially associated with a strong El Niño) affected 70% of coral reef ecosystems worldwide. Some areas were hit particularly hard, like the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, where hundreds of miles of coral were bleached. Corals are able to recover from bleaching events if conditions improve before they die, though it can take many years for the ecosystems to fully heal. Scientists are also testing new ways to help coral reef ecosystems, such as growing coral in a nursery and then transplanting it to damaged areas. A tropical paradise in the Pacific — National Marine Sanctuary of American Samoa — offers a unique opportunity for researchers to observe ocean and coral reef ecosystems that are largely considered to be remote, yet still experience pressure from humans. Educators can use the resources in this collection to teach students about the science and beauty of corals. They can use these organisms and ecosystems to teach many scientific concepts including symbiotic relationships, reproduction strategies, food webs, chemistry, biotic and abiotic interactions, human impacts, and more. Additionally, educators can use corals to teach about conservation and stewardship of the environment. Even if you don't live near a reef, students can learn that they can help protect coral reefs in the United States and around the world. There are many actions, small and large, that everyone can take to help conserve coral reefs. ... [Content truncated]",

No matter where you are, the ocean and Great Lakes are in your hands. We hope these images inspire you to help care for our ocean and to spread the word that Earth isn't green – it's blue. Submit your own photos and join us on: Is #SharkSaturday a thing? Because we think it's a fin-tastic idea! Happy Halloweekend! 🎃 Just like how you dress up for this spooky day, octopuses have the ability to put on a different disguise by changing shape, color, texture, and size. They can mimic other creatures, blend in among the rocks and corals, or even cover themselves in sand or shells. Tell us what costume you are wearing this year! When is it possible to have too many muscles? When they are invasive species! Zebra and quagga mussels have infiltrated freshwater environments like NOAA Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary. These bothersome bivalves disrupt natural food webs, compete with other species for resources, cause damage to underwater structures like buoys and docks, and degrade historic sites like shipwrecks. It’s likely that the mussels were introduced to the Great Lakes by ocean vessels dumping ballast water. When visiting, do your part to protect sanctuary waters from invasive species and don’t be shellfish! It's Mangrove Monday! Mature red, white, and black mangrove trees line over 1800 miles of shoreline in Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. These unique trees can prevent erosion with their intricate root system by absorbing wave action. Their prop and drop roots don't just protect the coast, they are also home to several coastal species. In fact, many reef fish spend the earliest part of their lives in the safety of the mangroves before moving out onto the reefs. Photos: Olivia Williamson Indigenous peoples have been relying on and stewarding ocean areas for millennia. Today, national marine sanctuaries work closely with Native American tribes and nations to protect our natural heritage. In this image, members of the Chumash community journey from the California mainland to Limuw, or Santa Cruz Island. Paddlers, or pullers, voyage using a tomol, a traditionally-built redwood plank canoe. It has a six-person crew, and unique abalone inlay designs. Along their way, the pullers travel through NOAA Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary. They are supported by the sanctuary’s Research Vessel Shearwater, which sets course, hosts resting paddlers, and helps protect the tomol and its pullers from vessel traffic. Preserving and collaborating with indigenous cultures is a critical part of our mission: celebrating the great variety of human connections to the sea can help us all become better stewards of our ocean resources. It's a bird... it's a plane... it's a FLOOF! Well, it's actually a bird. This white, fluffy chick, known as a red-footed booby, can be found in NOAA National Marine Sanctuary of American Samoa.

While this may appear to be one organism, it is actually comprised of many zooids directly connected to each other by tissue. The interaction between the individual zooids is so strong that, together, they assume the function of a single, larger organism! This is just one example of the fascinating creatures that inhabit NOAA Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary! Hiding from Monday?
