                    "content": "Hurricane Shark and Street Shark are nicknames for several claimed instances of a live shark swimming in a flooded urban area, typically in the aftermath of a hurricane. For more than a decade (starting with Hurricane Irene in 2011), all media purporting to document such claims—most notably an image of a shark swimming on a flooded freeway—were debunked as fabrications. However, during Hurricane Ian in 2022, the Associated Press verified a video taken by Dominic Cameratta of a shark or other large fish swimming in flooded Fort Myers, Florida; one consulted expert concluded that the fish was \"a juvenile shark\" while another was unable to determine whether it was a shark.[1] Both the re-emergence of the hoax in hurricane after hurricane and the eventual appearance of a plausible claim have been the subject of commentary and amusement; Daniel Victor of The New York Times described the Associated Press's findings as \"like discovering Bigfoot is real\".[2] The original \"Hurricane Shark\" image was created during Hurricane Irene in 2011, with a claim that the shark was on a street in Puerto Rico.[2] According to The Washington Post, it likely originated on Reddit.[3] In the aftermath of the hurricane, the image was aired by Miami Fox affiliate WSVN,[3] was posted by the Miami Herald, and was widely shared on social media websites including Twitter.[4] The image was debunked by the Post,[3] Snopes.com,[5] and the Toronto Star.[4] It had been created by combining an image of a flooded street in Puerto Rico with a photo of a shark taken by Thomas P. Peschak off of South Africa in 2003.[4] The Post compared it to similar hoax images, such as one supposedly of Osama bin Laden's body following his death.[3] Craig Silverman, writing in the Star, cast it as part of a larger phenomenon of hoax images appearing in the aftermath of significant events.[4] The image has frequently resurfaced on the internet with claims that it was taken during various flooding events,[2] including in Houston during both the 2015 Texas–Oklahoma flood and tornado outbreak and the 2017 floods caused by Hurricane Harvey, and in Daytona Beach, Florida, in 2016 during floods caused by Hurricane Matthew.[5] Peschak has said his fans notify him each time the image re-emerges, but that \"they're more outraged than I am\".[6] After Toronto's Union Station flooded in June 2012, a manipulated image circulated purporting to show two sharks at the base of an escalator bank. The image was later reused in a hoax claiming that a shark tank had burst at the Kuwait Scientific Center.[7][8] While the flooding in Toronto was not the result of a hurricane, the hoax has often been compared to the main Hurricane Shark hoax.[2][9] Later in 2012, after Hurricane Sandy struck New Jersey, other fake shark images circulated in addition to the better-known freeway one. One image appears to depict a shark outside of a home in a suburban area.[10][11] Another appears to show a shark swimming down a suburban street.[12][13] Tom Phillips and Alexis Madrigal found the real shark image used to create the former; Snopes did the same for the latter.[10][13][11] During both Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Florence, fake television breaking news screen captures were seen online saying that the hurricane \"now contains sharks\", although neither contained images of sharks.[14] No, Hurricane Florence does not contain sharks September 13, 2018[15] Hurricane sharks as hoaxes have taken on a life of their own, in social media and in the press. Doctored photos of sharks swimming in urban areas went viral on social media in virtually every disastrous storm and hurricane in the decade since, often copies of the image that first circulated during Irene.[15] Some on social media have treated the Hurricane Shark as a meme, an in-joke hoax to be revived with each disaster, while others have genuinely believed in the authenticity of the photos being spread.[2] Commentators have made comparisons to Sharknado, a film series that also involves sharks caught up in natural disasters.[16][1] In response to the \"now contains sharks\" images circulated during Hurricane Florence, FEMA's Associate Director of Office of Response and Recovery, Jeffrey Byard, denied that \"there's a sharknado effect or anything like that\".[14] Because of the recurring nature of the meme, fact-checkers and journalists in the media have repeatedly needed to clarify that the images of Hurricane sharks were hoaxes. According to Daniel Victor, writing for The New York Times in 2022, Hurricane Shark is the \"longtime nemesis\" of fact-checkers on social media.[2] In Silverman's Verification Handbook, Phillips makes a case study of his work with Madrigal during Hurricane Sandy, describing the images they reviewed as \"strange enough to make you suspicious, yet [not] implausible enough to dismiss out of hand\".[10][13] Rose Eveleth, in a 2014 piece for BBC Future about how to spot fake Sandy photos, includes as her list's final item, \"If it has a shark in it, it's probably fake\".[9] An early claim of sharks in a flooded urban area, predating the original Hurricane Shark hoax, occurred in Goodna, Queensland, Australia, amidst major flooding in January 2011.[4] Butcher Steve Bateman reported a shark, roughly 6 feet (1.8 m) in length, swimming past his shop, and several others reported seeing a shark on a different street.[17] Two local politicians vouched for Bateman's credibility, and The Queensland Times noted that sharks are known to swim up the Bremer River to Goodna.[18] In September 2022, after Hurricane Ian struck Florida, a video emerged online of a shark in a flooded backyard in Fort Myers, Florida, drawing over 12 million views within a day.[1] Initially, the video received skepticism from journalists and fact-checkers, wary of the long history of similar media being hoaxes while also noting that the video seemed more authentic than previous renditions.[2] On September 29, the Associated Press, while noting the history of the Hurricane Shark, confirmed the authenticity of the video based on analysis of the video's metadata and an interview with the videographer, Dominic Cameratta. The Associated Press consulted shark experts George H. Burgess and ... [Content truncated]",

                    "content": "clockThis article was published more than 1 year ago\nFor years, there has been a deluge of fake videos and memes after major storms that claim to show sharks swimming in flooded streets. So when a video purporting to show a shark in an inundated backyard in Fort Myers, Fla., surfaced during Hurricane Ian this week, gathering millions of views on Twitter, viewers were skeptical.\nBut this time, the recording was real — even if there is no confirmation yet that what it depicted was a shark, according to Storyful, which first authenticated the video, and the Associated Press. The news agencies interviewed Dominic Cameratta, a real estate agent who filmed it with his cellphone, and reviewed the clip’s metadata to confirm it was recorded this week.\nThe video shows a fish that looks to be 4 feet long, with sharp dorsal fins, flipping and flopping in the water. “I didn’t know what it was,” Cameratta said. “I zoomed in, and all my friends were like, ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nExperts interviewed by the AP voiced mixed opinions on whether it was indeed a shark. George Burgess, a former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark program, said the fish appears to be a juvenile shark. But Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami’s shark conservation program, said it was difficult to tell what it was.\nWhat’s been happening with animals in Florida during Hurricane Ian?\nImages purportedly showing sharks in urban areas after hurricanes and major floods have been repeatedly debunked since at least 2011, according to Snopes, a fact-checking website.\nOne image of a shark swimming along a flooded highway was uploaded after Hurricane Irene hit Puerto Rico in August 2011. The same image has been widely recirculated after subsequent storms in different areas: In 2016, it was in Daytona Beach, Fla.; a year later, in Houston; and in 2018, it was in Wrightsville Beach, N.C.\nSnopes reported that the original image from 2011 also was a hoax. It incorporated a 2005 photograph of a kayaker being trailed by a great white shark.\nHurricane Ian has devastated Florida, killing at least 23 people, according to state officials. It made its second landfall in the United States on Friday, hitting coastal South Carolina as a Category 1 storm with lashing rains and strong winds.",

Rain is pouring hard and fast—more than eight inches in just an hour, turning river water brown with mud. Earthworms wiggle up to the ground as the soil becomes too wet for them. A flood might be coming. Just about any place on Earth can experience flooding. When so much rain falls that the ground can’t absorb it or waterways can’t hold it, the overflowing water becomes a destructive force. In the United States, flooding causes more death and damage than tornadoes, hurricanes, or lightning. During a rainstorm, precipitation—or the water that comes from rain or snow—goes to different places. Some of it flows into streams, lakes, or city water systems. Other precipitation evaporates and returns to the atmosphere. But much of the rainwater is absorbed by soil. It flows through the top layer of the ground, to plant roots below the surface. This helps provides plants with the water and nutrients they need to grow. The excess water moves deeper into the ground through layers of dirt and rocks where until it becomes part of natural underground wells called groundwater. A habitat can naturally absorb a healthy amount of rainfall it needs to thrive. But too much rain can cause lake and river levels to rise and overflow their banks, or the soil to become too wet to absorb more water. And though you might think extremely dry habitats would welcome too much rain, it turns out that the parched dirt can’t absorb the rain fast enough to capture it all. Severe coastal storms, quickly melting ice and snow, and collapsed barriers (like concrete dams) can also cause floods. Even damaged beaver dams can lead to an overflow of water that the surrounding earth can’t absorb. Floods can form slowly over several days or overwhelm an area with little warning. How quickly a flood forms often depends on the habitat. Slow-forming river flooding happens in regions called floodplains. These are large, flat areas of land along waterways with very shallow banks. When big storms hit, the water overflows the banks and spreads out across the plains. This type of flooding isn’t always bad. It brings nutrients to the surrounding soil, making it fertile for growing crops. That’s why many people live in or near floodplains. But too much water can destroy crops and damage homes. Rushing water can disrupt ecosystems by moving aquatic plants and animals to other habitats. And if flooding is so severe that it flows into local water treatment facilities, experts must monitor the incoming water to make sure the water is safe. Another type of flooding is called a flash flood, when a flood happens within six hours of a heavy rainfall—as much as eight inches an hour. With no place to go, the moving water will tear through highways, valleys, and canyons, washing away vehicles, roads, bridges, and houses. Quickly melting ice and snow can also cause flash flooding, especially when mountain snowmelt overflows the waterways below. On coastlines, hurricane rains cause water levels to rise, and the high winds push that water onto land. Called a storm surge, this also causes flash flooding. Scientists believe that warming temperatures caused by climate change are increasing the risk of floods all over the world, especially in coastal and low-lying areas. Warmer water changes the patterns of ocean currents, which changes global weather patterns. This means that some places will receive more rainfall than the ground can absorb. Other places will get less rain so the land will be drier—and unable to handle rainfall when it does occur. Scientists think that climate change could also cause stronger hurricanes, with more rain and higher winds causing bigger storm surges. A warmer climate could also mean more snowmelt overwhelming the soil; melting polar ice could cause sea levels to rise and increase flooding. (Find out how you can help slow climate change.) Experts might issue a flash flood watch if weather conditions are right. It doesn’t mean flooding will happen but that meteorologists want people to be prepared. When experts are sure a flash flood is on the way, they issue a warning so people can evacuate immediately. Here’s how to keep you and your family safe. Before a flood• Know your neighborhood. Research how close you are to streams, drainage channels, canyons, and any other low-lying areas that might flood.• Keep emergency contact phone numbers in one place so you can get in touch with family members.• Put together an evacuation plan and share it with everyone in your household. Know what paths and routes you can use to quickly get to a high, dry place.• Conduct flood drills to practice evacuating quickly.• Maintain an emergency kit with a three-day supply of food and water. Experts recommend canned or dried foods that don't need to be cooked, and at least one gallon of water per day for each person and pet. During a flood• Never wait for orders to leave; if you think a flood might be coming, evacuate immediately.• If flooding hasn’t started, move important items to upper floors of your house.• If flooding has already started where you are, move to the highest place you can find, like a roof of a house or car. Bring as much food, water, and sheltering blankets as possible.• Never walk through flood water, especially if it’s moving. Hazardous chemicals, sewage, and even wild animals are often in floodwater, and just six inches of moving water can knock you off your feet.• If you must walk through water to escape, walk where the water is still. Never touch electrical equipment if you are standing in water, or even if you’re wet.• If water is quickly rising while you’re in your car, leave your vehicle and move to higher ground, like a hill or bridge. After a flood• If you’ve evacuated your house, return only after you’re given the all-clear from officials.• If you stayed put, check ... [Content truncated]",

                    "content": "Man films fish ‘flopping around’ in neighbour’s garden but experts are split over identification\nPhotos and videos of sharks and other marine life swimming in suburban floodwaters make for popular hoaxes during heavy storms. But a mobile phone video filmed during Hurricane Ian’s assault on south-west Florida isn’t just another fishy story.\nThe video, which showed a large, dark fish with distinct dorsal fins thrashing around an inundated Fort Myers back yard, racked up more than 12m views on Twitter within a day, as users responded with disbelief and comparisons to the “Sharknado” film series.\nDominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer, confirmed he filmed the clip from his patio on Wednesday morning when he saw something “flopping around” in his neighbour’s flooded yard.\n“I didn’t know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,” he said. “I zoomed in, and all my friends are like: ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nHe guessed the fish was about 1.2 metres (4ft) long.\nExperts were divided over whether the clip showed a shark or another large fish. George Burgess, the former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark programme, said in an email that it “appears to be a juvenile shark”, while Dr Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami’s shark conservation programme, wrote that “it’s pretty hard to tell”.\nNevertheless, some Twitter users dubbed the hapless fish the “street shark”.\nCameratta said the flooding had only just begun when the video was taken, but that the waters were “all the way up to our house” by the time the Associated Press reached him by phone on Wednesday evening.\nHe said the fish may have made its way up from nearby Hendry Creek into a retention pond, which then overflowed, spilling the creature into his neighbour’s back yard. A visual analysis of nearby property confirmed it matches the physical landmarks in the video.\nLeslie Guelcher, a professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, was among the online sleuths who initially thought the video was fake.\n“Don’t think this is real. According to the index on the video it was created in June 2010. Someone else posted it at 10am as in Fort Myers, but the storm surge wasn’t like that at 10am,” she tweeted on Wednesday.\nGuelcher acknowledged later, though, that online tools she and others were using to establish the video’s origins didn’t actually show when the video itself was created, merely when the social media profile of the user was created.\nThe AP confirmed through the original clip’s metadata that it was captured on Wednesday morning.\n“It makes a bit more sense from a flooding standpoint,” Guelcher said by email, when informed the fish was spotted near an overflowing pond. “But how on earth would a shark go from the Gulf of Mexico to a retention pond?”\nYannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, said most sharks leave shallow bays ahead of hurricanes, possibly tipped off to their arrival by a change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he said, or been washed into it.\n“Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters – rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments – and often appear in similar videos in Florida water bodies connected to the sea, such as coastal canals and ponds,” Burgess said. “Assuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.”\nCameratta sent the video to a group chat on WhatsApp on Wednesday morning, according to his friend John Paul Murray, who sent the AP a timestamped screenshot.",
