                "content": "Florida officials have warned that alligators, snakes and bears may emerge during Hurricane Ian, the storm currently wreaking havoc on the Florida coast.\nIan is looking to be one of the worst hurricanes the state has ever seen. It is expected to make landfall Wednesday and is classed as a Category 4 storm, with winds between 130 to 156 miles per hour. Category 4 hurricanes can cause severe and catastrophic damage.\nThe storm has already caused flooding in areas across the Key West, with others likely to be hit. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) said in a statement that major storms such as Hurricane Ian can cause wildlife to become more active.\n\"You may be more likely to see alligators, snakes and bears, so remember to stay alert and give them space,\" the commission said.\nWildlife can become disoriented during hurricanes due to severe weather conditions. This means they could turn up in strange places, away from their natural habitat.\nFlorida is home to 1.3 million alligators. Although they rarely attack humans, they can become aggressive if stressed or provoked. The severe weather conditions may mean the animals pose more of a threat to humans than usual.\nAlligators usually live in the state's wetlands and swamps. If these become overflooded due to the storm, it is likely they will relocate to unusual areas. In its statement, the FWC told residents to call officials if they come across a nuisance alligator—alligators that display threatening behavior.\nSix venomous snake species call Florida their home, including the eastern coral snake, the southern copperhead, the cottonmouth, and three types of rattlesnakes. Two species of bears are also found in Florida: the American black bear and the Florida black bear.\nSevere weather can affect all sorts of other wildlife, such as sharks.\nOcean research organization Ocearch, which tracks great white sharks swimming off the coast of America, said on Facebook that many of their tagged sharks are currently in Atlantic Canada, where tropical storm Fiona is raging. At least one person has died in the storm, which is one of the most severe that the country has seen.\nThis chart, provided by Statista, shows the number of recorded hurricanes making landfall in the continental United States since 1851, by strength.\n\"Our team is still watching the Shark Tracker to see what their next moves are, but we are pleasantly surprised by a few of our sharks pinging in right after the Hurricane hit, one even pinging during it,\" an Ocearch spokesperson told Newsweek.\nAlthough the sharks will pose very little danger to humans during this time, the organization will continue to track the sharks' movements over the next few days to see whether any become displaced.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nRobyn White is a Newsweek Nature Reporter based in London, UK.

In December 2021, the most destructive winter tornado outbreak, known as the Quad-State Tornado Outbreak, caused 89 fatalities, 672 injuries, and at least $3.9 billion in property damages. Scientists at the University of Miami’s Cooperative Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) and NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) investigated this outbreak and found that it occurred under an exceptionally strong and prolonged negative Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern, which created favorable conditions for tornado outbreaks. July 2, 2024 Tropical Cyclone Freddy breaks records as the longest-lasting cyclone on record. Spanning 36 days, it traveled from the Australia to Africa, nearly 33% of the Earth’s circumference. July 1, 2024 A new study spanning two decades of research may indicate a series of reefs from the surface to 150 meters deep in the Gulf of Mexico are more resilient to warmer oceans as they are exposed to a wider range of temperatures brought on by a physical movement of seawater called “eddies.” June 27, 2024 In May 2024, representatives from the Hurricane Modeling Team at NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) hosted a Summer Colloquium focused on equipping the next generation of hurricane scientists with a knowledge base of the HAFS model. June 4, 2024 With an active hurricane season on the horizon, the need for reliable hurricane forecasting is at the forefront of our minds. Heightened sea surface temperatures, weakened vertical wind shear, and an enhanced West African monsoon are expected to contribute to the development of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic. To predict these developing storms, meteorologists employ models that rely on current observations and mathematical calculations to predict a storm’s behavior and track. These models are complex and utilize inputs from a variety of sources including historic, numeric, oceanic, and atmospheric data to generate their predictions. May 8, 2024 Blue lights fill the room. The faint smell of salt emanates throughout the space as wires and tubes intricately suspended over robotic arms move along custom-built tracks over four rows of tanks filled with seawater – and fragments of critically-endangered corals. In the Experimental Reef Lab, scientists at NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) and the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) are investigating how crucial reef-building coral species are affected by the impacts of climate change using a suite of open-source robotic arms designed and built at AOML.

                "content": "Photos and videos of sharks and other marine life swimming in suburban floodwaters make for popular hoaxes during massive storms. But a cellphone video filmed during Hurricane Ian’s assault on southwest Florida isn’t just another fish story.\nThe eye-popping video, which showed a large, dark fish with sharp dorsal fins thrashing around an inundated Fort Myers backyard, racked up more than 12 million views on Twitter within a day, as users responded with disbelief and comparisons to the “Sharknado” film series.\nDominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer, confirmed he filmed the clip from his back patio Wednesday morning when he saw something “flopping around” in his neighbor’s flooded yard.\n“I didn’t know what it was — it just looked like a fish or something,” he told The Associated Press. “I zoomed in, and all my friends are like, ‘It’s like a shark, man!’ ”\nHe guessed the fish was about 4 feet in length.\nA shark has been spotted in the streets of Fort Myers. Stay safe, Florida.  pic.twitter.com/7s8slr7Lnr\nExperts were of mixed opinion on whether the clip showed a shark or another large fish. George Burgess, former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark program, said in an email that it “appears to be a juvenile shark,” while Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, director of the University of Miami’s shark conservation program, wrote that “it’s pretty hard to tell.”\nNevertheless, some Twitter users dubbed the hapless fish the “street shark.”\nThe surge worsened in Fort Myers as the day went on. Cameratta said the flooding had only just begun when the clip was taken, but that the waters were “all the way up to our house” by the time the AP reached him by phone Wednesday evening.\nHe said the fish may have made its way up from nearby Hendry Creek into a retention pond, which then overflowed, spilling the creature into his neighbor’s backyard. A visual analysis of nearby property confirmed it matches the physical landmarks in the video.\nLeslie Guelcher, a professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, was among the online sleuths who initially thought the video was fake.\n“Don’t think this is real. According to the index on the video it was created in June 2010. Someone else posted it at 10 AM as in Fort Myers, but the storm surge wasn’t like that at 10 AM,” she tweeted Wednesday.\nGuelcher acknowledged later, though, that online tools she and others were using to establish the video’s origins didn’t actually show when the video itself was created, merely when the social media profile of the user was created.\nThe AP confirmed through the original clip’s metadata that it was captured Wednesday morning.\n“It makes a bit more sense from a flooding standpoint,” she said by email, when informed the fish was spotted near an overflowing pond. “But how on earth would a shark go from the Gulf of Mexico to a retention pond?”\nYannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, said that most sharks flee shallow bays ahead of hurricanes, possibly tipped off to their arrival by a change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he said, or been washed into it.\n“Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters — rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments — and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,” Burgess said. “Assuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.”\nCameratta sent the video to a group chat on WhatsApp on Wednesday morning, according to his friend John Paul Murray, who sent the AP a timestamped screenshot.\n“Amazing content,” Murray wrote in reply.\nSign up for the Fortune Features email list so you don’t miss our biggest features, exclusive interviews, and investigations.\n© 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

        "Question": "Has the local wildlife or environmental department in Florida issued any statements regarding the presence of a shark on the flooded highway during Hurricane Ian?",
        "Answer": "Based on this evidence, it can be inferred that while the FWC did not specifically mention a shark swimming on the flooded highway during Hurricane Ian, their warning about wildlife becoming more active during major storms indirectly implies the possibility of marine animals like sharks being displaced. Therefore, it is likely that the local wildlife or environmental department in Florida did not issue a specific statement regarding the presence of a shark on the flooded highway during Hurricane Ian.",
