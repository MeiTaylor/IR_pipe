                    "content": "Florida officials have warned that alligators, snakes and bears may emerge during Hurricane Ian, the storm currently wreaking havoc on the Florida coast.\nIan is looking to be one of the worst hurricanes the state has ever seen. It is expected to make landfall Wednesday and is classed as a Category 4 storm, with winds between 130 to 156 miles per hour. Category 4 hurricanes can cause severe and catastrophic damage.\nThe storm has already caused flooding in areas across the Key West, with others likely to be hit. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) said in a statement that major storms such as Hurricane Ian can cause wildlife to become more active.\n\"You may be more likely to see alligators, snakes and bears, so remember to stay alert and give them space,\" the commission said.\nWildlife can become disoriented during hurricanes due to severe weather conditions. This means they could turn up in strange places, away from their natural habitat.\nFlorida is home to 1.3 million alligators. Although they rarely attack humans, they can become aggressive if stressed or provoked. The severe weather conditions may mean the animals pose more of a threat to humans than usual.\nAlligators usually live in the state's wetlands and swamps. If these become overflooded due to the storm, it is likely they will relocate to unusual areas. In its statement, the FWC told residents to call officials if they come across a nuisance alligator\u2014alligators that display threatening behavior.\nSix venomous snake species call Florida their home, including the eastern coral snake, the southern copperhead, the cottonmouth, and three types of rattlesnakes. Two species of bears are also found in Florida: the American black bear and the Florida black bear.\nSevere weather can affect all sorts of other wildlife, such as sharks.\nOcean research organization Ocearch, which tracks great white sharks swimming off the coast of America, said on Facebook that many of their tagged sharks are currently in Atlantic Canada, where tropical storm Fiona is raging. At least one person has died in the storm, which is one of the most severe that the country has seen.\nThis chart, provided by Statista, shows the number of recorded hurricanes making landfall in the continental United States since 1851, by strength.\n\"Our team is still watching the Shark Tracker to see what their next moves are, but we are pleasantly surprised by a few of our sharks pinging in right after the Hurricane hit, one even pinging during it,\" an Ocearch spokesperson told Newsweek.\nAlthough the sharks will pose very little danger to humans during this time, the organization will continue to track the sharks' movements over the next few days to see whether any become displaced.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.\nRobyn White is a Newsweek Nature Reporter based in London, UK.

                    "content": "People living on Sanibel and Captiva weren\u2019t the only ones driven from their homes by Hurricane Ian\u2019s churning storm surge. Wildlife, amphibians and birds were displaced. Some species have come back fine, others are struggling to survive while others yet remain missing-in-action. Saltwater from the Gulf of Mexico inundated Sanibel\u2019s fresh-water system turning it brackish. Many animals and amphibians don\u2019t tolerate salt, said Chris Lechowicz, director of wildlife and habitat management for Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Association. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a few years before we really get an idea of how everything did,\u201d he said. \u201cJust because something survived immediately after the hurricane does not mean that it is going to be here a year later.\u201d Sanibel only had one heavy rain after Hurricane Ian before going into the dry season and the current rainy season has been anything but rainy. Lechowicz was hoping heavy rainfall would wash away the brackish water. \u201cThe outlook of some of these species is still unknown, most of the areas on the island are still pretty brackish,\u201d he said. Impounded lakes, those dug for home communities and have nowhere to flow to, were flourishing with freshwater fish, snakes, turtles and other amphibians, but are highly brackish now and the fish are gone, Lechowicz said. \u201cWe have a lot of residents who are asking us when it will become fresh again and that\u2019s a big unknown,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it dries up, the salt still stays there. \u201cIt might not be how it was for a very long time. It will take lots of rainfall, flooding that way, getting some of that water out to getting it to change. It\u2019s not an overnight fix.\u201d Lechowicz returned to Sanibel four days after the storm, to silence. The first thing he saw were iguanas, lots of them. \u201cIt was like they were waiting for this their whole lives,\u201d he said, \u201cThey took over the island.\u201d The second thing he saw were coyotes. Larger animals like coyotes and bobcats did OK, he said. Much of the vegetation where alligators hide died after the hurricane, so alligators became visible. They also went hunting for food because the fish, snakes and turtles died in the brackish water. \u201cAlligators didn\u2019t have a lot of food sources for a while,\u201d Lechowicz said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s going now, but a lot of the vegetation has grown back so people aren\u2019t seeing as many as they were right after the hurricane.\u201d The first survey after the storm, in October, found fewer birds, but that was to be expected, said Audrey Albrecht, shorebird biologist for the conservation association. \u201cThat didn\u2019t mean the birds were dead, it just means they went somewhere else,\u201d she said. Survey numbers were back to normal by December, she said. The 10 eagle nests the conversancy monitored were destroyed but nine pairs of eagles rebuilt nests, she said. Some of the small fish, like mosquito fish, have been spotted and Lechowicz is confident they will bounce back. He\u2019s not as confident about the game fish like bluegill, sun fish and large-mouth bass. They were brought to the island in the 1960s so people would have freshwater fish to catch. \u201cWe have not seen any of these game fish since the hurricane,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible that we may have lost them.\u201d The conservation association did a gopher tortoise survey in January and found a 30 percent loss on four properties and almost a 100 percent loss on another. The property with no active burrows was near the beach, Lechowicz said. He said some of the tortoises probably drowned when they got trapped in their burrows. He expects the number of burrows will go up when they do the survey again in October. \u201cBox turtles did amazing,\u201d he said. Storm surge swept away the contents of condos along the beach, but the box turtle, living near the condos survived. \u201cThe condos are gone, and the turtles didn\u2019t move,\u201d he said. \u201cThey dug the front half of their shells into the sand and just held on.\u201d All the turtles that the conservation association tagged with radios are accounted for, he said. One box turtle did go for a ride. It was found in the Cape Coral canal system a month after the hurricane, he said. The conservation association lists six species as missing, two frog species, pig frog and green tree; two mammals, the Virginia opossum and nine-banded armadillo; one snake, the Florida brown snake and one native lizard, the ground skink. Lechowicz thinks the green frog survived, but he hasn\u2019t been able to verify it yet. The pig frog is the equivalent of a Southern bull frog. They aren\u2019t native to Sanibel. \u201cThose are a freshwater frog; they don\u2019t take to saltwater very well. We haven\u2019t heard one of those since,\u201d he said. The missing opossums are a mystery, Lechowicz said, because they are like raccoons, which survived the storm. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure why because they could have gone up in the trees like raccoons did. So, we don\u2019t have an explanation on why we haven\u2019t seen them yet,\u201d he said. The missing armadillos dig burrows and storm surge probably filled up the burrows and they drowned, he said. Lechowicz thinks the Florida brown snake will show up in the next year. It\u2019s an animal you don\u2019t go looking for because they are hard to find. The ground skink is the rarest lizard on the island, he said. He hasn\u2019t seen one since the storm. WGCU is your trusted source for news and information in Southwest Florida.

Rain is pouring hard and fast\u2014more than eight inches in just an hour, turning river water brown with mud. Earthworms wiggle up to the ground as the soil becomes too wet for them. A flood might be coming. Just about any place on Earth can experience flooding. When so much rain falls that the ground can\u2019t absorb it or waterways can\u2019t hold it, the overflowing water becomes a destructive force. In the United States, flooding causes more death and damage than tornadoes, hurricanes, or lightning. During a rainstorm, precipitation\u2014or the water that comes from rain or snow\u2014goes to different places. Some of it flows into streams, lakes, or city water systems. Other precipitation evaporates and returns to the atmosphere. But much of the rainwater is absorbed by soil. It flows through the top layer of the ground, to plant roots below the surface. This helps provides plants with the water and nutrients they need to grow. The excess water moves deeper into the ground through layers of dirt and rocks where until it becomes part of natural underground wells called groundwater. A habitat can naturally absorb a healthy amount of rainfall it needs to thrive. But too much rain can cause lake and river levels to rise and overflow their banks, or the soil to become too wet to absorb more water. And though you might think extremely dry habitats would welcome too much rain, it turns out that the parched dirt can\u2019t absorb the rain fast enough to capture it all. Severe coastal storms, quickly melting ice and snow, and collapsed barriers (like concrete dams) can also cause floods. Even damaged beaver dams can lead to an overflow of water that the surrounding earth can\u2019t absorb. Floods can form slowly over several days or overwhelm an area with little warning. How quickly a flood forms often depends on the habitat. Slow-forming river flooding happens in regions called floodplains. These are large, flat areas of land along waterways with very shallow banks. When big storms hit, the water overflows the banks and spreads out across the plains. This type of flooding isn\u2019t always bad. It brings nutrients to the surrounding soil, making it fertile for growing crops. That\u2019s why many people live in or near floodplains. But too much water can destroy crops and damage homes. Rushing water can disrupt ecosystems by moving aquatic plants and animals to other habitats. And if flooding is so severe that it flows into local water treatment facilities, experts must monitor the incoming water to make sure the water is safe. Another type of flooding is called a flash flood, when a flood happens within six hours of a heavy rainfall\u2014as much as eight inches an hour. With no place to go, the moving water will tear through highways, valleys, and canyons, washing away vehicles, roads, bridges, and houses. Quickly melting ice and snow can also cause flash flooding, especially when mountain snowmelt overflows the waterways below. On coastlines, hurricane rains cause water levels to rise, and the high winds push that water onto land. Called a storm surge, this also causes flash flooding. Scientists believe that warming temperatures caused by climate change are increasing the risk of floods all over the world, especially in coastal and low-lying areas. Warmer water changes the patterns of ocean currents, which changes global weather patterns. This means that some places will receive more rainfall than the ground can absorb. Other places will get less rain so the land will be drier\u2014and unable to handle rainfall when it does occur. Scientists think that climate change could also cause stronger hurricanes, with more rain and higher winds causing bigger storm surges. A warmer climate could also mean more snowmelt overwhelming the soil; melting polar ice could cause sea levels to rise and increase flooding. (Find out how you can help slow climate change.) Experts might issue a flash flood watch if weather conditions are right. It doesn\u2019t mean flooding will happen but that meteorologists want people to be prepared. When experts are sure a flash flood is on the way, they issue a warning so people can evacuate immediately. Here\u2019s how to keep you and your family safe. Before a flood\u2022 Know your neighborhood. Research how close you are to streams, drainage channels, canyons, and any other low-lying areas that might flood.\u2022 Keep emergency contact phone numbers in one place so you can get in touch with family members.\u2022 Put together an evacuation plan and share it with everyone in your household. Know what paths and routes you can use to quickly get to a high, dry place.\u2022 Conduct flood drills to practice evacuating quickly.\u2022 Maintain an emergency kit with a three-day supply of food and water. Experts recommend canned or dried foods that don't need to be cooked, and at least one gallon of water per day for each person and pet. During a flood\u2022 Never wait for orders to leave; if you think a flood might be coming, evacuate immediately.\u2022 If flooding hasn\u2019t started, move important items to upper floors of your house.\u2022 If flooding has already started where you are, move to the highest place you can find, like a roof of a house or car. Bring as much food, water, and sheltering blankets as possible.\u2022 Never walk through flood water, especially if it\u2019s moving. Hazardous chemicals, sewage, and even wild animals are often in floodwater, and just six inches of moving water can knock you off your feet.\u2022 If you must walk through water to escape, walk where the water is still. Never touch electrical equipment if you are standing in water, or even if you\u2019re wet.\u2022 If water is quickly rising while you\u2019re in your car, leave your vehicle and move to higher ground, like a hill or bridge. After a flood\u2022 If you\u2019ve evacuated your house, return only after you\u2019re given the all-clear from officials.\u2022 If you stayed put, check ... [Content truncated]",
