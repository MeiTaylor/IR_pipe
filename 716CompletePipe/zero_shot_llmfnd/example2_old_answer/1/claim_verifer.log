Now she is considering giving the chicken to her three dogs before it goes bad as a huge power blackout caused by the storm extends beyond two days and everything in her freezer thaws amid scorching temperatures. The government has not said what percentage of the population remains without electricity, but electrical authorities said only 10% of Havana's 2 million people had power Thursday. “We are not having a very good time, trying to survive, to keep things from thawing,” said Garrido, who lives with her mother and a 19-year-old daughter in the town of Cojimar on the outskirts of Havana. Hundreds of thousands of Cubans are facing similar situations. Ian crossed western Cuba on Tuesday before heading north to Florida. It initially knocked out power to a few provinces, but problems compounded and soon the power grid collapsed nationwide, affecting 11 million people, the first time a total blackout has happened in living memory. The storm also left three people dead and caused still unquantified damage. Electricity returned in some parts of Cuba on Wednesday, while it came on then shut off again in other parts. Experts said the total blackout showed the vulnerability of Cuba's power grid and warned that it will require time and sources - things the country doesn't have - to fix the problem. Authorities have promised to work without rest to address the issue. A half-dozen Havana residents interviewed by The Associated Press on Thursday were tense because of the lack of electricity, which has also left them without water since electric motors power the pumps that bring water to their taps. Many homes can't cook because they use electric stoves following a campaign by authorities to eliminate artisanal stoves. “We have never been so long without electricity,” Garrido said. “They put it at 24 hours, at 36, but it's already been more than 48. It's criminal. Who is responsible for this?” She has placed bottles of frozen water that had been in the freezer next to the chicken, along with some pork and sausages, to try to preserve the meat longer. A fan and television also await the return of electricity. Calls by AP to a dozen people in Cuba's main cities - Holguin, Guantanamo, Matanzas, Ciego de Avila, Camaguey and Santiago - found similar problems to Havana, with most reporting their neighborhoods were still without electricity. Authorities say the total blackout happened because of a failure in the connections between Cuba's three regions - west, center and eas - caused by Ian's winds. Cuba's power grid “was already in a critical and immuno-compromised state as a result of the deterioration of the thermoelectric plants. The patient is now on life support,” said Jorge Pinon, director of the Center for International Energy and Environmental Policy's Latin America and Caribbean Latin America and Caribbean program at the University of Texas. Being interconnected “is the perfect analogy for the domino effect in which you knock down a domino and hit all the others in a chain reaction,” he said, referring to how a fault in one part of the country soon affected all of it. Cuba is suffering an economic crisis, produced by a combination of U.S. sanctions, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and inefficiencies. The island's GDP plummeted 11% in 2020 and grew 1.3% in 2021. Cubans were already living with scheduled power blackouts. Cuba has 13 power generation plants, eight of which are traditional thermoelectric plants, and five floating power plants rented from Turkey since 2019. There is also a group of small plants distributed throughout the country since an energy reform in 2006. But the plants are poorly maintained, a phenomenon the government attributed to the lack of funds and U.S. sanctions. Complications in obtaining fuel is also a problem. “Unfortunately, it will be a long recovery process that will also have to cover the generation deficit that already existed before the hurricane, all this at a high economic cost that the country cannot afford,” Pinon said.

Viewer discretion is advised.\n“This is certainly a sad, sad day and a sad time, for not just the folks in Plum but all the folks in the community and in this region,” said Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald.\nOf the three people taken to hospitals, two were released while one remained in critical condition, said Steve Imbarlina, deputy director of fire and emergency services for Allegheny County. Fifty-seven firefighters were treated at the scene for minor issues.\nThe Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office is expected to provide additional information about the deceased victims.\n“Please give us some time to deal with this situation and give the families your respect and give them some space to deal with this tragedy,” Conley said.\nEmergency responders reported people trapped under debris after the blast leveled one house and left two others engulfed in flames, county spokesperson Amie Downs said. Crews from at least 18 fire departments worked to douse the flames with the help of water tankers from Allegheny and Westmoreland counties.\nThe cause of the explosion is under investigation by the county fire marshal’s office along with borough and county law enforcement. Imbarlina warned that the investigation would be a “slow and long process” that would include a lot of forensic testing and could last “months if not years.”\nMichael Huwar, president of Peoples Gas, said the company’s checks for gas leaks underground and in the air as well as the consistent pressure verified at regulation stations indicates that “our system was operating as designed.”\nGas and electric service was shut off as a precaution, and officials said Sunday a plan was in place to begin restoring service with electric power expected to be returned to all but a few residences, officials said.\nGov.

Rain is pouring hard and fast—more than eight inches in just an hour, turning river water brown with mud. Earthworms wiggle up to the ground as the soil becomes too wet for them. A flood might be coming. Just about any place on Earth can experience flooding. When so much rain falls that the ground can’t absorb it or waterways can’t hold it, the overflowing water becomes a destructive force. In the United States, flooding causes more death and damage than tornadoes, hurricanes, or lightning. During a rainstorm, precipitation—or the water that comes from rain or snow—goes to different places. Some of it flows into streams, lakes, or city water systems. Other precipitation evaporates and returns to the atmosphere. But much of the rainwater is absorbed by soil. It flows through the top layer of the ground, to plant roots below the surface. This helps provides plants with the water and nutrients they need to grow. The excess water moves deeper into the ground through layers of dirt and rocks where until it becomes part of natural underground wells called groundwater. A habitat can naturally absorb a healthy amount of rainfall it needs to thrive. But too much rain can cause lake and river levels to rise and overflow their banks, or the soil to become too wet to absorb more water. And though you might think extremely dry habitats would welcome too much rain, it turns out that the parched dirt can’t absorb the rain fast enough to capture it all. Severe coastal storms, quickly melting ice and snow, and collapsed barriers (like concrete dams) can also cause floods. Even damaged beaver dams can lead to an overflow of water that the surrounding earth can’t absorb. Floods can form slowly over several days or overwhelm an area with little warning. How quickly a flood forms often depends on the habitat. Slow-forming river flooding happens in regions called floodplains. These are large, flat areas of land along waterways with very shallow banks. When big storms hit, the water overflows the banks and spreads out across the plains. This type of flooding isn’t always bad. It brings nutrients to the surrounding soil, making it fertile for growing crops. That’s why many people live in or near floodplains. But too much water can destroy crops and damage homes. Rushing water can disrupt ecosystems by moving aquatic plants and animals to other habitats. And if flooding is so severe that it flows into local water treatment facilities, experts must monitor the incoming water to make sure the water is safe. Another type of flooding is called a flash flood, when a flood happens within six hours of a heavy rainfall—as much as eight inches an hour. With no place to go, the moving water will tear through highways, valleys, and canyons, washing away vehicles, roads, bridges, and houses. Quickly melting ice and snow can also cause flash flooding, especially when mountain snowmelt overflows the waterways below. On coastlines, hurricane rains cause water levels to rise, and the high winds push that water onto land. Called a storm surge, this also causes flash flooding. Scientists believe that warming temperatures caused by climate change are increasing the risk of floods all over the world, especially in coastal and low-lying areas. Warmer water changes the patterns of ocean currents, which changes global weather patterns. This means that some places will receive more rainfall than the ground can absorb. Other places will get less rain so the land will be drier—and unable to handle rainfall when it does occur. Scientists think that climate change could also cause stronger hurricanes, with more rain and higher winds causing bigger storm surges. A warmer climate could also mean more snowmelt overwhelming the soil; melting polar ice could cause sea levels to rise and increase flooding. (Find out how you can help slow climate change.) Experts might issue a flash flood watch if weather conditions are right. It doesn’t mean flooding will happen but that meteorologists want people to be prepared. When experts are sure a flash flood is on the way, they issue a warning so people can evacuate immediately. Here’s how to keep you and your family safe. Before a flood• Know your neighborhood. Research how close you are to streams, drainage channels, canyons, and any other low-lying areas that might flood.• Keep emergency contact phone numbers in one place so you can get in touch with family members.• Put together an evacuation plan and share it with everyone in your household. Know what paths and routes you can use to quickly get to a high, dry place.• Conduct flood drills to practice evacuating quickly.• Maintain an emergency kit with a three-day supply of food and water. Experts recommend canned or dried foods that don't need to be cooked, and at least one gallon of water per day for each person and pet. During a flood• Never wait for orders to leave; if you think a flood might be coming, evacuate immediately.• If flooding hasn’t started, move important items to upper floors of your house.• If flooding has already started where you are, move to the highest place you can find, like a roof of a house or car. Bring as much food, water, and sheltering blankets as possible.• Never walk through flood water, especially if it’s moving. Hazardous chemicals, sewage, and even wild animals are often in floodwater, and just six inches of moving water can knock you off your feet.• If you must walk through water to escape, walk where the water is still. Never touch electrical equipment if you are standing in water, or even if you’re wet.• If water is quickly rising while you’re in your car, leave your vehicle and move to higher ground, like a hill or bridge. After a flood• If you’ve evacuated your house, return only after you’re given the all-clear from officials.• If you stayed put, check ...

But a mobile phone video filmed during Hurricane Ian’s assault on south-west Florida isn’t just another fishy story.\nThe video, which showed a large, dark fish with distinct dorsal fins thrashing around an inundated Fort Myers back yard, racked up more than 12m views on Twitter within a day, as users responded with disbelief and comparisons to the “Sharknado” film series.\nDominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer, confirmed he filmed the clip from his patio on Wednesday morning when he saw something “flopping around” in his neighbour’s flooded yard.\n“I didn’t know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,” he said. “I zoomed in, and all my friends are like: ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nHe guessed the fish was about 1.2 metres (4ft) long.\nExperts were divided over whether the clip showed a shark or another large fish. George Burgess, the former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark programme, said in an email that it “appears to be a juvenile shark”, while Dr Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami’s shark conservation programme, wrote that “it’s pretty hard to tell”.\nNevertheless, some Twitter users dubbed the hapless fish the “street shark”.\nCameratta said the flooding had only just begun when the video was taken, but that the waters were “all the way up to our house” by the time the Associated Press reached him by phone on Wednesday evening.\nHe said the fish may have made its way up from nearby Hendry Creek into a retention pond, which then overflowed, spilling the creature into his neighbour’s back yard. A visual analysis of nearby property confirmed it matches the physical landmarks in the video.\nLeslie Guelcher, a professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, was among the online sleuths who initially thought the video was fake.\n“Don’t think this is real. According to the index on the video it was created in June 2010. Someone else posted it at 10am as in Fort Myers, but the storm surge wasn’t like that at 10am,” she tweeted on Wednesday.\nGuelcher acknowledged later, though, that online tools she and others were using to establish the video’s origins didn’t actually show when the video itself was created, merely when the social media profile of the user was created.\nThe AP confirmed through the original clip’s metadata that it was captured on Wednesday morning.\n“It makes a bit more sense from a flooding standpoint,” Guelcher said by email, when informed the fish was spotted near an overflowing pond. “But how on earth would a shark go from the Gulf of Mexico to a retention pond?”\nYannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, said most sharks leave shallow bays ahead of hurricanes, possibly tipped off to their arrival by a change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he said, or been washed into it.\n“Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters – rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments – and often appear in similar videos in Florida water bodies connected to the sea, such as coastal canals and ponds,” Burgess said. “Assuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.”\nCameratta sent the video to a group chat on WhatsApp on Wednesday morning, according to his friend John Paul Murray, who sent the AP a timestamped screenshot.', 'content_num': 787}, 'website_quality_evaluation': {'website_quality Score': 8, 'justification': 'The Guardian is a well-respected international news organization with a reputation for investigative reporting and editorial independence.
