                    "content": "Hurricane Shark and Street Shark are nicknames for several claimed instances of a live shark swimming in a flooded urban area, typically in the aftermath of a hurricane. For more than a decade (starting with Hurricane Irene in 2011), all media purporting to document such claims—most notably an image of a shark swimming on a flooded freeway—were debunked as fabrications. However, during Hurricane Ian in 2022, the Associated Press verified a video taken by Dominic Cameratta of a shark or other large fish swimming in flooded Fort Myers, Florida; one consulted expert concluded that the fish was \"a juvenile shark\" while another was unable to determine whether it was a shark.[1] Both the re-emergence of the hoax in hurricane after hurricane and the eventual appearance of a plausible claim have been the subject of commentary and amusement; Daniel Victor of The New York Times described the Associated Press's findings as \"like discovering Bigfoot is real\".[2] The original \"Hurricane Shark\" image was created during Hurricane Irene in 2011, with a claim that the shark was on a street in Puerto Rico.[2] According to The Washington Post, it likely originated on Reddit.[3] In the aftermath of the hurricane, the image was aired by Miami Fox affiliate WSVN,[3] was posted by the Miami Herald, and was widely shared on social media websites including Twitter.[4] The image was debunked by the Post,[3] Snopes.com,[5] and the Toronto Star.[4] It had been created by combining an image of a flooded street in Puerto Rico with a photo of a shark taken by Thomas P. Peschak off of South Africa in 2003.[4] The Post compared it to similar hoax images, such as one supposedly of Osama bin Laden's body following his death.[3] Craig Silverman, writing in the Star, cast it as part of a larger phenomenon of hoax images appearing in the aftermath of significant events.[4] The image has frequently resurfaced on the internet with claims that it was taken during various flooding events,[2] including in Houston during both the 2015 Texas–Oklahoma flood and tornado outbreak and the 2017 floods caused by Hurricane Harvey, and in Daytona Beach, Florida, in 2016 during floods caused by Hurricane Matthew.[5] Peschak has said his fans notify him each time the image re-emerges, but that \"they're more outraged than I am\".[6] After Toronto's Union Station flooded in June 2012, a manipulated image circulated purporting to show two sharks at the base of an escalator bank. The image was later reused in a hoax claiming that a shark tank had burst at the Kuwait Scientific Center.[7][8] While the flooding in Toronto was not the result of a hurricane, the hoax has often been compared to the main Hurricane Shark hoax.[2][9] Later in 2012, after Hurricane Sandy struck New Jersey, other fake shark images circulated in addition to the better-known freeway one. One image appears to depict a shark outside of a home in a suburban area.[10][11] Another appears to show a shark swimming down a suburban street.[12][13] Tom Phillips and Alexis Madrigal found the real shark image used to create the former; Snopes did the same for the latter.[10][13][11] During both Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Florence, fake television breaking news screen captures were seen online saying that the hurricane \"now contains sharks\", although neither contained images of sharks.[14] No, Hurricane Florence does not contain sharks September 13, 2018[15] Hurricane sharks as hoaxes have taken on a life of their own, in social media and in the press. Doctored photos of sharks swimming in urban areas went viral on social media in virtually every disastrous storm and hurricane in the decade since, often copies of the image that first circulated during Irene.[15] Some on social media have treated the Hurricane Shark as a meme, an in-joke hoax to be revived with each disaster, while others have genuinely believed in the authenticity of the photos being spread.[2] Commentators have made comparisons to Sharknado, a film series that also involves sharks caught up in natural disasters.[16][1] In response to the \"now contains sharks\" images circulated during Hurricane Florence, FEMA's Associate Director of Office of Response and Recovery, Jeffrey Byard, denied that \"there's a sharknado effect or anything like that\".[14] Because of the recurring nature of the meme, fact-checkers and journalists in the media have repeatedly needed to clarify that the images of Hurricane sharks were hoaxes. According to Daniel Victor, writing for The New York Times in 2022, Hurricane Shark is the \"longtime nemesis\" of fact-checkers on social media.[2] In Silverman's Verification Handbook, Phillips makes a case study of his work with Madrigal during Hurricane Sandy, describing the images they reviewed as \"strange enough to make you suspicious, yet [not] implausible enough to dismiss out of hand\".[10][13] Rose Eveleth, in a 2014 piece for BBC Future about how to spot fake Sandy photos, includes as her list's final item, \"If it has a shark in it, it's probably fake\".[9] An early claim of sharks in a flooded urban area, predating the original Hurricane Shark hoax, occurred in Goodna, Queensland, Australia, amidst major flooding in January 2011.[4] Butcher Steve Bateman reported a shark, roughly 6 feet (1.8 m) in length, swimming past his shop, and several others reported seeing a shark on a different street.[17] Two local politicians vouched for Bateman's credibility, and The Queensland Times noted that sharks are known to swim up the Bremer River to Goodna.[18] In September 2022, after Hurricane Ian struck Florida, a video emerged online of a shark in a flooded backyard in Fort Myers, Florida, drawing over 12 million views within a day.[1] Initially, the video received skepticism from journalists and fact-checkers, wary of the long history of similar media being hoaxes while also noting that the video seemed more authentic than previous renditions.[2] On September 29, the Associated Press, while noting the history of the Hurricane Shark, confirmed the authenticity of the video based on analysis of the video's metadata and an interview with the videographer, Dominic Cameratta. The Associated Press consulted shark experts George H. Burgess and ... [Content truncated]",

                    "content": "clockThis article was published more than 1 year ago\nFor years, there has been a deluge of fake videos and memes after major storms that claim to show sharks swimming in flooded streets. So when a video purporting to show a shark in an inundated backyard in Fort Myers, Fla., surfaced during Hurricane Ian this week, gathering millions of views on Twitter, viewers were skeptical.\nBut this time, the recording was real — even if there is no confirmation yet that what it depicted was a shark, according to Storyful, which first authenticated the video, and the Associated Press. The news agencies interviewed Dominic Cameratta, a real estate agent who filmed it with his cellphone, and reviewed the clip’s metadata to confirm it was recorded this week.\nThe video shows a fish that looks to be 4 feet long, with sharp dorsal fins, flipping and flopping in the water. “I didn’t know what it was,” Cameratta said. “I zoomed in, and all my friends were like, ‘It’s like a shark, man!’”\nExperts interviewed by the AP voiced mixed opinions on whether it was indeed a shark. George Burgess, a former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark program, said the fish appears to be a juvenile shark. But Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami’s shark conservation program, said it was difficult to tell what it was.\nWhat’s been happening with animals in Florida during Hurricane Ian?\nImages purportedly showing sharks in urban areas after hurricanes and major floods have been repeatedly debunked since at least 2011, according to Snopes, a fact-checking website.\nOne image of a shark swimming along a flooded highway was uploaded after Hurricane Irene hit Puerto Rico in August 2011. The same image has been widely recirculated after subsequent storms in different areas: In 2016, it was in Daytona Beach, Fla.; a year later, in Houston; and in 2018, it was in Wrightsville Beach, N.C.\nSnopes reported that the original image from 2011 also was a hoax. It incorporated a 2005 photograph of a kayaker being trailed by a great white shark.\nHurricane Ian has devastated Florida, killing at least 23 people, according to state officials. It made its second landfall in the United States on Friday, hitting coastal South Carolina as a Category 1 storm with lashing rains and strong winds.",

But an A.P. analysis and experts say a wayward finned creature was indeed captured on video swimming on a street in Fort Myers, Fla., this week.\nBy Daniel Victor\nTo professional fact-checkers who sort fact from fable on social media, Hurricane Shark has been a longtime nemesis.\nFor more than a decade, fake, grainy images of a shark swimming in waters it doesn’t belong in — usually a highway and a subway platform — have reliably circulated during nearly every major storm.\nIt was never real. Yet it kept coming up, shared without skepticism yet again, and the checkers of facts were forced to defeat it again, over and over.\nSo you can imagine their hesitant surprise when a new video emerged on Wednesday appearing to show a shark in a backyard near Fort Myers, Fla., which had been battered by Hurricane Ian and was beginning to flood. Though this video didn’t have the telltale signs of fakery that previous versions did, skepticism was warranted as it racked up millions of views on Twitter.\nThen evidence began emerging that it might actually be real. And on Thursday, both Storyful, a news agency, and The Associated Press confirmed its authenticity with interviews and examinations of the original clip’s metadata, nailing down a story reporters thought they would never write.\nIt was like discovering Bigfoot is real.\n“After over half a decade of debunking this hoax every time there was a flood or hurricane, I can’t believe I’m looking at an honest-to-god street shark,” wrote Jane Lytvynenko, a freelance reporter. “Good to finally meet you, pal.”\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The fake image first surfaced in 2011 and originally claimed to show a street in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Irene hit.\nAccording to Snopes.com:\nSince then the same image has been recirculated several times over, typically localized to some big city in the United States that has just experienced a hurricane or other weather event producing heavy rains and floods. Its last iteration assigned it to Houston after heavy rains pounded portions of Texas over Memorial Day weekend in 2015. \nRead more at http://www.snopes.com/photos/animals/puertorico.asp#hc1IJVTKlvXqJwOM.99\nThe Snopes article deconstructs the image, showing how the shark was taken from a 2005 photograph of a kayaker in a tropical setting and photoshopped into a photo of a flooded street.\nThis is not the first Facebook hoax to spread virally across newsfeeds this year, and not even the first shark-related hoax to hit our area.\nEarlier this year, a photo of a swarm of sharks claiming to originate from the Garden City area was debunked after reaching hundreds of thousands of people.\nIf it looks or sounds unbelievable, it just may be.

But a new video of a shark in Hurricane Ian's storm surge has people thinking it is the real deal. Hurricane Ian slammed into Florida on Wednesday as a Category 4 hurricane with winds just a few miles per hour away from bumping the classification up to a Category 5. The hurricane resulted in a massive storm surge, and that surge appeared to have pushed a shark into a flooded street in Fort Myers, Florida. While some Twitter users tried to take credit for the video or said they got the video from a friend, the Associated Press has confirmed the video was authentic after speaking with the person who filmed the shark struggling to swim in his backyard. According to the AP report, Dominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer who said he filmed the video Wednesday morning, filmed the shark from his back patio when he saw it flopping around in his neighbor's backyard. Cameratta said at first, he thought the animal was a large fish but soon realized it was a shark. He estimated the shark to be 4 feet long. Cameratta lives near a retention pond, and he said he assumed the shark made it up Hendry Creek and into the pond. The pond then overflowed from storm surge and heavy rain, transporting the shark into the flooded backyard. Some experts told AP they thought the shark looked to be a juvenile. Twitter user THE Alex shared the video at approximately 10 a.m. on Wednesday. The video shows what appears to be a shark flopping around in an apparently flooded street. The animal in the video is seen thrashing its tail back and forth as winds gust in the background. \"My buddy just sent me a video of this shark swimming down his back yard in Fort Myers,\" THE Alex tweeted Wednesday. My buddy just sent me a video of this this shark swimming down his back yard in Fort Myers 😂#hurricane #Ian #HurricaneIan pic.twitter.com/kLon2z3F8Q Leslie Guelcher, an assistant professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University who goes by Dr. G on Twitter, was one of the people who questioned the video's authenticity. Prior to AP's verification, Guelcher tweeted that the video index showed a creation date of June 2010. She later told Newsweek she misread the index data, but she is unconvinced the video is real because the video was taken before the storm surge rose in earnest in Fort Myers. \"I'm still not convinced it is accurate although the person who commented provided the name of who filmed it and where,\" Guelcher said. \"However, a reverse image search on Google, limiting to site:Twitter.com shows a number of posts with at least one being from before the storm surge hit.\" She later said she could see how a shark could go from the Gulf of Mexico into a retention pond. However, some experts expect the shark may have sensed a drop in barometric pressure signifying the approaching hurricane. It may have attempted to flee shallow waters to somewhere safer. However, the shark could have accidentally entered the creek and then the pond in its attempts to flee, or flooding could have forced the animal into the residential area. The video's confirmation was the culmination of five years of searching for Jane Lytvynenko, a freelance reporter who has spent years debunking hoaxes. Before the video was confirmed as real, Lytvynenko implied it had credibility. \"I can't believe I'm looking at an honest-to-god street shark,\" Lytvynenko tweeted. \"Good to finally meet you, pal.\" After over half a decade of debunking this hoax every time there was a flood or hurricane, I can't believe I'm looking at an honest-to-god street shark.Good to finally meet you, pal. https://t.co/hwMWX4Peqo Shark hoaxes have emerged in many hurricanes since a fake image of a shark swimming through a flooded highway was first posted in 2012. Social media agency Storyful also verified the video was authentic but couldn't confirm if the footage showed a small shark or a different fish, such as a cobia. Florida officials warned residents that some wildlife might emerge during the storm, namely bears, alligators and snakes, as wildlife becomes more active and disoriented during massive storms. Newsweek reached out to Florida Fish and Wildlife for comment. Update 9/30/2022 11:15 a.m. ET: This story has been updated with additional information.

However, the video is indeed authentic, but whether it shows a small shark or another type of fish, such as a cobia or an armored catfish, has not yet been determined.\nThe source, Dominic Cameratta, told Storyful he captured the video on Wednesday morning at his house in Devonwood as he watched floodwaters filling up his neighbor’s property. Storyful geolocated the video and confirmed it was filmed at his property. The metadata on the footage indicated it was filmed at 8:04 am.\nMORE ON IAN: \nWhen are the theme parks in Florida opening again?

A spokesperson for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said its staff were \"unable to identify the animal.\" \nRick Bartleson, a marine scientist at the Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation (SCCF), was also uncertain but, based on the shape of its dorsal fin, said he was doubtful that it was a shark or sawfish.\nAll the news you need to know, every day\nBy clicking Sign Up, I confirmthat I have read and agreeto the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.\n\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2024 FOX Television Stations",

He claimed the photo was taken on I-75 outside of Naples.

Later, someone asked if he knew where the photo actually originated. Mopage19 made it clear that he was just trolling. Photo shop — Maury Page (@mopage19) September 10, 2017 The shark in this photograph is indeed real, but the shark swimming through a flooded highway is fake. The shark was initially captured by renowned National Geographic photographer Thomas P. Peschak off the coast of South Africa over 10 years ago. On his website, Peschak explains that he was working with the White Shark Trust for more than 10 months to capture images of white sharks in South Africa that would help depict the current scientific research. Great white shark following a scientist in a kayak off South Africa’s coast. This photograph is on the cover of my latest book ‘Sharks and People’ published by University of Chicago Press. #sharks, #greatwhite, #kayak, #kayaking, #southafrica, #whitesharktrust A post shared by Thomas Peschak (@thomaspeschak) on Dec 29, 2013 at 6:20am PST The image of the shark stalking a small kayak went viral when Peschak first published it on his website. He claims the photo attracted \"more than 100,000 visitors\" in 24 hours. Given the stunning nature of the image, the photographer says that it garnered its fair share of skeptics claiming the image was altered in some manner. The original image even has its own debunking on Snopes. Peschak maintains the image was not altered in any way, in fact, he told AOL Travel in 2014 that the photo was captured \"on slide film Fuji Provia 100 using a Nikon F5 Camera and 17-35 mm lens.\" On his site, he writes, \"all magazines and prints were taken from a high-resolution scan of the slide with no post-production work.\" This means the original photo never even touched Photoshop, until someone decided to take that shark and put it on a flooded highway. It appears as if the first hoax surrounding the image occurred in April 2006, when the French magazine Le Magazine des Voyages de Peche published a joke article about a fisherman in Australia that accidentally caught a shark in one of its nets. After freeing the shark, affectionately named Cindy, it followed the fisherman around years, scaring away his catch in the process. Two years later, someone turned the April Fools' Day joke into a YouTube slideshow, racking up over 1.6 million views. Here's a another clip with over a half million views that was uploaded in 2013, pushing a similar narrative. We were unable to track down the original YouTube upload. The first known record of the viral image of the shark on a flooded highway that we know today occurred in 2011 when Hurricane Irene hit Puerto Rico, causing flooding across the island. The image of the shark on the highway was picked up by WSVN 7 News out of Miami and credited to a man named Ramon Garganta. The image was quickly debunked, and the sharks origin was even linked to Peschak's shark, but it didn't matter. The damage was done, people fell for the shark swimming on a highway, and have been falling for it ever since. The shark showed up again in 2012, this time it was swimming next to another shark at the bottom of an escalator at the Scientific Center or a mall in Kuwait. The hoaxers claimed that a shark tank collapsed, but it didn't. The photo of the escalators in actually from Union subway station in Toronto, which flooded in June of 2012. Essentially, it was originally a meme that was repurposed by someone into a hoax. Shark tank collapse in a shopping mall in Kuwait . Great photo !! pic.twitter.com/kY5rxwit — Niall Boylan Show (@niallboylan4fm) July 7, 2012 The photo of the shark on the highway surfaced again when Hurricane Sandy wreacked havoc on the northeast. Mashable debunked it back then, along with a slew of other fake photographs. While this hoax and others like it will not be going away anytime soon, there is some hope following the photo's most recent appearances. The media widely debunked the story of the shark on the highway quickly after it went viral on social media, and it was pointed out by many that it was fake. In the age of fake news, always be a little skeptical of things you see, even if there ... [Content truncated]",
