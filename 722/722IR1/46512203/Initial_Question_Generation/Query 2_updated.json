The misleading posts come from a variety of sources and accounts, but generally imply that \"elites\" or government agencies deliberately started the fires. Some of the most popular theories are couched in questions about a \"narrative\" and make claims that alternative views are being \"censored\", despite collecting millions of views. While there are specific rumours circulating about Maui, they fit into a general pattern repeatedly seen after extreme weather events and natural disasters - politically motivated activists seeking to downplay the potential impact of climate change. Videos and images claiming that the wildfires were not a natural disaster - and were instead caused by a \"directed energy weapon\", a \"laser beam\" or explosion - have been viewed millions of times. One video viewed 10 million times claims to show a large explosion in Maui just before the fires. But the video was originally a viral clip shared on TikTok in May showing a transformer explosion in Chile. Chilean TV network Chilevisi\u00f3n ran a report on the viral video, confirming the explosion was the result of a blown transformer caused by strong wind. An image of a church on fire in Hawaii has been viewed 9 million times, with claims it shows a laser beam striking it. But it has been digitally altered. The original image - of the Waiola Church in Lahaina in flames on 8 August - has no laser beam or ray of light visible. Two other false images have been racking up huge numbers of views. One shows a fireball and a bright streak of light rising up towards the night sky. It, too, has been accompanied by claims that wildfires are ... [Content truncated]",

Fox News host Sean Hannity was among those who shared low-resolution video on X, the social media app formerly known as Twitter. Hannity\u2019s post was viewed more than 425,000 times within a few hours, and similar videos posted by others received thousands more views on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok. Higher-resolution from the nonpartisan network C-SPAN shows that Biden looked downward for about 10 seconds while he was seated at a table. In the video, Biden watches someone who\u2019s speaking, coughs, looks downward and then nods in agreement with the speaker. Then he looks up again. He later delivered a speech to the same audience. The higher-resolution video shows that Biden kept his eyes open for most of the time he was looking downward. His open eyes aren\u2019t clearly visible in the lower-quality videos. At least one member of Congress, Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, also shared the lower-resolution version on X. A spokesperson for Nehls said in a statement: \u201cEveryone with eyes can draw their own conclusion about whether President Biden was nodding off in the video.\u201d Asked for comment about the Maui videos, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in an email: \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate they feel the need to lie. Instead, they should join him in supporting the people of Maui.\u201d The posts on the country\u2019s largest social media platforms, which largely appear to be spreading unchecked, are the latest test of how Silicon Valley will handle misinformation in the 2024 election cycle \u2014 and whether it will enforce its own policies. Low-quality videos are an example of what some misinformation researchers call \u201c\u201d: media that can mislead people through simple techniques, ... [Content truncated]",

More than 50 people have been killed, homes and businesses have been wiped out, and nearly 11,000 customers are grappling with power outages. The fires, fanned in part by strong winds from Hurricane Dora, have not yet been contained, and the extent of the damage isn\u2019t fully known. Rebuilding the island will likely take months or even years. CNN Impact Your World has vetted non-profit organizations on the ground providing support. Click here to help. If you\u2019re looking to donate money to help those affected by the wildfires in Hawaii \u2014 or looking to support any charitable cause close to your heart \u2014 it\u2019s important to follow certain steps to ensure your money is going to the right place.

Several sites help people find and support legitimate charities, including Charity Navigator, BBB Wise Giving Alliance, and CharityWatch.

It might be best to research alternatives if the charity\u2019s website does not make clear its mission or who it serves. The US Federal Trade Commission suggests when conducting an online search of any charity, you should add the words \u201ccomplaint,\u201d \u201creview,\u201d \u201cfraud,\u201d or \u201cscam\u201d to the search terms. Doing this should bring up any bad reviews or red flags about the organization. It\u2019s also helpful to know if the group ... [Content truncated]",

The update on the death toll \u2013 up from 99 a day before \u2013 came as authorities said only five of the dead had been identified. County officials released two names and said the three others would be announced after their relatives are notified. Authorities had gone through about a third of the search area as of Tuesday; the county put the figure at 32% while Hawaii Gov. Josh Green told CNN Tuesday it was 27%. With so much still to search, the death toll still could rise significantly, Green has said. \u201cOver the course of the next several weeks, we\u2019ll be able to confirm who passed away. But it\u2019s gonna be very difficult going,\u201d the governor told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on Tuesday. Here's what you can do to help Hawaii Many deaths happened on a highway down by the ocean in western Maui, he said. \u201cI think many of the fatalities that we\u2019ll ultimately discover, a higher percentage will be from there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now that we\u2019re going to the houses, we are not sure what we will see. We\u2019re hopeful and praying that it\u2019s not large, large numbers.\u201d It\u2019s unclear how many people are unaccounted for, in part because of communication gaps, Green said Monday. \u201cA lot of people had to run and left all they had behind. They don\u2019t have their phones \u2013 the phones are incinerated,\u201d he said. A portable morgue unit has arrived in Hawaii and will help authorities identify and process remains with equipment such as examination tables, X-ray units and laboratory equipment, Jonathan Greene, deputy assistant secretary of the US Department of Health ...

The audio, a bit grainy and muffled as if it was recorded from a phone in someone\u2019s pocket, will have the 80-year-old sounding confused, perhaps seeming to forget that he\u2019s president, before turning murderously angry. It may arrive in journalists\u2019 inboxes from an anonymous whistleblower, or just go viral on social media. Or maybe the uproar will be over audio of former President Donald Trump saying something that his supporters find disqualifying. Whether such a clip is real or the work of new, startlingly realistic generative AI models, the affected politician will call it a fake and evidence of the other side\u2019s willingness to lie, cheat and steal their way to the White House. And while generative AI experts say they will most likely be able to detect charlatans, it would be impossible to prove a recording is real. And it\u2019s another question, and a doubtful one at that, whether such evidence of some audio\u2019s provenance will matter to partisan voters so ready to reject any datapoint that doesn\u2019t conform to their worldviews. Deepfake audio, authentic-sounding but false recordings built from short snippets of a subject talking, have become so realistic that they can fool your own mother, presenting painfully obvious potential for underhanded political tactics. AI developers warn that the technology\u2019s rapid development and widespread deployment risks ushering in an epistemological dystopia that would undermine the foundations of representative democracy. \u201cCampaigns are high stakes,\u201d said Hany Farid, a generative AI expert at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cWe know that we have state-sponsored actors interfering, we know the campaigns are going to play dirty tricks.
