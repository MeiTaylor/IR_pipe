Also on Saturday, the greatest threat will be over parts of the Mississippi Valley centered around Memphis, but much of the area from Texas to Kentucky could see severe weather. The threat Sunday is not expected to be as widespread, Hennen said. On Friday, Trump visited Lee County, which suffered the brunt of last weekend\u2019s storms. He toured tornado-affected areas and met with residents and officials, including Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey. \u201cFEMA has been told directly by me to give the A Plus treatment to the Great State of Alabama and the wonderful people who have been so devastated by the Tornadoes,\u201d the President said in a tweet Monday.

One of the tornadoes that ripped through Lee County was upgraded Monday to an EF-4 after meteorologists determined it brought 170 mph winds and left a track almost a mile wide. How you can help the tornado victims The path of destruction from the EF-4 is at least 24 miles long, said Chris Darden, meteorologist in charge at the National Weather Service\u2019s Birmingham office.

The last tornado with such a high toll was an EF-5 storm in Moore, Oklahoma, that killed 24 people in May 2013. Three children \u2013 ages 6, 9 and 10 \u2013 are among those killed in Alabama. The youngest, Armando Hernandez, was remembered as \u201ca precious little man that was loved by everyone,\u201d according to his aunt. Taylor Thornton, a fourth-grade student, was described as inquisitive and a positive influence on those around her. As of noon Monday, there were no more people reported missing, the coroner said, but he said the tallies of dead and missing could rise as search teams make their way into new areas. Crews will be dealing with temperatures in the 30s on Tuesday morning. The path of destruction looks \u201cas if someone had taken a ... [Content truncated]",

President Trump departed from Joint Base Andrews on Friday, on his way to visit communities in Alabama that were devastated by a tornado outbreak.Credit...Sarah Silbiger/The New York Times * March 8, 2019 BEAUREGARD, Ala. \u2014 President Trump offered words of comfort on Friday for Alabama\u2019s tornado survivors, scrawling his presidential signature on some of their Bibles as they moved close to him at a church that provided shelter during the storm and was now doling out emergency aid. \u201cWe saw things you wouldn\u2019t believe,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he stood amid the wreckage and rubble of Beauregard, the site of the nation\u2019s deadliest tornado in six years.

A few hundred people lined the two-lane county road by Providence Baptist Church to try to glimpse Mr. Trump from the grassy shoulder or the nearby cemetery. During his stop at Providence, Mr. Trump met with relatives of the 23 storm victims, as well as volunteers and emergency workers.
