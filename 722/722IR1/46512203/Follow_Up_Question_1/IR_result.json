The Maui Police Department and the FBI have released the list of 31 individuals still unaccounted for following the fires. Yet an Instagram post falsely claims “over 1,000 children are missing.” The wildfires in Maui started on Aug. 8 and burned for days. They consumed more than 2,000 homes and other structures and largely destroyed Lahaina, a historic community that was hit the hardest by the fires. Following weeks of difficult work using DNA and other methods to confirm and identify the victims of the Maui wildfires, officials announced on Sept. 15 that the death toll was 97, a lower figure than previously reported. Dr. Jeremy Stuelpnagel, the Maui medical examiner, said at a press conference that day, “because of the fire, because of the heat, because of the situation of this being a mass disaster, many of them are down to the bones — some are fragmented.” Stuelpnagel also said, “We’re trying every single modality we have to make sure that we identify these people. It does take a lot of time. This is a mass disaster.” The county of Maui has released reports on those still unaccounted for following the fires. As of Sept. 15, 31 individuals were reported missing from an initial list of more than 3,200 people. A list identifying the missing was released by the Maui Police Department and the FBI, with one person identified as a minor. But an online video, titled “Over 1,000 Missing Children in Maui,” falsely claims that 1,050 kids are “gone without a trace.” The video goes on to say, “They have absolutely no clue where these children are.” The numbers given in the video ...

Mr. Trump’s travels through Alabama — in a helicopter for an aerial tour, through a debris-strewn neighborhood and later at the Baptist church that has been a hub of relief efforts — were a welcome presence in Beauregard, where at least one of the storm’s victims had flown a Trump campaign flag outside his home and where Mr. Trump captured most of the vote. A few hundred people lined the two-lane county road by Providence Baptist Church to try to glimpse Mr. Trump from the grassy shoulder or the nearby cemetery. During his stop at Providence, Mr. Trump met with relatives of the 23 storm victims, as well as volunteers and emergency workers. Dressed in his presidency’s iteration of what political strategists sometimes describe as “disaster casual” — a windbreaker, showing a fraction of an open-collar shirt, and khaki pants — he posed for pictures and signed autographs, including at least one in a 12-year-old boy’s Bible. “We couldn’t get here fast enough,” Mr. Trump said ...

        "Question": "What are the sources that confirm the video's true origin and debunk the claim of Trump's Maui visit?",
        "Answer": "The sources that confirm the video's true origin and debunk the claim of Trump's visit to Maui are as follows:\n\n1. **Snopes Fact Check**: According to Snopes, the footage incorrectly attributed to Trump's visit to Maui actually shows him visiting Beauregard, Alabama, in 2019, after a tornado disaster. The video was shared widely on social media after the wildfires in Maui, misleading many into believing it was a recent event. The original footage shows Trump speaking after a different disaster, and not in the context of the August 2023 wildfires in Maui.\n\n2. **USA Today Fact Check**: In a similar analysis, USA Today corroborated that there are no credible reports of Trump's visit to Maui amid the wildfires. The video being circulated was confirmed to be from Trump's 2019 visit to Alabama. They specifically note that the video shows him at a disaster relief center following a tornado, thus providing clear evidence that the footage is old and misrepresented as a recent event relating to Maui.\n\nBased on the evidence from these reputable fact-checking sources, the claim that Donald Trump visited Maui after the August 2023 wildfires is false, and the video in question is from a different event entirely.",
