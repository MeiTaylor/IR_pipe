Rating: ] A that frequently goes viral on social media is often presented as an awkward exchange between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin, betraying a lack of trust between the two. A popular account on X, for example, shared the clip in late 2023 with the caption \"Trust issues\": ! This video was manipulated. The portion appearing to show the two leaders placing their full drinks on the table after toasting is simply a clip of the two picking their glasses up played in reverse. The full shows the action as it occurred, and it ends with both leaders sipping from their drinks after their toast: This meeting occurred in Russia on April 25, 2019, following a breakdown of talks between former U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim over North Korea's nuclear program, with Putin attempting to serve as a mediator, as by The Washington Post: > Russian President Vladimir Putin emerged from his first summit with Kim Jong Un \\ saying that North Korea needs international security guarantees, not just U.S. pledges, to consider giving up its nuclear arsenal. > > Putin’s call for more multinational involvement contrasts sharply with President Trump’s strategy of one-on-one dialogue with the North Korean leader. It also reinforced North Korea’s attempt to link security and sanctions relief as twin demands in negotiations over its nuclear program. Because the video was manipulated to suggest a sequence of events that did not happen, the claim is False. #### Sources ... [Content truncated]",

Twitter / Snopes **Claim:** A video shows North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin toasting each other then placing their drinks on the table without consuming them. **Rating:** ] Rating: False A video of a 2019 meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin is often shared as a way to illustrate \"trust issues.\" The video shows both leaders toast each other and then place their drinks down without sipping. A Jan. 24, 2024 post on X (formerly Twitter), for example, shared the video with \"When no one trust no one\": ! This video was manipulated. The portion appearing to show the two leaders placing their full drinks on the table after toasting is simply a clip of the two picking their glasses up played in reverse. The full shows the action as it occurred, and it ends with both leaders sipping from their drinks after their toast: > This meeting occurred in Russia on April 25, 2019, following a breakdown of talks between former U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim over North Korea's nuclear program, with Putin attempting to serve as a mediator, as by The Washington Post: > Russian President Vladimir Putin emerged from his first summit with Kim Jong Un \\ saying that ...

At their lavish banquet, they drank Russian wines and toasted the embrace of their two pariah states. And before leaving, they swapped guns as gifts - model rifles from each others' munitions lines. The optics of Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin's date in eastern Russia clearly underscore a relationship that is being strengthened in wartime. It isn't over yet, with the North Korean leader spending several days touring shipyards, aircraft factories and other military sites before he returns home. There had been great anticipation in the lead-up - with global media rapt as Kim trundled for hours in his armoured train over the border. He kept the West guessing for nearly 40 hours before reaching the Vostochny Cosmodrome - a space base in a far-flung eastern corner of Russia. Even then, it was unclear what exactly the pair would be meeting to talk about - with White House warnings last week that the North could sell arms to Russia sparking alarm. Putin had sent ahead a welcome party to greet Kim as his train rolled onto the space base's tracks. A red-carpeted, balustrade staircase was also erected mid-air, waiting for the train to pull in and for the North Korean leader to step out. Putin was waiting in front of the centre when Kim drew up in his limousine. There, before flashing cameras, the two leaders shook hands - the pictures beamed out immediately by state media. Both leaders know the power of showmanship, but the Supreme Leader of North Korea, as Kim is known, is particularly a fan of ceremony.

(Pool photo via Getty Images) It’s the logical next step since Putin’s quest for victory in Ukraine has stalled. Emissary harnesses Carnegie’s global scholars to deliver incisive, nuanced analysis on the most pressing international affairs challenges. The Kremlin’s activist foreign policy is expanding Russian global influence at a time when the United States and other Western countries are increasingly divided or consumed by domestic problems. The Return of Global Russia project will examine the Kremlin’s ambitions to become a player in far-flung parts of the world where its influence has long been written off, the tools it is relying upon to challenge the liberal international order, and practical Western policy options for how and when to respond to this new challenge. Twenty-four years ago, in July 2000, newly elected Russian President Vladimir Putin was greeted at the G8 summit in Nago, Japan, with a mixture of excitement and disbelief. On the way there, he stopped in Pyongyang and announced a would-be major breakthrough in arms control: the then-leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Il, had told him that North Korea was not interested in developing its own ballistic missile capability and would be content to use “exclusively” rockets from other countries “for peaceful exploration of space.” A month later, Kim made a mockery of Putin’s claim by announcing that what he had told the Russian leader was a joke. The contrast between Putin then and now couldn’t be more striking. This week, Putin traveled to Pyongyang to embrace a fellow dictator and international outcast, blatantly undermining the efforts of the international community to contain North Korean nuclear ambitions that Russia, as a permanent member of the Security Council, had helped craft and pledged to enforce.
