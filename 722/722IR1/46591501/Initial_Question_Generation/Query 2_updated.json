AILSA CHANG, HOST: Seven time zones east of Moscow today, Russian President Vladimir Putin greeted the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un. Russia had announced Kim was coming for this summit of two authoritarians, but details of the meeting's timing and location were kept secret until Kim's arrival in his armored train after a two-day journey from Pyongyang. NPR's Charles Maynes reports from Moscow that each leader is looking to gain something from the other.CHARLES MAYNES, BYLINE: Kim's state visit came at Putin's invitation. And the setting, once revealed, was clearly designed to impress. North Korea had recently failed to place its own spy satellites into orbit, so Putin chose the venue of Russia's new Vostochny Cosmodrome for the summit, welcoming Kim with a warm handshake and, later, a personal tour.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Non-English language spoken).MAYNES: As Putin looked on, officials from Roscosmos, the Russian space agency told Kim about the latest in Russian space technology. In fact, before Kim's arrival, Putin told reporters Russia would help North Korea's quest to launch a satellite. That's why we're here, said Putin. The North Korean leader showed a big interest in rocket technology. In turn, Kim was full of praise for his host. Speaking through an interpreter in official remarks before the press, Kim fully endorsed Russia's invasion of Ukraine, calling it part of a sacred struggle to defend Russia against Western imperialism. The day ended with a state dinner and remarks from both leaders.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SUPREME LEADER KIM JONG UN: (Speaking Korean).MAYNES: Through an interpreter, Kim toasted Putin's health...(SOUNDBITE OF CHAIRS MOVING)MAYNES: ...And the crowd rose to its feet as Kim called for ...

But underneath the smiles and ceremony of on Thursday lies what analysts say is the real significance of the latest foreign trip by North Korea's young dictator: a stark message to President Donald Trump that talks with the United States are not the only game in town. North Korea has for months been negotiating with the U.S. \u2014 ostensibly toward the goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. Trump left his first meeting with Kim in 2018 saying the pair had a \"special bond.\" However, Kim's last summit with Trump in February . Negotiations between the two sides have since stalled, and it appears they still disagree about what \"denuclearization\" actually means. And meeting Putin is partly Kim's way of signaling to Trump that he \"can shop around for a deal,\" according to Robert Kelly, a professor of international relations at South Korea's Pusan University. \"Trump, as is his wont, has turned the engagement with Kim into an all-encompassing personal psychodrama, and the U.S. public and media drank that Kool-Aid,\" Kelly said. \"Kim Jong Un is now happy to talk to anyone.\" The North Korean dictator's overriding aim may be to protect his family's dynastic rule against regime change, experts believe. But Kim is also keen to ease the international sanctions that are squeezing his country's poor economy. After years of isolation, Kim has appeared more eager to reach out in recent years, partly because he has achieved the ultimate bargaining chip: an intercontinental ballistic missile theoretically capable of carrying out a nuclear strike on the U.S. mainland. This isn't all about Washington. As well as the two meetings with Trump, there have been four summits with Chinese President Xi Jinping and three more . Now, with the ... [Content truncated]",

Putin and Kim shook hands at the Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia\u2019s Amur Region; the North Korean leader got a lift in Putin\u2019s Russian-made Aurus limousine; and Kim raised a toast to his counterpart, promising Russia would punish \u201cevil forces\u201d \u2013 dictator-speak that appeared to endorse Putin\u2019s ghastly, grinding war of attrition against Ukraine. But the two sides held no press conference and issued no communique. No deals were publicly announced. Figuring out the real takeaway from the summit in Russia\u2019s Far East is going to be a challenge, even though the global stakes are quite high. Back in July, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu went to Pyongyang with an apparent shopping list. After a year and a half of high-intensity combat in Ukraine, Russia\u2019s ammunition stocks have been heavily depleted, and US officials warned that North Korea and Russia were mulling potential deals to replenish supplies for Moscow\u2019s war on Ukraine. North Korea has a substantial arsenal on the Korean peninsula.

During a lavish state dinner that featured crab salad, borscht and a chocolate cheesecake festooned with North Korean and Russian flags, both Putin and Kim repeated nearly note-for-note many of the platitudinous remarks they made about mutual friendship at their summit appearances. Putin\u2019s toast, however, alluded to the subtext of the summit: The ongoing and unresolved crisis over North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. Related article North Korea's leader meets Putin. Will Trump be jealous? \u201cWe welcome DPRK leadership\u2019s steps to establish a dialogue with the US and to normalize relations between South and North Koreas,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re coming from a stand that there\u2019s no alternative to peaceful solution of nuclear and other problems of the region.\u201d That dialogue between Pyongyang and Washington, however, has faltered. Back in February, President Donald Trump walked away from a summit in Hanoi with Kim with no joint agreement after the North Korean leader insisted all US sanctions be lifted on his country. Thursday\u2019s Russia-North Korean summit also ended without a joint statement, a typical feature of such high-level meetings between heads of state. But visuals mattered in Vladivostok perhaps as much as words. Absent many details about the closed-door meetings, much of the coverage focused on the theatrics around the summit, including the seemingly \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d-themed gifts (the two leaders exchanged ornate swords) and the North Korean leader\u2019s somewhat sinister-looking choice of transport (Kim arrived from Pyongyang on an armored train). And the fact that the summit seemed to go as planned was, well, a victory for the Kremlin. Related article Ringleader of ... [Content truncated]",
