        "Question": "Does the video show Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin drinking after toasting?",
        "Answer": "The video does not show Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin drinking after toasting. Although the claim suggests that the two leaders raised their glasses for a toast and then placed their drinks down without consuming, this portrayal has been manipulated. According to fact-checking sources, the video was edited to reverse the actual sequence of events, which indicates that after toasting, both leaders did sip from their drinks. This information has been confirmed by Snopes, stating that the video gives a false impression of the encounter, which actually ended with both leaders drinking from their glasses after raising them in a toast. Moreover, additional context from various reports indicates that during a banquet, they did drink Russian wine and engaged in toasting amidst discussions of their diplomatic ties. Therefore, the evidence suggests that the original video misrepresents the true sequence by not showing the drinking that followed the toast.",
