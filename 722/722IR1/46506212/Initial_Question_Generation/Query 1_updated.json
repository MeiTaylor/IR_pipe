I couldn\u2019t speak to anyone from my glass cage surrounded by police guards and court bailiffs, but for the few minutes it took the presiding judge to read out the (predetermined) decision, I could see the faces, smiles, tears and thumbs-ups of my friends, colleagues and supporters, as well as journalists and diplomats who packed the courtroom. This was the first time I had seen most of them (except for the handful who were witnesses at my proceedings) since and my trial at the Moscow City Court, which was held entirely behind closed doors.

In Odesa six beaches were officially opened for swimming - for the first time since the start of a full-scale war.

However, people also continue to swim on the other beaches of the city, where swimming is prohibited. (Photo by Viacheslav Onyshchenko/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images) A number of videos featuring bikini-clad women made the rounds on Twitter this weekend, but not for the reasons some might expect. The clips purported to show a beach on the Black Sea near the Ukrainian city of Odesa after it reportedly reopened for the first time since Russia's invasion. The post was met with a backlash as those critical of U.S. and other Western aid being provided to Ukraine voiced their frustration that it didn't resemble a warzone. However, other users on Twitter soon weighed in that the video was actually filmed at the Strandbad Pl\u00f6tzensee, a lake in the city of Berlin, Germany! Another video also circulated showing a party-like gathering at the Ibiza Beach Club in Odesa. It does resemble the images and videos on the club's official website, and it is\u2014or at least was\u2014a very popular hotspot, yet, it remains unclear when the video may have actually been filmed. The club's Facebook page hasn't been updated since 2018 and no videos have been posted to its YouTube page since July of 2021\u2014more than six months before Russia launched its unprovoked invasion. It would appear that the Ibiza Beach Club in Odesa may still be closed. However, there is a grain of truth to the story. As Reuters reported on ... [Content truncated]",

A United Kingdom-based organization that investigates weapon components says it has discovered Russian efforts to produce its own domestic version of Iran\u2019s Shahed series drones. Conflict Armament Research (CAR) has previously documented drones in Ukraine that are marked with the Russian word for geranium, \u201cgeran,\u201d implying at first glance that they are of Russian origin. The research center had said the unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, were all Iranian-made Shahed-131 and Shahed-136 models. But when CAR investigators got their hands on the physical remnants of two Geran-2 Russian drones used in Ukraine last month, a detailed analysis showed that Russia \u201chas started producing and fielding its own domestic version of the Shahed-136,\u201d the research center said. Investigators said \u201cmajor differences in the airframe construction and in the internal units, including for navigation\u201d showed that the two UAVs were manufactured in Russia rather than Iran. The researchers described the development as a turning point in Moscow\u2019s ability to extend its heavy use of the unmanned weapons. \u201cAlmost a year after the first use of Iranian-manufactured UAVs in Ukraine, evidence that the Russian Federation has begun producing its own domestic versions marks a significant evolution in the country\u2019s UAV capabilities that will allow it to sustain its reliance on single-use UAVs,\u201d investigators wrote. Russia \u201cnow has more than one pathway to still be able to sustain its current attack patterns\u201d in Ukraine, CAR added. The researchers said Russia \u201chas distilled the principles of the Shahed series UAV, while simplifying its functioning by combining new solutions\u201d and will likely be able to produce new UAVs fairly quickly.
