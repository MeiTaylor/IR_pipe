I remember sitting at my desk staring, frozen, watching from afar what was happening to my peace-loving, newly democratic Ukraine. The missile explosions in the heart of Kyiv’s residential districts meant people’s families, apartments, relationships were being ruined — people I know and have known all my life. I knew the invasion was imminent, based on the numerous warnings coming from U.S. intelligence and my own assessment of the situation. I had been a journalist based in Kyiv since 2014, and I’m now in my first year at the Harvard Kennedy School. Just during winter break, I spent a few weeks in festive Kyiv visiting former colleagues and friends. But it is one thing to “know” and hope that world leaders can somehow magically stop a tyrant, and it is another thing to see your home being invaded. In an instant, 44 million people went through a massive collective trauma. A fledgling democracy, so inspiring to so many, full of hope and verve, has been attacked in such a cowardly and malicious manner. Stop imagining Putin’s overthrow. Fantasies won’t help Ukraine. I had a similar experience when I was studying in the U.S. for my undergraduate degree in 2013 and 2014 when Ukraine’s Euromaidan revolution broke out. I remember the shock and emotions that came from seeing the first deaths: Ukrainians being mercilessly beaten and shot on the streets of Kyiv by the horde of police and Berkut special forces that were an extension of the Kremlin’s puppet regime under Ukraine’s then-president Viktor Yanukovych.

        "Question": "What evidence supports the presence of a beach party in Kyiv during the Ukraine war?",
        "Answer": "The evidence supporting the presence of a beach party in Kyiv during the Ukraine war includes the following points:\n\n1. **Authentic Video Evidence**: A video that went viral on social media captured scenes from a beach party at the Fifty Beach Club in Kyiv. This video was recorded on August 6, 2023, and depicts people enjoying themselves in a beach club atmosphere, including scenes of individuals sunbathing and socializing. An article from Snopes confirms the authenticity of this video and acknowledges its viral spread, despite its usage as supposed evidence of the war being a hoax [Query 1_evidence_1].\n\n2. **Public Reaction and Context**: The same video sparked significant public discussion and backlash, with many social media users expressing disbelief about the situation in Ukraine, as they saw the video as contradictory to the narratives of ongoing conflict. This reaction further highlights that a beach party did indeed occur in Kyiv, giving a glimpse into life amidst the war. Newsweek reported on the video, noting that it showed \"hundreds of people partying around the pool bar\" at the same beach club, reinforcing the idea that life continued to some extent in urban areas like Kyiv [Query 1_evidence_2].\n\n3. **Statements from Locals**: The context provided by users posting the videos indicates a conscious effort to present a balanced view of life in Ukraine during the war. Edward, one of the users who posted videos, mentioned aiming to showcase different aspects of life in Ukraine, which suggests that such social activities are, in fact, occurring [Query 1_evidence_2]. \n\nGiven this evidence, we can confidently state that the beach party in Kyiv did occur amidst the ongoing conflict. However, while the presence of the party is documented, it does not negate the reality of the war itself.",
