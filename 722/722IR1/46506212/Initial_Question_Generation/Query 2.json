A video of Ukrainians partying at a beach club has gone viral amid a debate overseas about whether or not the United States and the West should support any for the war. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, the U.S. has committed to more than $60 billion in , the most of any of Kyiv's Western allies.

Social media users quickly flooded the comments to cast doubt about the state of the war between Ukraine and Russia, asking \"Why are we all panicked and worried when it is party season over there\" and joking \"Well, at least the Americans are footing the bill.\" !

I remember sitting at my desk staring, frozen, watching from afar what was happening to my peace-loving, newly democratic Ukraine. The missile explosions in the heart of Kyiv’s residential districts meant people’s families, apartments, relationships were being ruined — people I know and have known all my life.
