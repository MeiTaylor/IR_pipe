Some 5.3 million children face barriers preventing access to education, including 3.6 million children directly affected by school closures. This places children in Ukraine at risk of losing critical years of schooling and social development. Since February 2022, UNICEF has supported nearly 1.5 million of the most vulnerable children in Ukraine to access formal and non-formal education, including early learning. Since war began, over 2,600 schools have been damaged and over 400 destroyed across Ukraine, according to the Ministry of Education.

Education is critical to children\u2019s well-being and social development. It cannot be put on hold without risking the future of an entire generation.

Derogations from the rights to freedom of expression and religion continued under martial law. Recorded cases of domestic violence rose sharply. New draft legislation on civil partnerships included same-sex relationships. The war continued to have a devastating impact on economic and social rights, particularly of children and older people, as well as on the environment. Serious human rights violations continued in Russian occupied territories. ### Background Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine continued, resulting in civilian deaths, destruction of infrastructure, and consistently high levels of internally displaced people and refugees. As of November, the UN had recorded 28,711 civilian casualties since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022, including 10,058 deaths. A Ukrainian counteroffensive made minimal territorial gains, opening the prospect of a prolonged war of attrition and raising concerns about sustainability of military support from Ukraine\u2019s allies. The economy continued to significantly contract, with a growing dependency on foreign grants and loans. In July Russia withdrew from the Black Sea Grain Initiative intended to ensure stable food prices and avert the threat of famine in lower-income countries. On 14 December, the European Council decided to open EU accession negotiations with Ukraine. Violations of international humanitarian law -------------------------------------------- Russian forces continued indiscriminate attacks hitting populated areas, resulting in widespread civilian casualties. In some instances, official Russian comments on the strikes indicated that these were likely deliberately targeted. On 5 October, at least 59 people were killed in a single missile strike on a caf\u00e9 in the village of Hroza, Kharkiv region, during a memorial service for a Ukrainian soldier. A Russian representative at the UN spoke of the attendees as the soldier\u2019s \u201cNazi ... [Content truncated]",

Her father, my grandpa, was an avid Radio Free Europe (RFE) listener, who listened daily; patiently waiting for the day that Poland would be scoured of the stain of the Soviets. My father was also born in Poland, but to Ukrainian parents who had been forcibly relocated by Polish authorities loyal to the Soviets during \u201cOperation Vistula\u201d, which was an attempt to eradicate Ukrainian partisans in southeastern Poland.

The war in Ukraine could continue as a war of attrition for months or even years, with neither side able to conduct an operation with a decisive outcome, Stanford scholar told Stanford News. ] The Kremlin underestimated Ukrainian\u2019s determination to resist, says Steven Pifer, an affiliate at Stanford\u2019s Center for International Security and Cooperation. (Image credit: Damian M. Marhefka) Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and an affiliate at Stanford\u2019s , discussed how he anticipates the conflict will continue to unfold, and what it will take to bring it to an end. He also shared a glimpse of what life is like right now for Ukrainians, who remain fiercely determined to resist Russian occupation. Pifer\u2019s research focuses on nuclear arms control, Ukraine, Russia, and European security. He spent more than 25 years working with the U.S. State Department, where he focused on America\u2019s relations with the former Soviet Union and Europe, as well as arms control and security issues. He served as deputy assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs with responsibilities for Russia and Ukraine (2001-2004), ambassador to Ukraine (1998-2000), and special assistant to the president and senior director for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia on the National Security Council (1996-1997). **Twelve months into the conflict, what do you find most troubling?** The war \u2013 or this latest phase in a conflict that began in 2014 with the Russian military\u2019s illegal seizure of Crimea \u2013 has been a terrible tragedy for Ukraine and Ukrainians.

In 2023, the Commission was replaced by the NATO-Ukraine Council, where Allies and Ukraine sit as equals. This change demonstrates the strengthening of political ties and Ukraine\u2019s increasing integration with NATO. * Cooperation has deepened over time and is mutually beneficial. Ukraine has a long track record of active contributions to NATO-led operations and missions. **Political and practical support to Ukraine** * NATO condemns Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine in the strongest possible terms.
