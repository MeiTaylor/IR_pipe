This belief and the limited impact the war in Ukraine has had on the day-to-day lives of most Russians go some way to explaining continuing high levels of support for the war among Russians. In the nearly two years since Russia launched its “special military operation” against Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Russian society has gotten used to living against the backdrop of a brutal armed conflict. A significant part of the population has reconciled itself to the idea that they will be living under the current state of affairs for quite some time, and that they must therefore adjust to reality, which ordinary Russians are in any case unable—and often unwilling—to change. All the naïve predictions that popular discontent triggered by sanctions and the wartime restrictions imposed on daily life would bring down Vladimir Putin’s regime have come to nothing. In many ways, quite the opposite has happened. Most Russians might not identify with the regime, but they have consolidated around the Kremlin, which they believe to be fighting tooth and nail against a West that is seeking to destroy Russia. Despite the fact that such a depiction is at odds with reality, a great many Russians have accepted it as the most logical explanation for this protracted nightmare.

Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified aggression against Ukraine has **further driven up prices.** Due to the war Ukraine, a leading grain exporter, has seen a **dramatic drop in its exports**. This has resulted in major food security concerns for millions of people around the world. The actions of the EU and the United Nations have helped curb the price rise, but the outlook remains difficult. Reduced grain exports, higher food prices ------------------------------------------ Before the war, around 90% of Ukraine’s agricultural exports were transported by sea. After the start of the war, the **Russian military blocked Ukraine’s Black Sea ports** and brought exports to a virtual standstill. ### Ukraine’s wheat exports suffering from the war A line chart shows the export volumes of wheat from January 2021 to August 2023. In March, April and May 2022, after the Russian invasion, exports dropped by over 90%. From June onwards, export volumes grew, but they were still much lower than in 2021, even in September and October, when exports reached a peak, they were 57% and 42% lower than in 2021. Since then exports are gradually declining with some fluctuations. Following the actions taken by the EU to implement alternative transport routes (‘**solidarity lanes**’), and by the UN and Türkiye to unblock the ports (the ‘**Black Sea Grain Initiative’**), exports grew and food prices steadily declined. However, in July 2023 **Russia withdrew from the Black Sea Grain Initiative**. Until that time 40% of Ukraine’s grain had been transported via the Black Sea ports, while 60% went overland via the solidarity lanes. **12 May 2022** ### Solidarity lanes The EU establishes overland transport routes, which help to move the mountains of grain that had built up in silos. **​22 July 2022** ### Black Sea Grain ...

We’re facing an inflection point in history — one of those moments where the decisions we make today are going to determine the future for decades to come. That’s what I’d like to talk with you about tonight. You know, earlier this morning, I returned from Israel. They tell me I’m the first American president to travel there during a war. I met with the Prime Minister and members of his cabinet. And most movingly, I met with Israelis who had personally lived through horrific horror of the attack by Hamas on the 7th of October. More than 1,300 people slaughtered in Israel, including at least 32 American citizens. Scores of innocents — from infants to elderly grandparents, Israelis, Americans — taken hostage. As I told the families of Americans being held captive by Hamas, we’re pursuing every avenue to bring their loved ones home. As President, there is no higher priority for me than the safety of Americans held hostage. The terrorist group Hamas unleashed pure, unadulterated evil in the world. But sadly, the Jewish people know, perhaps better than anyone, that there is no limit to the depravity of people when they want to inflict pain on others. In Israel, I saw a people who are strong, determined, resilient, and also angry, in shock, and in deep, deep pain. I also spoke with President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority and reiterated that the United States remains committed to the Palestinian people’s right to dignity and to self-determination. The actions of Hamas terrorists don’t take that right away. Like so many other, I am heartbroken by the tragic loss of Palestinian life, including the explosion at a hospital in Gaza — which was not done by the Israelis. We ... [Content truncated]",

The **war disrupted basic services and livelihoods**, damaged infrastructure, and contaminated a vast agricultural region with mines. Civilians living close to the frontlines were exposed to daily hostilities. Even after fleeing, they remained at risk from indiscriminate air strikes. The hostilities, large-scale destruction, disruption of the economy and social services have left millions dependent on humanitarian aid. In Ukraine, **UNHCR worked in complementarity with Government programmes**, providing urgent humanitarian assistance to 2.6 million people. 1.5 million of them received protection support such as legal assistance, information on rights and entitlements, psychosocial support, child protection services and support in relation to gender-based violence. UNHCR delivered cash assistance to nearly 900,000 vulnerable newly displaced people and returnees in 22 regions. People in frontline and hard-to-reach areas urgently needed basic items for cooking, bedding, warmth and hygiene, and UNHCR contributed to 95 inter-agency humanitarian convoys to supply such items to over 575,000 people while shifting towards providing cash assistance rather than goods wherever possible. UNHCR also provided winterization assistance to over 900,000 people, including cash top-ups, relief items, and care in collective sites. Emergency shelter and sustainable housing support was provided to over 247,000 war-affected people, returnees and internally displaced people (IDPs), helping to repair damaged homes and infrastructure.

Displacement, poverty and hunger are persistent, and civilian casualties have increased in recent months with more frequent bombings. After the first year of war, over 8,000 Ukrainian civilians were killed. It caused the one of the fastest population movements since World War II as people were forced to flee from their homes. 6 million people displaced were within Ukraine and another 8 million fled the country as refugees. By March 2023, 11 million Ukrainians faced hunger – almost a third of the population. In the first year of its emergency response, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) delivered 1.3 billion meals, reaching an average of 3 million people each month.

Almost 5 million Ukrainians are still internally displaced and close to 6 million are refugees across Europe. Overall, more than one in three Ukrainians is displaced. Many who return to their homes struggle to rebuild their lives as they have run out of money and found their homes reduced to rubble. The war has also taken a toll on Ukrainians’ mental health.
