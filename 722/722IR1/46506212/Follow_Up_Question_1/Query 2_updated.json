This belief and the limited impact the war in Ukraine has had on the day-to-day lives of most Russians go some way to explaining continuing high levels of support for the war among Russians. In the nearly two years since Russia launched its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d against Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Russian society has gotten used to living against the backdrop of a brutal armed conflict. A significant part of the population has reconciled itself to the idea that they will be living under the current state of affairs for quite some time, and that they must therefore adjust to reality, which ordinary Russians are in any case unable\u2014and often unwilling\u2014to change. All the na\u00efve predictions that popular discontent triggered by sanctions and the wartime restrictions imposed on daily life would bring down Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime have come to nothing. In many ways, quite the opposite has happened. Most Russians might not identify with the regime, but they have consolidated around the Kremlin, which they believe to be fighting tooth and nail against a West that is seeking to destroy Russia. Despite the fact that such a depiction is at odds with reality, a great many Russians have accepted it as the most logical explanation for this protracted nightmare. Naturally, some Russians are unhappy with the situation. Millions of people are opposed to authoritarianism and bloodshed, and some of them openly express their views and resist. There are also those known as \u201cturbo-patriots,\u201d who earnestly and aggressively support Putin. But the vast majority is apathetic, and simply passively and automatically \u201cmostly supports\u201d what the regime is doing while waiting for \u201call this\u201d to end. This part ...

Russia\u2019s unprovoked and unjustified aggression against Ukraine has **further driven up prices.** Due to the war Ukraine, a leading grain exporter, has seen a **dramatic drop in its exports**. This has resulted in major food security concerns for millions of people around the world. The actions of the EU and the United Nations have helped curb the price rise, but the outlook remains difficult. Reduced grain exports, higher food prices ------------------------------------------ Before the war, around 90% of Ukraine\u2019s agricultural exports were transported by sea. After the start of the war, the **Russian military blocked Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea ports** and brought exports to a virtual standstill. ### Ukraine\u2019s wheat exports suffering from the war A line chart shows the export volumes of wheat from January 2021 to August 2023. In March, April and May 2022, after the Russian invasion, exports dropped by over 90%. From June onwards, export volumes grew, but they were still much lower than in 2021, even in September and October, when exports reached a peak, they were 57% and 42% lower than in 2021. Since then exports are gradually declining with some fluctuations. Following the actions taken by the EU to implement alternative transport routes (\u2018**solidarity lanes**\u2019), and by the UN and T\u00fcrkiye to unblock the ports (the \u2018**Black Sea Grain Initiative\u2019**), exports grew and food prices steadily declined. However, in July 2023 **Russia withdrew from the Black Sea Grain Initiative**. Until that time 40% of Ukraine\u2019s grain had been transported via the Black Sea ports, while 60% went overland via the solidarity lanes. **12 May 2022** ### Solidarity lanes The EU establishes overland transport routes, which help to move the mountains of grain that had built up in silos. **\u200b22 July 2022** ### Black Sea Grain ...

We\u2019re facing an inflection point in history \u2014 one of those moments where the decisions we make today are going to determine the future for decades to come. That\u2019s what I\u2019d like to talk with you about tonight. You know, earlier this morning, I returned from Israel. They tell me I\u2019m the first American president to travel there during a war. I met with the Prime Minister and members of his cabinet. And most movingly, I met with Israelis who had personally lived through horrific horror of the attack by Hamas on the 7th of October. More than 1,300 people slaughtered in Israel, including at least 32 American citizens. Scores of innocents \u2014 from infants to elderly grandparents, Israelis, Americans \u2014 taken hostage. As I told the families of Americans being held captive by Hamas, we\u2019re pursuing every avenue to bring their loved ones home. As President, there is no higher priority for me than the safety of Americans held hostage. The terrorist group Hamas unleashed pure, unadulterated evil in the world. But sadly, the Jewish people know, perhaps better than anyone, that there is no limit to the depravity of people when they want to inflict pain on others. In Israel, I saw a people who are strong, determined, resilient, and also angry, in shock, and in deep, deep pain. I also spoke with President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority and reiterated that the United States remains committed to the Palestinian people\u2019s right to dignity and to self-determination. The actions of Hamas terrorists don\u2019t take that right away. Like so many other, I am heartbroken by the tragic loss of Palestinian life, including the explosion at a hospital in Gaza \u2014 which was not done by the Israelis. We ... [Content truncated]",

The **war disrupted basic services and livelihoods**, damaged infrastructure, and contaminated a vast agricultural region with mines. Civilians living close to the frontlines were exposed to daily hostilities. Even after fleeing, they remained at risk from indiscriminate air strikes. The hostilities, large-scale destruction, disruption of the economy and social services have left millions dependent on humanitarian aid. In Ukraine, **UNHCR worked in complementarity with Government programmes**, providing urgent humanitarian assistance to 2.6 million people. 1.5 million of them received protection support such as legal assistance, information on rights and entitlements, psychosocial support, child protection services and support in relation to gender-based violence. UNHCR delivered cash assistance to nearly 900,000 vulnerable newly displaced people and returnees in 22 regions. People in frontline and hard-to-reach areas urgently needed basic items for cooking, bedding, warmth and hygiene, and UNHCR contributed to 95 inter-agency humanitarian convoys to supply such items to over 575,000 people while shifting towards providing cash assistance rather than goods wherever possible. UNHCR also provided winterization assistance to over 900,000 people, including cash top-ups, relief items, and care in collective sites. Emergency shelter and sustainable housing support was provided to over 247,000 war-affected people, returnees and internally displaced people (IDPs), helping to repair damaged homes and infrastructure. With support from UNHCR and other partners, the Government of Ukraine adopted a \u201c\u201d and legislation on compensation for housing damaged or destroyed due to the war. UNHCR ...
