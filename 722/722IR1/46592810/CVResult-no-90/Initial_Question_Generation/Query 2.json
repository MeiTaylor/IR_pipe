EBV infection can range from asymptomatic to infectious mononucleosis. Complications are rare, but important to recognize. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of the Epstein Barr virus and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition. **Objectives:** * Identify the etiology and epidemiology of Epstein Barr virus. * Review the physical exam findings and lab results of patients with Epstein Barr virus. * Outline the treatment options and possible complications of Epstein Barr virus. * Describe the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care coordination for patients affected by Epstein Barr virus. Introduction ------------ Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is a double-stranded DNA virus that infects B lymphocyte cells. It is in the herpesvirus family and was discovered in 1964.]] It can cause a variety of diseases and is spread mainly from saliva containing virus-infected epithelial cells.]] Close to 95% of adults throughout the world have been infected with EBV.] It is a causative agent of infectious mononucleosis. Treatment is generally supportive care.] Etiology -------- Epstein Barr virus is a herpesvirus with double-stranded DNA enclosed by proteins. The envelope of the virus has glycoproteins, which are important for attachment and entry into the host cells (B cells and epithelial cells). EBV targets B cells by utilizing their molecular machinery to replicate the viral genome. The virus causes B cells to differentiate into memory B cells, which then can move into the circulatory system, or become latent until a trigger causes reactivation.] The transmission of the Epstein Barr virus occurs in several ways, such as deep kissing or food-sharing. Increased levels of viral DNA are found in salivary secretions ... [Content truncated]",

While the to what was about Epstein’s offenses, they gave fodder to people eager to fictionalize the late, convicted sex offender’s impact on high-profile people and evidence of his crimes. From fake photos generated by to , several misleading pieces of media circulated widely in tandem with the documents' release. Here's a sample: * . Although there are of the two together ( a “terrific guy” and in the recently unsealed documents), this image of them on a plane, in particular, is fake. * at a hospital recently to distract the public from the aforementioned documents. The footage was actually from 2021. ( also appeared in the newly released records.) * playing with paper airplanes while sitting in front of two collapsed Jenga towers. While the painting is real, there’s no credible evidence to confirm (or disprove) Epstein owned it. * . In reality, the man is Monte Lipman, the CEO of Republic Records. * . No evidence connected the video to him. * . There were telltale signs of the photo being fake. For instance, the faces of people in the background are deformed and Trump has only one leg. Think you’ve come across a fake photo or miscaptioned video involving Epstein? for potential fact-checking. Not all rumors linking Epstein to former presidents are made up. For instance, showing Trump with two of his children, Ivanka and Eric, alongside Epstein in the ‘90s is real, as well as that was taken a few years later including Melania Trump and Epstein’s longtime partner, Ghislaine ...

The names were unsealed from a lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre, an alleged trafficking victim, against British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend. Maxwell, 62, is serving a 20-year prison sentence after she was convicted in December 2021 of helping Epstein recruit and sexually abuse underage girls. Many of those whose names appear in the documents released on Wednesday aren't accused of wrongdoing or have been mentioned previously in legal proceedings or news accounts. Despite persistent assertions across social media, the documents released on Wednesday are not an Epstein \"client list.\" In December, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska found no legal justification for continuing to withhold the names of as many as 175 individuals allegedly connected with Epstein, ordering the unsealing to begin from January 1. Some portions of the records will remain confidential, including those identifying people who were children when they were sexually abused by Epstein, who died by suicide in August 2019 in a federal prison in Manhattan as he awaited trial on sex-trafficking charges. With the release of the names including a number of celebrities, a clip of comedian Gervais taking swipes at celebrities while hosting the 2020 Golden Globe Awards has been shared on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. As he stood before the crowd gathered in Beverly Hills to toast TV and movie talent, five-time host Gervais said: \"In this room are some of the most important TV and film executives in the world, from all different backgrounds. But they all have one thing in common—they're all terrified of Ronan Farrow. ... [Content truncated]",
