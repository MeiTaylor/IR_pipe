The late-night host hit back at the NFL star for comments he made during an appearance on the Pat McAfee Show. Rodgers and others began discussing Epstein, including the impending list of people associated with the convicted pedophile. \"A lot of people, including Jimmy Kimmel, are hoping that doesn't come out,\" the New York Jets quarterback said on the show, adding that he would pop \"some sort of bottle\" when the list was finally released. Epstein died by suicide while in custody awaiting trial on federal conspiracy and sex trafficking charges. He was previously jailed for procuring sex with an underage girl. A judge signed an order on December 18 for the public release of the identities of more than 150 people mentioned in court documents from a now-settled 2015 civil lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre that centered on allegations that Epstein's associate and former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated her sexual abuse. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for helping Epstein recruit and sexually abuse underage girls. Kimmel hit back at Rodgers' comments on X, formerly Twitter, saying he had not \"had any contact whatsoever with Epstein\" and \"nor will you find my name on any 'list' other than the clearly-phony nonsense that soft-brained wackos like yourself can't seem to distinguish from reality.\" \"Your reckless words put my family in danger. Keep it up and we will debate the facts further in court,\" the comedian added. NEW: Quarterback Aaron Rodgers says he will pop \"some sort of bottle\" when the Epstein associates list is released and suggests Jimmy Kimmel will be named.Everyone is excited \ud83d\udd25\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people, including Jimmy ...

Former Palm Beach police Det. Joseph Recarey, who is now deceased, said in 2016 that Ghislaine Maxwell, , was involved in seeking girls to give massages and work at Epstein\u2019s home. Recarey said he interviewed around 33 women, according to a transcript. Only two, who were older, had any massage experience, he said. Most of the girls were younger than 18. \"Each of the victims that went to the home were asked to bring their friends to the home. Some complied and some didn\u2019t,\" Recarey said. The descriptions of how women were recruited contained in the documents is consistent with what was testified to at Maxwell\u2019s criminal trial. Nineteen exhibits totaling 327 pages of previously sealed documents were released Thursday by a federal court in New York. The disclosure is part of a settled lawsuit first filed in 2015 against British socialite and Epstein confidant by , who said she was a victim of sex trafficking and abuse when she was a teenager in the early 2000s.

The names were unsealed from a lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre, an alleged trafficking victim, against British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend. Maxwell, 62, is serving a 20-year prison sentence after she was convicted in December 2021 of helping Epstein recruit and sexually abuse underage girls. Many of those whose names appear in the documents released on Wednesday aren't accused of wrongdoing or have been mentioned previously in legal proceedings or news accounts. Despite persistent assertions across social media, the documents released on Wednesday are not an Epstein \"client list.\" In December, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska found no legal justification for continuing to withhold the names of as many as 175 individuals allegedly connected with Epstein, ordering the unsealing to begin from January 1. Some portions of the records will remain confidential, including those identifying people who were children when they were sexually abused by Epstein, who died by suicide in August 2019 in a federal prison in Manhattan as he awaited trial on sex-trafficking charges. With the release of the names including a number of celebrities, a clip of comedian Gervais taking swipes at celebrities while hosting the 2020 Golden Globe Awards has been shared on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. As he stood before the crowd gathered in Beverly Hills to toast TV and movie talent, five-time host Gervais said: \"In this room are some of the most important TV and film executives in the world, from all different backgrounds. But they all have one thing in common\u2014they're all terrified of Ronan Farrow. ... [Content truncated]",

The Technology and International Affairs Program develops insights to address the governance challenges and large-scale risks of new technologies. Our experts identify actionable best practices and incentives for industry and government leaders on artificial intelligence, cyber threats, cloud security, countering influence operations, reducing the risk of biotechnologies, and ensuring global digital inclusion. The goal of the Partnership for Countering Influence Operations (PCIO) is to foster evidence-based policymaking to counter threats in the information environment. Key roadblocks as found in our work include the lack of: transparency reporting to inform what data is available for research purposes; rules guiding how data can be shared with researchers and for what purposes; and an international mechanism for fostering research collaboration at-scale. Carnegie\u2019s Information Environment Project is a multistakeholder effort to help policymakers understand the information environment, think through the impact of efforts to govern it, and identify promising interventions to foster democracy. The lingering coronavirus pandemic has only underscored the need to find effective interventions to help internet users evaluate the credibility of the information before them. Yet a divide remains between researchers within digital platforms and those in academia and other research professions who are analyzing interventions. Beyond issues related to data access, a challenge deserving papers of its own, opportunities exist to clarify the core competencies of each research community and to build bridges between them in pursuit of the shared goal of improving user-facing interventions that address misinformation online. This paper attempts to contribute to such bridge-building by posing questions for discussion: How do different incentive structures determine the selection of outcome metrics and the design of research studies by academics and platform researchers, ...
