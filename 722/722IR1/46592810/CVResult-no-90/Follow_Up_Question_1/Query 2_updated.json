We addressed several of those claims. We fact-checked former President Donald Trump\u2019s speech accepting his party\u2019s nomination. Viral online posts make the unfounded claim that a woman at former President Donald Trump\u2019s July 13 rally acted \u201csuspicious,\u201d suggesting that she might have been involved in a plot to assassinate Trump, and that a QAnon-related character may have also been involved. The FBI has said that the \u201cinvestigation to date indicates the shooter acted alone.\u201d A chart widely shared on social media comparing macroeconomic indicators purports to show the country fared better under former President Donald Trump than President Joe Biden. However, the chart cites some figures that are inaccurate, outdated or misleading. FactCheck.org staff writer Catalina Jaramillo spoke with La Red Hispana, a Spanish-language media network, about our efforts to combat misinformation in Spanish. During his speech at the Republican National Convention, Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota talked about \u201crioters\u201d in Minneapolis after the death of George Floyd in 2020, and misleadingly said that Vice President Kamala Harris \u201cfreed\u201d from jail one of \u201cthe criminals\u201d who \u201cwent on to murder a man\u201d in neighboring St. Paul. Emmer is distorting the facts. In a leaked phone call with independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., former President Donald Trump incorrectly suggested that childhood vaccine doses are too large and can provoke sudden, radical changes in babies. There\u2019s no evidence that the current vaccination schedule is harmful to kids. Former President Donald Trump\u2019s newly selected running mate, JD Vance, accepted the Republican Party\u2019s vice presidential nomination on the convention\u2019s third night, which featured claims about the economy, immigration and foreign policy.

I got sick the way Hemingway says you go broke: \u201cgradually and then suddenly.\u201d One way to tell the story is to say that I was ill for a long time\u2014at least half a dozen years\u2014before any doctor I saw believed I had a disease. Another is to say that it took hold in 2009, the stressful year after my mother died, when a debilitating fatigue overcame me, my lymph nodes ached for months, and a test suggested that I had recently had Epstein-Barr virus. Still another way is to say that it began in February of 2012, on a windy beach in Vietnam; my boyfriend and I were reading by the water when I noticed a rash on my inner arm\u2014seven or eight vibrantly red bumps. At home in New York, three days later, I had a low fever. For weeks, I drifted along in a flulike malaise that I thought was protracted jet lag. I began getting headaches and feeling dizzy when I ate. At talks I gave, I found myself forgetting words. I kept reversing phrases\u2014saying things like \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the cooler water.\u201d One morning in March, I sat down at my desk to work, and found I could no longer write or read; my brain seemed enveloped in a thick gray fog. I wondered if it was a result of too much Internet surfing, and a lack of will power. I wondered if I was depressed. But I _wanted_ to work. I didn\u2019t feel apathy, only a weird sense that my mind and my body weren\u2019t synched. Was I going mad? Then I started to think about the curious symptoms I\u2019d had on ...

I recorded several videos. Science.feedback.org has done a fact check on my 5 minute video, which is the topic of this post Here is information about Prager U. Here are links to my two videos. **JC\u2019s Prager U text** Let\u2019s start with the good news. All things considered, planet earth is doing fine. Humans are doing better than at any other time in history. Over the last hundred years, when temperatures have warmed by about two degrees Fahrenheit: * Global population has _in_creased by 6 billion people * Global poverty has substantially _de_creased * And the number of people killed from weather disasters has _decreased_ by 97% on a per capita basis. We are obviously not facing an existential crisis. Anyone who tells you that we are, is not paying attention to the historical data. Instead, they are concerned about what \u201cmight\u201d happen in the future, based on predictions from inadequate climate models, driven by unrealistic assumptions. I offer this positive diagnosis after a lifetime of study on the issue. Until recently, I was a professor of climate science and Chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology. But it\u2019s not all good news. The biggest problem with climate change is not climate change, per se, it\u2019s how we\u2019re _dealing_ with it. We\u2019re attempting to control the uncontrollable, at _great_ cost, by urgently eliminating fossil fuels. We\u2019ve failed to properly place the risks from climate change in context of _other_ challenges the world is facing. Climate change has become a ... [Content truncated]",
