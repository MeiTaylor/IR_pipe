Rodgers and others began discussing Epstein, including the impending list of people associated with the convicted pedophile. \"A lot of people, including Jimmy Kimmel, are hoping that doesn't come out,\" the New York Jets quarterback said on the show, adding that he would pop \"some sort of bottle\" when the list was finally released. Epstein died by suicide while in custody awaiting trial on federal conspiracy and sex trafficking charges. He was previously jailed for procuring sex with an underage girl. A judge signed an order on December 18 for the public release of the identities of more than 150 people mentioned in court documents from a now-settled 2015 civil lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre that centered on allegations that Epstein's associate and former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated her sexual abuse. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for helping Epstein recruit and sexually abuse underage girls. Kimmel hit back at Rodgers' comments on X, formerly Twitter, saying he had not \"had any contact whatsoever with Epstein\" and \"nor will you find my name on any 'list' other than the clearly-phony nonsense that soft-brained wackos like yourself can't seem to distinguish from reality.\" \"Your reckless words put my family in danger.

Here are the reasons:\n\n1. **Lack of Concrete Evidence**: Fact-checking sources have analyzed the video and found that there is no concrete evidence connecting the video‚Äôs location or the individuals depicted to Epstein's island. Despite claims and viral discussions, rigorous examinations highlight that these associations are completely unsubstantiated [Query 2_evidence_1].\n\n2. **Speculative Nature of Claims**: The claims surrounding the video are characterized as largely speculative. Many reports emphasize that the viral nature of this video follows renewed media interest in Epstein's controversies, yet no reliable evidence has emerged to authenticate its origins or assert that it showcases participants linked to Epstein‚Äôs activities or property [Query 2_evidence_2].\n\n3. **Misinformation Trends**: The discourse relating to the video points to a broader trend of misinformation concerning Jeffrey Epstein's legacy. The lack of credible sources or substantial proof supporting the video reinforces skepticism about its authenticity and the validity of the claims made regarding it [Query 2_evidence_3].\n\nGiven the analysis of the evidence and the clarity with which it indicates the absence of verification regarding the video's claims, I would evaluate the confidence in this conclusion as high, at **85%**. This confidence level reflects a strong consensus among multiple fact-checking efforts pointing towards misleading narratives and a definitive lack of verifying evidence.",
