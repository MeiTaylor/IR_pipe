We addressed several of those claims. We fact-checked former President Donald Trump\u2019s speech accepting his party\u2019s nomination. Viral online posts make the unfounded claim that a woman at former President Donald Trump\u2019s July 13 rally acted \u201csuspicious,\u201d suggesting that she might have been involved in a plot to assassinate Trump, and that a QAnon-related character may have also been involved. The FBI has said that the \u201cinvestigation to date indicates the shooter acted alone.\u201d A chart widely shared on social media comparing macroeconomic indicators purports to show the country fared better under former President Donald Trump than President Joe Biden. However, the chart cites some figures that are inaccurate, outdated or misleading. FactCheck.org staff writer Catalina Jaramillo spoke with La Red Hispana, a Spanish-language media network, about our efforts to combat misinformation in Spanish. During his speech at the Republican National Convention, Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota talked about \u201crioters\u201d in Minneapolis after the death of George Floyd in 2020, and misleadingly said that Vice President Kamala Harris \u201cfreed\u201d from jail one of \u201cthe criminals\u201d who \u201cwent on to murder a man\u201d in neighboring St. Paul. Emmer is distorting the facts. In a leaked phone call with independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., former President Donald Trump incorrectly suggested that childhood vaccine doses are too large and can provoke sudden, radical changes in babies. There\u2019s no evidence that the current vaccination schedule is harmful to kids. Former President Donald Trump\u2019s newly selected running mate, JD Vance, accepted the Republican Party\u2019s vice presidential nomination on the convention\u2019s third night, which featured claims about the economy, immigration and foreign policy.

Several names were revealed after documents from a lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre, an alleged trafficking victim, against British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend, were unsealed on Wednesday.

A Harvard Law School professor and high-profile defense lawyer, Dershowitz helped negotiate a \u201cnon-prosecution agreement\u201d under which Epstein served just 13 months in a county jail, much of it spent on \u201cwork release\u201d in an office. Ever since details of that agreement were reported by , Dershowitz and his role in the deal have been under added scrutiny. That only increased this week with the publication of a , detailing not just Dershowitz\u2019s role in defending Epstein, but also allegations by two women who say that they were directed to have sex with Dershowitz while in Epstein\u2019s orbit. Dershowitz vehemently denies both allegations. Despite widespread attention to his role in the Epstein case \u2014 and a defamation suit from one of his accusers \u2014 Dershowitz has no intention of laying low. For instance, he continues to publicly criticize age-of-consent laws \u2014 most recently , earlier this week. For some, his defense of Epstein is a reminder of the way the American legal system continues to favor powerful men who can pay high-profile attorneys. But Dershowitz sees himself as the wronged party, victimized by women who are lying about him, but determined to clear his name. \u201cI\u2019m a victim of false accusation,\u201d he told Vox, \u201cand I\u2019m going to continue to speak out until the day I die.\u201d Alan Dershowitz got famous by defending wealthy, high-profile clients --------------------------------------------------------------------- Dershowitz started his career as an advocate for civil liberties, Bruck writes, taking on pro bono cases that challenged censorship laws and the death penalty. He was hired as an assistant professor at Harvard Law School in 1964, while still in his 20s. But in the \u201980s and \u201990s, Bruck ... [Content truncated]",

Many of those same operational challenges, including staffing shortages, managing inmates at risk for suicide, functional security camera systems, and management failures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and procedures, were again identified by the OIG during this investigation and review into the custody, care, and supervision of one of the BOP\u2019s most notorious inmates, Jeffrey Epstein. The OIG initiated this investigation upon receipt of information from the BOP that on August 10, 2019, in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York (MCC New York), Epstein was found hanged in his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit (SHU).
