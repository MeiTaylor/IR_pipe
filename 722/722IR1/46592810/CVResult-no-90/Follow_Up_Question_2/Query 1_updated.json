The documents reveal more names and details about people connected to Epstein in a variety of ways, most of whom have not been accused of any wrongdoing. The documents \u2014 more than 190 exhibits, totaling 3,025 pages so far \u2014 stem from a now-settled defamation lawsuit brought against Maxwell by Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre.

The hundreds of pages of depositions, incident reports, court filings, emails and other documents include names of witnesses, accusers, members of Epstein's staff, members of law enforcement and others. One of the documents released Friday, the transcript of a videotaped 2009 deposition of Tijuan Alessi, a manager of Epstein's Florida house, included names of a number of famous people he said visited or stayed over there. Alessi testified he saw \"many celebrities,\" including Britain's Prince Andrew and Andrew's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, at the house. Andrew \"spent weeks with us,\" sleeping in the main guest bedroom and getting \"daily massages,\" Alessi said. \"...I think Sarah was there only once and for a short time.\" She is not accused of any wrongdoing. Prince Andrew settled a lawsuit in 2022 ... [Content truncated]",
