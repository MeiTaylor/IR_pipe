We addressed several of those claims. We fact-checked former President Donald Trump’s speech accepting his party’s nomination. Viral online posts make the unfounded claim that a woman at former President Donald Trump’s July 13 rally acted “suspicious,” suggesting that she might have been involved in a plot to assassinate Trump, and that a QAnon-related character may have also been involved.

A Harvard Law School professor and high-profile defense lawyer, Dershowitz helped negotiate a “non-prosecution agreement” under which Epstein served just 13 months in a county jail, much of it spent on “work release” in an office.

He was hired as an assistant professor at Harvard Law School in 1964, while still in his 20s. But in the ’80s and ’90s, Bruck ... [Content truncated]",
