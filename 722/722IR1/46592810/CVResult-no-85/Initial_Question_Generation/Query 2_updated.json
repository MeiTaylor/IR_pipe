Maps of these visitations generated by a troubled international data broker with defense industry ties, discovered last week by WIRED, document the numerous trips of wealthy and influential individuals seemingly undeterred by Epstein\u2019s . The data amassed by Near Intelligence, a location data broker roiled by allegations of mismanagement and fraud, reveals with high precision the residences of many guests of Little Saint James, a United States Virgin Islands property where Epstein is accused of having groomed, assaulted, and trafficked countless women and girls. Some girls, prosecutors say, were as young as 14. The former attorney general of the US Virgin Islands alleged that girls were trafficked to Epstein by those within his elite social circle. The coordinates that Near Intelligence collected and left exposed online pinpoint locations to within a few centimeters of space. Visitors were tracked as they moved from the Ritz-Carlton on neighboring St. Thomas Island, for instance, to a specific dock at the American Yacht Harbor\u2014a marina once co-owned by Epstein that hosts an \u201c\u201d of pleasure boats and mega-yachts. The data pinpointed their movements as they were transported to Epstein\u2019s dock on Little St. James, revealing the exact routes taken to the island. The tracking continued after they arrived. From inside Epstein's enigmatic to the pristine beaches, pools, and cabanas scattered across his 71-acres of prime archipelagic real estate, the data compiled by Near captures the movements of scores of people who sojourned at Little St. James as early as July 2016. The recorded surveillance concludes on July 6, 2019\u2014the day of Epstein\u2019s final arrest. * * * Got a tip? _If ... [Content truncated]",

Epstein\u2019s finances, once the subject of mystery and speculation, are being laid bare as various parties, including those who were sexually abused by the multimillionaire, stake their claims to a portion of his assets. The 100-page document from Epstein\u2019s estate included a listing of 15 wholly owned limited liability companies, which are designed to disclose little public information and were valued at $201.5 million. These LLCs include Southern Financial, LLC, valued at just under $180 million. The company was not described and does not appear to have been referred to in any prior documents. A footnote said the entity \u201cwill be appraised, and an updated value will be provided upon completion.\u201d It was not clear if the company was connected to Southern Country International, a similarly named Epstein company whose existence was first revealed by McClatchy/Miami Herald. A subsequent New York Times story determined that Southern Country International was a new, one-of-a-kind bank in the Virgin Islands that could do business only with offshore clients. Although Epstein owned the \u201cbank,\u201d it did not appear in the public-facing online licensing registries in the Virgin Islands. Concern about how Epstein funds were being documented has led to Virgin Islands Attorney General Denise George placing liens on the estate. Just last week, the executors of the estate complained in a court filing that checks to those maintaining his properties were beginning to bounce because of the liens. Epstein\u2019s estate includes 10 corporate entities that were wholly owned by him, valued at $426.2 million. The most valuable of these was Southern Trust Company Inc. ... [Content truncated]",

The trove of papers filed in Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre\u2019s 2015 defamation suit against the dead included references to Prince Andrew, former President Bill Clinton and Stephen Hawking, among other major figures. The lengthy list of boldface names paints a troubling picture of Epstein\u2019s double life as an ace financier who used his wealth and connections to victimize dozens of young women. The 215 newly unsealed documents, nearly 5,000 pages, were released between Jan. 3 and Jan. 9 \u2014 , including victims and former employees. Many case records had previously come out but had been heavily redacted. Before the document dump, online sleuths speculated about who might be named. Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, for instance, did not appear in the documents, but was forced to defend himself from trolls in the hours before the formal release began. Here are all the A-listers who appeared in the newly revealed documents: **Prince Andrew** ----------------- In addition to Giuffre\u2019s allegations she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew while underage, the documents reveal additional claims \u2013 including that he allegedly participated in an \u201cunderage orgy.\u201d ] Virginia Giuffre (center) claims Prince Andrew had sex with her when she was a minor.

There, the victims were \u201cdeceptively subjected to sexual servitude, forced to engage in sexual acts and coerced into commercial sexual activity and forced labor,\u201d the lawsuit says.

The lawsuit says that flight logs and other sources established that the enterprise stretched from 2001 to 2019. As recently as 2018, the lawsuit says, air traffic controllers and other airport personnel reported seeing Epstein leave his plane with young girls who appeared to be between 11 and 18 years old. The scheme described in the suit is remarkably similar to the accusations in Epstein\u2019s federal criminal case unveiled last July. In that case, prosecutors said the secretive multi-millionaire ran a sex trafficking enterprise between 2002 and 2005 at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida.
