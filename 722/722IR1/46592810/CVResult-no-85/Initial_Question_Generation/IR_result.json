One woman who was 16 or 17 at the time said she had no massage experience and no assumption or expectation that the visit would involve sexual activity. “Jeffrey took my clothes off without my consent the first time I met him,” according to a transcript of a deposition from the woman, whose name has been redacted. Former Palm Beach police Det. Joseph Recarey, who is now deceased, said in 2016 that Ghislaine Maxwell, , was involved in seeking girls to give massages and work at Epstein’s home. Recarey said he interviewed around 33 women, according to a transcript. Only two, who were older, had any massage experience, he said. Most of the girls were younger than 18. \"Each of the victims that went to the home were asked to bring their friends to the home. Some complied and some didn’t,\" Recarey said.

Nineteen exhibits totaling 327 pages of previously sealed documents were released Thursday by a federal court in New York.

        "Question": "Does the video evidence confirm it was filmed on Jeffrey Epstein's island?",
        "Answer": "The video evidence does not confirm that it was filmed on Jeffrey Epstein's island. Here are the reasons:\n\n1. **Lack of Direct Evidence Linking the Location**: The video showcases a little girl playing in what appears to be a luxurious indoor setting, but the architectural details and context do not provide any definitive indicators that it is Joseph Epstein's island, Little Saint James. The absence of identifiable features that are clearly recognizable from Jeffrey Epstein's property means that there is no conclusive proof linking the video to the island.\n\n2. **Fact-Check Findings**: According to a review published by Yahoo News, which focused on examining such claims, the viral video was scrutinized, but the findings did not support the assertion that it was filmed on Epstein's island. The existence of this fact-check suggests a lack of credible evidence confirming the location of the video as claimed [Query 1_evidence_2].\n\n3. **Context of Viral Claims**: The video is part of a larger narrative involving many misleading claims connected to Jeffrey Epstein. It has been noted that various videos and images related to Epstein garner attention, often lacking verifiable sources or accurate context.
