The names were unsealed from a lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre, an alleged trafficking victim, against British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend. Maxwell, 62, is serving a 20-year prison sentence after she was convicted in December 2021 of helping Epstein recruit and sexually abuse underage girls. Many of those whose names appear in the documents released on Wednesday aren't accused of wrongdoing or have been mentioned previously in legal proceedings or news accounts. Despite persistent assertions across social media, the documents released on Wednesday are not an Epstein \"client list.\" In December, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska found no legal justification for continuing to withhold the names of as many as 175 individuals allegedly connected with Epstein, ordering the unsealing to begin from January 1. Some portions of the records will remain confidential, including those identifying people who were children when they were sexually abused by Epstein, who died by suicide in August 2019 in a federal prison in Manhattan as he awaited trial on sex-trafficking charges. With the release of the names including a number of celebrities, a clip of comedian Gervais taking swipes at celebrities while hosting the 2020 Golden Globe Awards has been shared on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. As he stood before the crowd gathered in Beverly Hills to toast TV and movie talent, five-time host Gervais said: \"In this room are some of the most important TV and film executives in the world, from all different backgrounds. But they all have one thing in common\u2014they're all terrified of Ronan Farrow. ... [Content truncated]",

The trove of papers filed in Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre\u2019s 2015 defamation suit against the dead included references to Prince Andrew, former President Bill Clinton and Stephen Hawking, among other major figures. The lengthy list of boldface names paints a troubling picture of Epstein\u2019s double life as an ace financier who used his wealth and connections to victimize dozens of young women. The 215 newly unsealed documents, nearly 5,000 pages, were released between Jan. 3 and Jan. 9 \u2014 , including victims and former employees.

Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, for instance, did not appear in the documents, but was forced to defend himself from trolls in the hours before the formal release began. Here are all the A-listers who appeared in the newly revealed documents: **Prince Andrew** ----------------- In addition to Giuffre\u2019s allegations she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew while underage, the documents reveal additional claims \u2013 including that he allegedly participated in an \u201cunderage orgy.\u201d ] Virginia Giuffre (center) claims Prince Andrew had sex with her when she was a minor.
