                    "content": "Advertisement Supported by By Steve Eder ST. THOMAS, V.I. — Jeffrey Epstein once described the United States Virgin Islands as “my favorite place to be.” When he was there, Mr. Epstein had a knack for getting his way, according to public records and interviews with residents and local officials. Mr. Epstein, the accused sex trafficker who committed suicide in a Manhattan jail this month, used these islands as a personal and corporate hideaway, negotiating lucrative local tax breaks even as he faced federal investigations for sexual misconduct. He cultivated close ties to the islands’ political and financial elite. He employed a governor’s wife. He hired an architecture firm owned by that governor’s uncle. He donated money, sponsored scholarships and even gave dozens of computers to a local lawmaker to distribute. The islands became a haven for Mr. Epstein. His private plane would fly him to St. Thomas’s international airport, where he would board a helicopter that whisked him to his Little St. James and Great St. James islands. Once there, he was known to entertain famous friends and, his accusers have said in court filings, traffic underage girls for sex. While federal authorities spent years criminally investigating Mr. Epstein, a spokesman for the local police department said it had no records of having visited his Virgin Islands properties.
