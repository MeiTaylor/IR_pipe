The text of this review is spoiler-free and the video/screenshots shown are from early on in the campaign, but keep that in mind if you haven't watched the show yet and would prefer to go in entirely blind. While Stranger Things obviously oozes '80s nostalgia, Stranger Things 3: The Game reminds me distinctly of the 2000\u2019s, bearing many of the hallmarks of the bygone licensed tie-in games of that era. As an old-school arcade beat-em-up with a free-flowing open world structure, its story, characters, and ideas are all tied directly to the third season of the Netflix show that inspired it, sometimes to a fault. Though it is better than many of the C-tier SpongeBob SquarePants, Rugrats, and Scooby Doo games that gave tie-ins a bad reputation, Stranger Things 3: The Game is still very much an addendum to the new season: It is not the best way to experience Stranger Things, and it's a pretty blas\u00e9 game experience if you don't have any love for the franchise, but those who do may find something to enjoy in it. Without going into spoiler territory, the story in Stranger Things 3: The Game feels like an abridged version of the story told throughout season 3. Though its roughly 8-hour campaign has more detail than you'd get watching a recap or reading a well-written wiki summary, it should surprise no one to hear that this version lacks the same emotional punch as the show. However, it does stick close enough to that script that I would strongly urge people to watch the new season before even turning it on.

While that\u2019s not exactly a concept unique to music, it is a practice I couldn\u2019t help but be reminded of while playing Inscryption \u2013 an undoubtedly odd connection to make, given that it presents itself as a horror-themed roguelite deck-building card game. But dig beneath that somewhat familiar shell and it reveals itself to be nothing short of a symphony of exciting twists, clever concepts, and consistently surprising iterations on the fundamentals that hooked me in its very first minutes. Inscryption holds much more than meets the eye, and a lot of what's so impressive about it are the unexpected places it ends up taking you. That means getting into many of the specific moments that make it so special will blunt their impact to a certain degree, so I am going to try to keep this review as spoiler-free as I can \u2013 both in terms of its story and some of its mechanics. That said, you only have to watch its to understand that this isn\u2019t just another \\-inspired entry into a genre that has begun to feel a little too derivative recently. In fact, it manages to partially live in that genre while simultaneously tearing it to pieces. Much like developer Daniel Mullins Games\u2019 iconic , Inscryption plays with meta themes in more ways than one. In this case, you start off playing a roguelike card game against a mysterious adversary shrouded in darkness, but the overall structure isn\u2019t ... [Content truncated]",

It\u2019s grainy and raw, a fair description of this four-part documentary, which squarely focuses on the story from the alleged victims\u2019 perspective. As constructed, there are some initial drawbacks to that. Director Lisa Bryant \u2013 working with among others author (and former Epstein neighbor) James Patterson, who wrote a book on the case \u2013 presents material in a non-linear way, which proves a trifle disorienting. Stay with it, though, and \u201cFilthy Rich\u201d coalesces into a maddening tale not only of how Epstein allegedly preyed upon teenagers, but an indictment of a system and institutions that missed opportunities to intervene. What the Netflix docu-series accomplishes most effectively is to capture the helplessness that survivors of Epstein\u2019s abuse say they felt. In that regard, it\u2019s a close companion to \u201cSurviving R. Kelly,\u201d thematically as well as in its format. Beyond his enormous wealth, private jets and lavish estates, Epstein interacted with other rich and famous people, including Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Prince Andrew and Harvey Weinstein. Moreover, he flaunted those connections, while seeking out girls from disadvantaged or troubled backgrounds and allegedly exploiting those vulnerabilities. The introductory hour focuses on a Vanity Fair piece commissioned to answer the seemingly innocuous question of who Epstein was and how he amassed his fortune. Reporter Vicky Ward\u2019s work, however, exposed allegations of sexual assault that ultimately didn\u2019t find their way into the 2003 article \u2013 to her stated frustration, and for reasons that the magazine disputes. (Ward is now a senior reporter at CNN.) The documentary unfolds along those lines, as Epstein allegedly leveraged his wealth to escape legal repercussions. That includes the \u201csweetheart deal\u201d ... [Content truncated]",

It was a lovely Saturday morning, and I was surprised by how many people had decided to spend it touring a sewage treatment operation. The crowd was so big that we had to be divided into groups. My group first watched a video, which explained that the plant\u2019s effluent would be released into the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, a thirty-mile-long waterway built in the late nineteenth century to rid the city of its ordure. After the video, we boarded a bus that shuttled us around the 413-acre complex. I was particularly struck by the aerated grit tanks, in which swirled a revolting brown liquid that resembled chocolate milk left out too long in the sun. At the tour\u2019s conclusion, we all received goody bags containing a pair of plastic sunglasses and a postcard that cheerily proclaimed, \u201cI followed the flush to the Stickney Water Reclamation Plant, the largest wastewater treatment plant in the world.\u201d I thought about my visit to Stickney several times while reading Lina Zeldovich\u2019s _The Other Dark Matter_. Zeldovich, a journalist who now lives in New York, grew up in Russia, about five hundred miles east of Moscow. Her family had a small farm on the outskirts of the city of Kazan, and the farm had a small septic tank. Every fall her grandfather would don a hazmat suit and empty the contents of the tank into buckets. Then he would pour the glop around the tomato plants, under the apple trees, and into holes he dug in the strawberry patch. \u201cMy grandfather wouldn\u2019t let all those riches go to waste,\u201d she explains. In the spring, there would be more tomatoes, apples, and juicy red strawberries. The experience ... [Content truncated]",

By June 8, 2020 ! Photo by Mary Cybulski / Universal Pictures Save Save How much are you rooting for **Pete Davidson**? Your answer to that question will greatly affect how much you enjoy the _Saturday Night Live_ comedian and gossip-page lightning rod\u2019s new film, _The King of Staten Island_\u2014once supposed to be the crown jewel premiere of SXSW ahead of a big theatrical release, now available to rent at home on June 12. The film is directed by **Judd Apatow**, who here tries to do for Davidson what he did for **Seth Rogen** with _Knocked Up_: to make the affable if irksome stoner with a heart of bronze a movie star on his own terms. If you\u2019re really in the tank for Davidson, _The King of Staten Island_ might deliver. If you\u2019re a bit more circumspect, it will prove less than persuasive. _The King of Staten Island_ is at least loosely biographical\u2014Davidson, like his character, Scott, is from that faraway borough, and his father was also a firefighter killed in the line of duty (Davidson\u2019s on September 11, Scott\u2019s at an apartment fire). Which means the movie is essentially a direct selling of the Davidson brand. It\u2019s a film heavily reliant on innate charm, a risky endeavor for any movie and even more so when that charm offensive lasts for 135 minutes. For me, ... [Content truncated]",
