Epstein's island, officially known as Little Saint James, is situated between St. Thomas and St. John, two of the largest islands of the US Virgin Islands in the Caribbean.

The building, shaped like a giant box and initially topped with a gold dome, has fueled rampant speculation and online conspiracy theories. Drawings supplied by Epstein's architects to the U.S. Virgin Islands agency that oversees coastal development show that it was designed to be a haven for music: an octagonal 3,500-square-foot pavilion housing a grand piano. But questions remain over whether it was built according to the plans that were submitted to the Department of Planning and Natural Resources. Those 2010 plans, which were part of a permit application that raised concerns inside the agency, included drawings of a building that looks almost nothing like the structure that was built. ! The plans for the pavilion, top, called for a different design than what was completed, bottom.Obtained by NBC News The drawings show a building with a 10-foot facade, stone exterior and multiple windows on the front. The structure that was erected has no windows or stone exterior on its front and appears to rise at least 30 feet. One Department of Planning and Natural Resources official acknowledged that there were differences. \"The major difference seems to be in the shape of the building itself,\" Marlon Hibbert said in response to an email request for comment, in which NBC News had provided a link to a photo of the odd-looking structure. \"In the link you provided the building looks rectangular and in the drawings it looked octagonal,\" he wrote.

THOMAS, V.I. \u2014 Jeffrey Epstein once described the United States Virgin Islands as \u201cmy favorite place to be.\u201d When he was there, Mr. Epstein had a knack for getting his way, according to public records and interviews with residents and local officials. Mr. Epstein, the accused sex trafficker who committed suicide in a Manhattan jail this month, used these islands as a personal and corporate hideaway, negotiating lucrative local tax breaks even as he faced federal investigations for sexual misconduct. He cultivated close ties to the islands\u2019 political and financial elite. He employed a governor\u2019s wife. He hired an architecture firm owned by that governor\u2019s uncle. He donated money, sponsored scholarships and even gave dozens of computers to a local lawmaker to distribute. The islands became a haven for Mr. Epstein. His private plane would fly him to St. Thomas\u2019s international airport, where he would board a helicopter that whisked him to his Little St. James and Great St. James islands. Once there, he was known to entertain famous friends and, his accusers have said in court filings, traffic underage girls for sex. While federal authorities spent years criminally investigating Mr. Epstein, a spokesman for the local police department said it had no records of having visited his Virgin Islands properties.
