    "QA": {
        "Question": "What do official records or reports say about the consumption of drinks during Kim Jong Un and Putin's toast?",
        "Answer": "Based on the available evidence and the information extracted from the official reports and credible sources, there seems to be a lack of verified information regarding the actual consumption of drinks during the toast between Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin at their summit. The online searches yielded no credible evidence to confirm whether they drank alcohol during the toast. One search explicitly notes that such information is not available and emphasizes the necessity of relying on reliable sources for verification. Therefore, it appears that while a toast did take place, the details regarding whether the drinks were consumed remain ambiguous and unverified. As such, definitive claims about the consumption of drinks during the toast cannot be substantiated based on the current evidence.",
