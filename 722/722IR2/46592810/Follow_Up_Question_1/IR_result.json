        "answer": "I found some relevant information to verify the authenticity of the viral video claiming to show young girls on Jeffrey Epstein's island. According to a fact-checking article by Snopes, the claim made in the viral video was unfounded. The video shared on social media allegedly showing \"very young girls\" on the late Jeffrey Epstein's island was investigated, and it was found to be misleading and not based on factual information[^4](https://twitter.com/snopes/status/1744802394137899171).\n\nAdditionally, another source indicates that the unsealing of documents related to Epstein reignited rumors about his past connections to former presidents and celebrities, but it did not confirm any new information about the sex trafficking scandal[^1](https://www.snopes.com/news/2024/01/12/jeffrey-epstein-misleading-rumors/).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided by Snopes and other sources, it can be concluded that the viral video claiming to show young girls on Jeffrey Epstein's island is not authentic and should be considered misleading."
