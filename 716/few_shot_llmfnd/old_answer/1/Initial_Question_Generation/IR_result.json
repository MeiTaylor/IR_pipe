The storm dropped heavy rains and created storm surges that caused flooding and led to inland rescues and evacuations. Many social media posts claim to show shocking images from the storm. The VERIFY team has been fact-checking viral content to determine what‚Äôs real and what isn‚Äôt. Was an elephant seal seen scooting along a Florida sidewalk during Hurricane Ian? Florida just outta control right now üò≥ü¶≠ pic.twitter.com/LSJMf3bnIt The video, posted to Twitter on Sept. 28, had more than 12 million views. No, an elephant seal was not seen scooting along a Florida sidewalk during Hurricane Ian. The elephant seal video was taken in October 2020 in Puerto Cisnes, Chile. According to Infobae, an Argentinian news outlet, the elephant seal traveled 10 blocks in an area known as the largest urban center in the city of Puerto Cisnes, Chile. With the help of residents in the area, the seal was transported back to the ocean by the Chilean navy. The rescue mission was recorded live on Facebook in October 2020 by a local radio DJ.

When a hurricane hits Florida people do a party pic.twitter.com/B4Vaas2SFD The video clip, shared by multiple accounts on Sept. 28, had hundreds of thousands of views on Twitter. It had more than 1 million likes on TikTok. No, the video wasn‚Äôt taken during Ian. It was shared online multiple times before the storm made landfall in Florida, though it was taken in Fort Myers, Florida. Using RevEye, a reverse image search tool, VERIFY found several instances where the video was shared prior to Ian becoming a named storm. The video was posted on Reddit on Aug. 30. This 12-second video was posted to Facebook on Sept. 12. It was also posted on Imgur, an image and video sharing platform, on Sept. 15, about a week and a half before Ian made landfall. Using Google Maps Streetview, VERIFY was able to pinpoint the exact location where the video was taken ‚Äì from the rooftop of the Lani Kai Island Resort in Fort Myers Beach. The same buildings seen in the video can be seen from Google Maps. The same 7-11 convenience store can be seen across the street from the Lani Kai resort where the video was taken, and right across the street from that, the same blue building. Does this photo show a shark swimming on a Florida highway in Ian‚Äôs floodwaters? There are sharks on the highways in Florida. Unreal. pic.twitter.com/sHcgfkrc8o The photo, posted to Twitter on Sept. 28, had more than 28,000 retweets and over 300,000 likes. This photo circulates nearly each hurricane season. This example was shared in 2018 in connection to Hurricane Florence, which wreaked havoc on the Carolinas. Here it was shared during Hurricane Sandy, and here during Hurricane Irma. The image was actually lifted from a September 2005 issue of Africa Geographic. The original photo shows a shark trailing a kayaker, and was later manipulated to look like a shark was swimming through an interstate lane. Were zoo flamingos really moved to a basement bathroom ahead of the storm? Flamingos evacuated to the bathroom at Sunken Gardens, St Pete.ü¶©ü¶© #hurricaneian pic.twitter.com/MX9wNGvzds Some people commenting on the photo claimed they had seen that image before the storm struck Florida on Sept. 28. This one is real! The flamingos are residents of Sunken Gardens park, a botanic park based out of St. Petersburg, Florida. The park tweeted the photo from their official account on Sept. 28, saying the flamingos were safe from the oncoming storm. ‚ÄúWe're hunkered down! Our animals are safe w/staff on site to see them through the storm. The flamingos are having a hurricane party in the bathroom; eating, drinking, & dancing.

In August 1992, Hurricane Andrew, a Category 5 storm, hit Florida and at the time, Miami Zoo‚Äôs Ron Magill took a photo of flamingos huddled up. On the 30 year anniversary of Hurricane Andrew, Magill tweeted about the famous photo, writing, ‚ÄúOf the countless images I have captured in my life, none is more iconic than this one.

If you have a question you‚Äôd like an expert to answer, send it to curiouskidsus@theconversation.com. How can I tell if what I am hearing is true? ‚Äì Adam, age 10, Maui, Hawaii Have you ever heard a story so exciting you wanted to share it right away? Something like a shark swimming up a flooded highway? An image that seems to show just that was shared by many people after Hurricane Ian struck Florida in 2022. It was also widely shared after Hurricane Harvey hit Houston, Texas, in 2017. It‚Äôs a fake ‚Äì a flooded highway image combined with one of a great white shark. The fact-checking website Snopes found it circulating as far back as 2011 after Hurricane Irene slammed Puerto Rico. Truth can be tricky to determine. Every message you read, see or hear comes from somewhere and was created by someone and for someone. I teach media literacy, which is a way to think about information you get in the messages you receive via media. You might think media means the news, but it also includes TikTok posts, television, books, advertisements and more. When deciding whether to trust a piece of information, it‚Äôs good to start with three main questions ‚Äì who said it, what evidence did they give and how much do you want to believe it? The last one might seem a little strange, but you‚Äôll see why it‚Äôs important by the end. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre really excited about a game that‚Äôs coming out later this year. You want to be the first to learn about the new creatures, characters and game modes. So when a YouTube video pops up saying, ‚ÄúGAME COMING TWO WEEKS EARLY,‚Äù you can‚Äôt wait to watch. But when you click, it‚Äôs just a guy making predictions. Do you trust him? A source is where information comes from. You get information from sources every day ‚Äì from teachers, parents and friends to people you‚Äôve never met on news sites, fan channels and social media. You probably have sources you trust and ones you don‚Äôt. But why? Would you trust your history teacher to tell you something about history? Probably, because they have a college degree that says they know their stuff. But what if your history teacher told you a fact about science your science teacher said was untrue? You‚Äôd probably be better off going with the science teacher for your science facts. Just because a source is trustworthy in one subject doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre trustworthy in every subject. Let‚Äôs go back to the YouTuber. If you‚Äôve watched him for a while and he‚Äôs reliably correct, that‚Äôs a good start. At the same time, make sure you don‚Äôt confuse his having an opinion with actually having knowledge. Just because you like a source doesn‚Äôt make it trustworthy. This is true for websites, too. When a site grabs your attention, take a second to check the source at the top. Some fake sites use names that sound trustworthy ‚Äì like ‚ÄúBoston Tribune‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúBoston Globe‚Äù or ‚Äúwww.cbs.com.co‚Äù instead of ‚Äúwww.cbs.com.‚Äù You can click the ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù page to see where they‚Äôre really coming from, use lists of known fake sites and other fact-checking resources to avoid getting played. Evidence is what you show when someone says ‚Äúprove it!‚Äù It‚Äôs the details that support what a source is saying. Primary sources ‚Äì people or groups who are directly involved with the information ‚Äì are best. If you want to learn about the release of a new game, the company‚Äôs official accounts or channels would be primary sources. Secondary sources are one step removed ‚Äì for example, news stories based on primary sources. They aren‚Äôt as strong as primary sources but are still useful. For example, most news on gaming site IGN is based on information from game company sources, so it‚Äôs a good secondary source. Can a blogger or YouTuber be a secondary source? If their claims start by referencing primary sources like ‚ÄúElectronic Arts says,‚Äù that‚Äôs good. But if they start with ‚ÄúI think‚Äù or ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of buzz,‚Äù be careful. Emotions can get in the way of knowing what‚Äôs true. Messages that make you feel strong emotions ‚Äì especially ones that are funny or make you angry ‚Äì are the most important ones to check, but they‚Äôre also the hardest to ignore. Advertisers know this. Many ads try to be funny or make the things they‚Äôre selling look cool because they want you to focus on how you feel rather than what you think. And being older doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre automatically better at spotting false information: 41% of 18-to-34-year-olds and 44% of adults 65 and older admitted to having fallen for a fake news story in a 2018 study. Other research showed adults over 65 were seven times as likely to share articles from fake sites as younger people were. So if you‚Äôve been eagerly waiting for that new game, and somebody posts a video that says it‚Äôs coming out early, your wanting it to be true can make you ignore your common sense ‚Äì leaving you open to being fooled. The best question you can ask yourself when you‚Äôre thinking about a message is, ‚ÄúDo I want to believe this?‚Äù If the answer is yes, it‚Äôs a good sign you should slow down and check the source and evidence more closely. Hello, curious kids! Do you have a question you‚Äôd like an expert to answer? Ask an adult to send your question to CuriousKidsUS@theconversation.com.

                "content": "FOLLOW ON Advertisement Photos and videos of sharks and other marine life swimming in suburban floodwaters make for popular hoaxes during massive storms. But a cellphone video filmed during Hurricane Ian's assault on southwest Florida isn't just another fish story. The eye-popping video, which showed a large, dark fish with sharp dorsal fins thrashing around an inundated Fort Myers backyard, racked up more than 12 million views on Twitter within a day, as users responded with disbelief and comparisons to the \"Sharknado\" film series. Dominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer, confirmed he filmed the clip from his back patio Wednesday morning when he saw something \"flopping around\" in his neighbor's flooded yard. \"I didn't know what it was -- it just looked like a fish or something,\" he told The Associated Press. \"I zoomed in, and all my friends are like, 'It's like a shark, man!'\" He guessed the fish was about four feet (1.2 metres) in length. Experts were of mixed opinion on whether the clip showed a shark or another large fish. George Burgess, former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History's shark program, said in an email that it \"appears to be a juvenile shark,\" while Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, director of the University of Miami's shark conservation program, wrote that \"it's pretty hard to tell.\" Nevertheless, some Twitter users dubbed the hapless fish the \"street shark.\" The surge worsened in Fort Myers as the day went on. Cameratta said the flooding had only just begun when the clip was taken, but that the waters were \"all the way up to our house\" by the time the AP reached him by phone Wednesday evening. He said the fish may have made its way up from nearby Hendry Creek into a retention pond, which then overflowed, spilling the creature into his neighbor's backyard. A visual analysis of nearby property confirmed it matches the physical landmarks in the video. Leslie Guelcher, a professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, was among the online sleuths who initially thought the video was fake. \"Don't think this is real. According to the index on the video it was created in June 2010. Someone else posted it at 10 AM as in Fort Myers, but the storm surge wasn't like that at 10 AM,\" she tweeted Wednesday. Guelcher acknowledged later, though, that online tools she and others were using to establish the video's origins didn't actually show when the video itself was created, merely when the social media profile of the user was created. The AP confirmed through the original clip's metadata that it was captured Wednesday morning. \"It makes a bit more sense from a flooding standpoint,\" she said by email, when informed the fish was spotted near an overflowing pond. \"But how on earth would a shark go from the Gulf of Mexico to a retention pond?\" Yannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, said that most sharks flee shallow bays ahead of hurricanes, possibly tipped off to their arrival by a change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he said, or been washed into it. \"Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters -- rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments -- and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,\" Burgess said. \"Assuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.\" Cameratta sent the video to a group chat on WhatsApp on Wednesday morning, according to his friend John Paul Murray, who sent the AP a timestamped screenshot. \"Amazing content,\" Murray wrote in reply. ------ Associated Press writers Philip Marcelo and Arijeta Lajka in New York contributed to this report.

George Burgess, a former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History‚Äôs shark program, told the Washington Post that the fish in the video appears to be a juvenile shark. ‚ÄúYoung bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters ‚Äî rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments ‚Äî and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,‚Äù Burgess said. ‚ÄúAssuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.‚Äù\n‚ÄúYoung bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters ‚Äî rivers, estuaries, subtropical ... [+] embayments ‚Äî and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,‚Äù Burgess says.\nDr. Yannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, is on the fence about the video. Papastamatiou pointed to the science that shows many shark species are known to flee shallow, coastal regions ahead of hurricanes, possibly being tipped off to the giant storm‚Äôs arrival by a drastic change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he reckons, or been washed into it.\nBut Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami‚Äôs shark conservation program, isn‚Äôt as convinced, saying it was difficult to tell what exactly the fish was. It should be of note that the video caught the fish swimming near a pond that was overflowing, causing some experts to lean towards this just being an escapee.\nIt seems we will never have a definitive answer to this mystery. While shark experts are split over the identification, some Twitter users were convinced and have dubbed the grainy fish a ‚Äústreet shark.‚Äù Perhaps this is a new rendition for ‚ÄúBaby Shark‚Äù writers to pick up and write a song about?\n\nOne Community.
