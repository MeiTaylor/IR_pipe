                    "content": "Numerous human activities and natural events and processes affect the condition of natural and maritime heritage (archaeological) resources in marine sanctuaries. This section describes the nature and extent of the most prominent pressures in Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, many of which originate outside its boundaries. Pressures on Water Quality Water quality is a key element that unites all sanctuary resources and is essential to maintaining the richness and diversity of its varied environments. Water quality is both a spatial and temporal phenomenon and can be affected by both natural and anthropogenic influences. Under certain conditions, external sources adjacent to the sanctuary (e.g., Gulf of Mexico Loop Current and Florida Current, land based activities, and atmospheric inputs) can dominate water quality patterns. Pressures on water quality in the sanctuary are described below: Figure 11. Sewer pipes are being placed in the ground throughout the Florida Keys to carry wastewater to advanced wastewater treatment plants being constructed throughout the keys.(Photo: NOAA/FKNMS) Point Sources of Pollution and Contamination Point source pollution results when a pollutant is discharged directly into surface waters from a definite location, such as the pipes of industrial waste facilities or domestic sewage treatment plants. Pollutants can be natural substances, like nutrients, that are present in unusually high quantities due to human influence. Contaminants are typically chemicals not found normally in the environment such as industrial chemicals, pesticides, PCBs, and other toxicants. Point source pollution can also include discharge resulting from urban stormwater runoff if coming from a drainage pipe. The effects of point source effluents on receiving surface waters may include the introduction of additional flow, increased microbial abundance, suspended sediments, nutrients (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus), metals, and organic compounds. In the Florida Keys, wastewater and stormwater treatment and solid-waste disposal facilities were highly inadequate, directly affecting nearshore water quality (Kruczynski and McManus 2002). When the sanctuary was designated in 1990, there were 19 facilities actively discharging effluent directly into nearshore waters, including water treatment plants, power plants, a desalination plant, and other industrial facilities (NOAA 1996). Today, Monroe County and local municipalities are undergoing extensive upgrades in wastewater infrastructure that provide advanced wastewater treatment, significantly reducing wastewater impacts and pressures in the area (Figure 11). Nonpoint Sources of Pollution Unlike point source pollution, nonpoint source pollution comes from many diffuse sources. Nonpoint source water pollution is usually due to rainfall moving over and through the ground and carrying various chemicals. As the runoff moves, it picks up and carries away pollutants, finally depositing them into surface and subsurface (groundwater) waters. Pollutants and contaminants include excess fertilizers, herbicides, and insecticides from agricultural lands and residential areas; oil, grease, and toxic chemicals from urban runoff and energy production; sediment from improperly managed construction sites and dredging operations; bacteria and nutrients from birds and other wildlife: pet wastes; and faulty septic systems. Eutrophication (an outcome of excess nutrients in the water, such as fertilizers) of nearshore waters has been an ongoing, documented problem in the nearshore waters of the Florida Keys. The process of eutrophication has the potential to shift primary productivity from the slower-growing flora (e.g., seagrasses) to faster-growing species (e.g., macroalgae and microalgae). In time, eutrophication may result in a shift from one type of biological community to one that is adapted to the higher-nutrient conditions (Fourqurean et al. 2003, Wagner et al. 2008). Because they are generally more soluble than toxicants such as oil and lipid-soluble contaminants, nutrient and organic inputs may affect the environment over a greater spatial area. In addition, while toxicants affect localized environments such as marinas, canals, and areas surrounding industry, nutrients are more susceptible to transport and represent a greater threat to seagrass and coral reef communities (NOAA 1996). Residential canals in the Florida Keys were often dug too deep, and the length and complexity of the residential canal systems also limit flushing with nearshore waters of the sanctuary. They frequently experience microalgal blooms and have anaerobic sediments containing accumulated chemicals and organic matter. While some studies have been conducted, the exact extent to which residential canals affect sanctuary waters has not been fully studied at this time (Chesher 1974, Lapointe and Clark 1990 and 1992). Domestic wastewater from illegal cesspits and outdated septic systems has been contributing to nonpoint source pollution in the Keys, but is expected to decline due to improvements being made in wastewater treatment, which involves decommissioning the septic systems and cesspits. Other sources of nonpoint source pollution include abandoned landfills, marinas and live-aboard vessels (collectively), and stormwater runoff (NOAA 1996). Figure 12. The Florida Department of Health posts swimming advisories at beaches throughout the Florida Keys. This sign indicates if it is advisable or not to swim due to water quality issues such as fecal coliform levels.(Photo: NOAA/FKNMS) Swimming Advisories Runoff and spills have periodically resulted in high levels of fecal coliform and enterococci bacteria in the Florida Keys, resulting in swimming advisories for nearshore waters and beaches (Figure 12). Enterococci bacteria and fecal coliform bacteria are often used as indicator organisms in nearshore water quality monitoring, and while they may not cause diseases in humans, their presence can indicate that water may be contaminated with organisms that cause human health impacts such as fever, flu-like symptoms, ear infection, respiratory illness, rashes, gastroenteritis, cryptosporidiosis, and hepatitis. Sources of polluted and contaminated water include runoff from urban, suburban and rural areas, aging sewer infrastructure systems pressed to meet increasing demands, and contaminated flows from other upland sources. Contributing factors that generate these sources include illicit storm drain connections, improper disposal of materials or maintenance that clog pipes and cause overflows, cracked or damaged pipes, overflow of sewer systems during storm events, septic system leaching, and various domestic and wildlife sources. External Input External sources of pollutants and contaminants also affect the sanctuary's water quality. Examples of this input could include Florida Bay, Biscayne Bay and canal structures operated by the local water management district. Additionally, the sanctuary is considered downstream of currents in the region, like the Loop ... [Content truncated]",

                    "content": "Hurricanes are capable of affecting almost everything in their paths. Their strong winds and heavy rains can directly impact both inland and coastal areas in short periods that usually last about a day. Understanding the effects of hurricanes is the first step to preparing for these weather events. Hurricanes can have extensive and potentially permanent effects on whole ecosystems. Many efforts have been made to develop ways to accurately predict, effectively prepare for, and quickly recover from hurricanes; however, the storms' sizes and complexity make this difficult. Multidisciplinary collaborations are required to improve our understanding of hurricanes. This document reviews basic facts about hurricanes and their effects in Florida and discusses ways they might affect Florida's agriculture and natural resources. Examples in this document demonstrate how weather, agriculture, environment, and ecosystem are connected to each other across spatial scales ranging from microorganisms to an entire landscape. Hurricanes are large, swirling tropical storms that develop over warm ocean water. Hurricanes affecting Florida usually form in the Atlantic Ocean from June to November when the trade winds are able to carry them west or northwest at a speed of 10 to 15 miles per hour (NOAA 2017a). Once hurricanes reach the latitudes of 25Â° to 30Â°N (the subtropical ridge), the westerlies usually drive them northeast (NOAA 2017d). The scientific name for a hurricane is a tropical cyclone, also known as a typhoon when it develops in the North Pacific Ocean. Ocean water holds heat, which is released when water vapor evaporates from the ocean surface. This is called latent heat, and it fuels the formation and travel of tropical cyclones. Hurricanes are categorized by the sustained speed of their winds based on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (NOAA 2017c). Hurricanes in Category 3, Category 4, and Category 5 are major hurricanes. Although hurricanes are commonly associated with rainfall, the rainfall characteristics are not considered in the classification of hurricanes, presumably due to the difficulty of making accurate remote estimations of rainfall. Hurricanes consist of the eye, eyewall, and rainbands (Figure 2). The eye is the hurricane center where skies are clear with light winds. The location of the eye is used as a reference point to track hurricanes (Figure 1). The eyewall consists of the strongest winds and thunderstorm clouds and is the most destructive part. Rainbands are long, curved groups of clouds and thunderstorms that stretch for hundreds of miles (NOAA 1999) from the eye, and they sometimes contain very strong wind and tornadoes, especially on the east side of the eye. The winds and rainfall weaken between bands compared to within a band. NOAA National Hurricane Center names hurricanes and tropical storms using established lists that follow the procedures maintained and updated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) (NOAA 2017e). Names are reused every six years, but the names of extremely destructive storms such as Andrew are retired. The main purpose of naming hurricanes is to facilitate clear and quick communications among people, institutes, stations, and bases, which is why the names are usually short, distinctive, and easy to pronounce (NOAA 2017f). Hurricane landfalls are frequent in Florida, making it one of the most hurricane-affected states. Since 1851, 898 hurricanes have formed in the Atlantic Ocean, with 322 classified as major hurricanes (NOAA 2017b). The number of hurricanes has increased slightly, but with fluctuations (Figure 3). Of the 898 hurricanes, 289 made landfall on the coast of the US, and 120 of them (36 major hurricanes) affected parts of Florida (Figure 4). The data indicate that Florida has been affected by a hurricane every 1.38 years (every year to two years) on average. Since 1900, Florida has had a total of approximately $526 billion (2005 USD) worth of hurricane damage, which is equal to that of the rest of the US (Pielke, Jr. et al. 2008). Major hurricanes caused 87% of the damage. The Great Miami hurricane of 1926 caused an estimated $157 billion (2005 USD) worth of damage. It is followed by Katrina in 2005 ($81 billion), Galveston ($78 billion in 1900), another Galveston ($62 billion in 1915), and Andrew ($58 billion in 1992). Florida is also the state that has been the most frequently damaged (25 times) by the top 50 devastating hurricanes, followed by Texas (11 times) and North Carolina (eight times). Hurricanes cause loss of life as well as property damages. Large amounts of rainfall brought by the 1928 Lake Okeechobee hurricane, one of the most devastating Atlantic hurricanes on record, damaged the earthen dam of Lake Okeechobee and caused extensive flooding in its downstream areas, resulting in 2,400 deaths (Blake 1980). Hurricanes can affect a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems as well as the associated ecosystem services, or benefits people obtain from nature to improve their livelihood. In terrestrial ecosystems, the strong wind generated by the hurricane can substantially affect the structure and functioning of coastal forest and wetland ecosystems, including upland forests, mangrove swamps, hardwood hammocks, sawgrass, and forested wetlands. Because of the proximity of these ecosystems to coastlines, these ecosystems often sustain dramatic damages from hurricane winds. Impacts often include uprooting of trees and complete removal of leaves and branches. Besides direct wind impacts, storm surges can also transport large amounts of saline water and sediment inland, which can lead to additional physiological stresses (salinity or oxygen) to plants. In 1992, for example, Hurricane Andrew in south Florida caused significant damage to the mangrove forests of the Everglades (Roman et al. 1994), with almost 100% visual structural damage observed and about 60% of the trees uprooted or broken due to combined effects of high wind speed and tidal surges. The loss of mangrove forests leads to loss of carbon that is released to the atmosphere, destabilization of shorelines, and reduction of critical habitats for many endangered species (e.g., Key deer, American crocodiles, hawksbill sea turtles, etc.). Moreover, changes in abiotic conditions (such as light, temperature, and humidity) due to losses of forest canopy can also have profound implications for other species ... [Content truncated]",

They are not a complete record of all incidents which occurred in this park during this timeframe. April 14, 1987 87-43 - Gulf Islands - Auto Accident A one car accident which occurred in the park resulted in the death of Ms. L.C.C. June 3, 1987 87-88 - Gulf Islands - Drowning Location: Perdido Key A.H. was swimming at a non-guarded beach. A boater noticed A.H. to be having difficulty swimming. By the time the boater reached A.H. he had gone under the water's surface. The boater was able to grab A.H. and pull him into the boat. A.H. was taken to a guarded beach where the lifeguards performed CPR, but were unable to revive him. A.H. was medivaced by helicopter and was pronounced dead at the hospital. A.H.'s wife was on the beach and witnessed the incident. Autopsy to be performed. June 8, 1987 87-95 - Gulf Islands - Drowning Location: unknown At approximately 6:00pm on 6/7, park rangers received a report of 2 overdue swimmers. A search was initiated. At approximately 11:00pm two bodies were found. Details on the incident are few. The investigation is being turned over to the local sheriff's office. September 24, 1987 87-234 - Gulf Islands - Motor Vehicle Accident: Fatality Location: US Hiway 98 near Gulf Breeze Mr. J.W.B. was driving his 1987 Corvette at a high rate of speed when he lost control of his vehicle, became airborne and wrapped around a telephone pole. He was dead on arrival. May 9, 1988 88-77 - Gulf Islands - Fatality Location: Perdido Key One-year-old J.S. was left unattended and strapped in a stroller for about 5 minutes while her parents collected seashells. Her father reportedly looked back, noticed she was no longer in the stroller and found her floating in the surf. He grabbed the child, ran to the road and flagged a ranger. CPR was administered and the child was transported to the hospital where 2 hours of efforts failed to revive her. The child's stroller was about 30 feet from the surf, with crawl marks leading from it to the surf line. Escambia County Sheriff's Department is investigating. June 7, 1988 88-97 - Gulf Islands - Drug Arrests Location: Fort Pickens Campground On Monday, park rangers and Santa Rosa County Sheriffs arrested W.B.R. and L.G.R. just outside the park boundary on nine outstanding warrants. They had been camping with L.G.R.'s mother for most of the previous week at Fort Pickens campground, and were in the process of leaving in three vehicles when they were stopped. A search of the mother's vehicle led to the discovery of a suitcase containing 125.5 grams of cocaine, a small amount of marijuana, scales and other drug paraphenalia. W.B.R. had $3,100 in cash in his possession, and there were also pictures of L.G.R. standing in a marijuana field of unknown location. The Restuchers were arrested, and the mother was released. L.G.R. is being held without bond; W.B.R. is being held on a $100,000 bond. State prosecutors are trying to get federal charges placed against these persons, as there is evidence of dealing drugs on park property. June 14, 1988 88-101 - Gulf Islands - Drowning Location: Santa Rosa Island A park visitor observed B.M.K., 7, of Satsuma, Alabama, struggling in rough surf at an unguarded beach within the park. An NPS lifeguard at the guarded beach 1/4 mile away was notified and responded with rangers. At one point a park visitor attempting to rescue B.M.K. had him in hand only to have him knocked away by the surf. Search efforts are continuing today but are being hampered by extremely rough surf. Friday, February 10, 1989 89-17 - Gulf Islands - Suicide The body of a 26-year-old Springfield, Missouri, man was found on the afternoon of the 8th at Naval Live Oaks picnic area. The apparent cause of death was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. A weapon was found near his body along with a suicide note and a cassette tape in which he explained why he'd taken his own life. The park, FBI and Florida Department of Law Enforcement are investigating. (Carl Christensen, CR, GUIS, via SERO). Thursday, February 16, 1989 89-21 - Gulf Islands - Search/Drowning At 6 p.m. on February 13th, three young men were declared missing by authorities in Pensacola Beach, Florida. At 6:30 a.m. on the following morning, a park maintenance man found R.H., 11, wandering along the road near Naval Live Oaks visitor center. The boy said that he and two friends had left Pensacola Beach in a canoe with the objective of crossing Santa Rosa Sound, and capsized on the way. A search was begun by park rangers, and the body of T.L.A., age 9 or 10, was soon found near Naval Live Oaks. Another boy, J.M., age 8, was missing, and had not yet been found at the time of the report (4 p.m. on the 14th). Park rangers, local authorities and the Florida Marine Patrol are still searching for the missing boy. (Skip Prang, DR, GUTS, via SERO). Thursday, March 16, 1989 89-47 - Gulf Islands - MVA with Fatality On the afternoon of March 11th, a motorcycle collided with a car on Fort Pickens Road. The motorcyclist, 19-year-old E.R. of Gulf Breeze, Florida, was thrown from his bike and received a severe head injury. He was placed on life support systems, but died on the afternoon of the 13th. (Carl Christensen, CR, GUTS, via Bill Sturgeon, FAD/SERO). Friday, June 9, 1989 89-123 - Gulf Islands - Building Destruction and Employee Injury At 9:30 yesterday morning, a tornado completely destroyed the Fort Pickens entrance station at Gulf Islands. Seasonal ranger Amanda Rhodes, 26, who was in the building at the time, was taken to the hospital and treated for shock, bruises, cuts and a possible broken wrist.

Compelling cases of such effects have been documented, though few studies have confirmed population-level impacts on abundance or vital rates. While many of the observed effects had been predicted, some unforeseen and relatively acute consequences have also been documented. Effects often occur when climate-induced alterations are superimposed upon marine mammalsâ ecological (e.g., predator-prey) relationships or coincident human activities. As they were unanticipated, some of the unpredicted effects of climate change have strained the ability of existing conservation and management systems to respond effectively. The literature is replete with cases suggestive of cli",

                    "content": "Mangroves are survivors. With their roots submerged in water, mangrove trees thrive in hot, muddy, salty conditions that would quickly kill most plants. How do they do it? Through a series of impressive adaptationsâincluding a filtration system that keeps out much of the salt and a complex root system that holds the mangrove upright in the shifting sediments where land and water meet. Not only do mangroves manage to survive in challenging conditions, the mangrove ecosystem also supports an incredible diversity of creaturesâincluding some species unique to mangrove forests. And, as scientists are discovering, mangrove swamps are extremely important to our own well-being and to the health of the planet. The question is: Will mangroves be able to survive the impact of human activities? A mangrove is a woody tree or shrub that lives along sheltered coastlines within the tropic or subtropic latitudes. In fact, the various species of mangroves arenât necessarily closely related to one another, but they do share the unique capability of growing within reach of the tides in salty soil. Some mangrove species live so close to the shoreline that they are flooded with salt water every day as the tide comes in and submerges their roots. All mangroves have evolved special adaptations that enable them to live in salty, oxygen-poor soil. Under the strictest guidelines, there are roughly 54 true species of mangrove belonging to 16 different families. However, because distinguishing a mangrove species is based upon physical and ecological traits rather than family lineage, scientists often differ in what they consider to be a true mangrove. Some species like Conocarpus erectus, the buttonwood, are often grouped with mangroves since they hug the upper edge of mangrove forests, however, they lack many of the characteristic adaptations of mangroves and are labeled âmangrove associates.â When all plants that live in a mangrove environment are accounted for, there are well over 80 mangrove species. Mangrove can also be used as a term that refers to an entire community. The tree and shrub foliage create a rich habitat for other plants and animals to call home, and the branching root system underwater creates a safe haven for many fish, especially easily preyed upon young. Scientists will refer to this as the mangal, but mangrove or mangrove forest works just the same. Mangroves grow in sheltered tropical and subtropical coastal areas across the globe. In general, this is an area between latitudes of 25 degrees north and 25 degrees south, however, geographical limits are highly variable depending upon the area of the world and local climates. In Eastern Australia, the mangrove Avicennia marina can grow as far south as 38 degrees and Avicennia germinans can grow as far north as 32 degrees in the Atlantic. A major restriction for where mangroves can live is temperature. The cooler temperatures of northern temperate regions prove too much for the mangroves. A fluctuation of ten degrees in a short period of time is enough stress to damage the plant and freezing temperatures for even a few hours can kill some mangrove species. However, rising temperatures and sea level due to climate change are allowing mangroves to expand their ranges farther away from the equator and encroach on temperate wetlands, like salt marshes. Also, on some isolated tropical islands, such as Hawaii and Tahiti, mangroves are not native and are sometimes considered invasive species. The salty soils of the intertidal pose an inhospitable barrier for most woody plants, but the mangrove is uniquely adapted for these conditions. These adaptations are so successful that some mangroves are able to grow in soils that reach salinities up to 75 parts per thousand (ppt), about two times the salinity of ocean water. However, most mangroves do better in ranges between 3 and 27 ppt. To differentiate species that use different methods for dealing with salt, scientists categorize mangroves as either secretorsâthose that actively rid their tissue of saltâand non-secretorsâthose that block the salt from entering their tissue. In species from the genera Rhizophora (the red mangrove) and Bruguiera, the plants create a barrier and can almost completely exclude the salt from entering their vascular systemâover 90 percent of the salt from seawater is excluded. This barrier acts against osmosis, a process where water moves from areas low in salt concentration to areas high in salt concentration. If the mangrove didnât have such a barrier, the salty ocean water would suck the mangrove dry. For many mangroves, however, the salt is dealt with after it enters the plant. Mangroves categorized as secretors, including species in the black mangrove genus Avicennia, push salt from the ocean water out through special pores or salt glands within their leaves. As the salty water evaporates, noticeable salt crystals often form on the surface of the leaves. The leaves of some mangrove can also store unwanted salt. Since leaf cells can hold a large volume of water when compared to all other cells, salt is drawn to the leaves as a mechanism to balance the salt concentration. As the leaves age, the cells grow in size since more water is needed to dilute the accumulating salt. This hoarding of water creates thick and fleshy leaves, a characteristic called succulence. Eventually, the leaves age and fall off the tree, taking the salt with them. The soil where mangroves are rooted poses a second challenge for plants as it is severely lacking in oxygen. Even though plants use photosynthesis to produce energy, they must then use that fuel through cellular respiration to power their cells and, like animals, consume oxygen. Most plants can easily take oxygen from gases trapped within the surrounding soil, but for mangrove roots this is not an option and they need an access to air. Not only are mangrove roots underground, they are also flooded with water up to two times a day. This unique environment allowed for the evolution of a variety of special structures that help the underground roots gain access to air, even when submerged by the ... [Content truncated]",

Pythons have severely impacted native species and ecosystems in Florida and represent one of the most intractable invasive-species management issues across the globe. The difficulty stems from a unique combination of inaccessible habitat and the cryptic and resilient nature of pythons that thrive in the subtropical environment of southern Florida, rendering them extremely challenging to detect. Here we provide a comprehensive review and synthesis of the science relevant to managing invasive Burmese pythons. We describe existing control tools and review challenges to productive research, identifying key knowledge gaps that would improve future research and decision making for python control.",

Pythons have severely impacted native species and ecosystems in Florida and represent one of the most intractable invasive-species management issues across the globe. The difficulty stems from a unique combination of inaccessible habitat and the cryptic and resilient nature of pythons that thrive in the subtropical environment of southern Florida, rendering them extremely challenging to detect. Here we provide a comprehensive review and synthesis of the science relevant to managing invasive Burmese pythons. We describe existing control tools and review challenges to productive research, identifying key knowledge gaps that would improve future research and decision making for python control.",
