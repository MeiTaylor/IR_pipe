2024-07-15 16:45:31,742 - MainThread - INFO - Based on the information provided, the claim about a video showing a shark swimming on a flooded highway during Hurricane Ian in Florida cannot be determined as true or false. There is no specific analysis or debunking of this claim in the given information, so we lack evidence to make a conclusive determination.

Regarding the second example provided about the beach party in Kyiv, the analysis yielded a reliability probability of 99% and determined the claim to be false based on the QA_CONTEXTS provided. However, this does not apply to the claim about the shark in Florida.

Therefore, the answer to whether the truthfulness of the claim can be determined based on the existing information is "No."
