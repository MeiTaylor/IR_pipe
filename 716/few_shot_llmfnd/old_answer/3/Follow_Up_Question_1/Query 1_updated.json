But it's tough.\n\n          Presenter\n              @jonathansamuels\n\nTuesday 4 October 2022 07:53, UK\nAs we drove towards Fort Myers, what struck us first was the traffic.\nWe were one of thousands of cars trying to get into the worst hit area of Hurricane Ian.\nThe queues started the other side of the state. A line of cars, stuffed with bedding, some with strapped on generators, some pulling rowing boats, all headed back in, to see what was left.\nAs we got closer, the desperation grew greater.\nIn Fort Myers, zigzags of cars wound down palm tree-strewn streets, in line for a gas station with no gas. People were stood waiting with jerrycans, some since the early hours of the morning.\nThere is destruction here: upended concrete pillars, boats piled up on the shore, but the Stars and Stripes still fly - albeit the flags are ripped in half.\nIt is the logistical challenge that is most striking. Basic operations have been smashed to a halt.\n\n                  Shark attacks teenager during lifeguard training camp in Florida\n                \n\n                  Rapper Foolio shot and killed while celebrating 26th birthday in Tampa, Florida\n                \n\n                  Family sues NASA after Florida home is hit by debris from space station\n                \nA two-hour drive up the coast took us six hours last night, through flooded back roads, passing abandoned cars and emergency vehicles evacuating patients from hospitals with no power.\nDrivers were disregarding road markings - even roads themselves - in the frantic overnight scramble to reroute out of a highway that was flooding with run-off.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\nThe storm surges have moved north, but it's not over for the residents of southwest Florida. Rivers are swelling. Areas in desperate need are being cut off in new ways, as the water rises.\nNow communities are taking rescue efforts into their own hands. We saw one elderly man and his dog saved from waist-high flooding in his home. The rescuers? His neighbours, who had brought a boat to find out how badly their own home was hit. The family heard him banging on his door and shouting for help.\nState trooper escorts clear the path for tankers of water, headed to hospitals and emergency water distribution centres. While 1.5 million homes and businesses are still without power.\nThere is talk of billions of dollars in damage, of years of rebuilding homes and harbours. But for now, the focus of those here is on getting back the bare necessities.",

                    "content": "Hurricane Ian destroyed several portions of the Sanibel Causeway, the series of bridges that connects mainland Florida to Sanibel Island \u2014 which is home to some 6,500 people and located just south of where the storm made landfall.\r\n\nOfficials have characterized the extent of the damage as beyond simple repairs.\r\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis confirmed at a Thursday morning briefing that the Sanibel Causeway is one of at least two bridges (along with the bridge that connects to Pine Island) that are \"impassable\" and will \"require structural rebuilds.\"\r\n\nHe said on Friday that the three-mile causeway \"had breaks in multiple parts of it.\"\r\n\n\"It was not where the water and the pylons were, those held up very well,\" he said at a Friday morning briefing. \"It was where you had some on the sandbar, and that got washed out from underneath.\"\r\n\nLee County had ordered people on the island to evacuate before the storm hit, though not everyone did. Sanibel Mayor Holly Smith said Thursday that the occupants of about 200 homes had stayed behind, and that authorities had already confirmed two injuries and 12 deaths on Sanibel.\r\n\nIt appears that other residents are effectively stranded on the island, either because they declined evacuation offers by rescue crews or because they are unaccounted for.\r\n\nDeSantis said that same day that an unspecified number of people had been safely brought off the island and that rescue efforts by the U.S. Coast Guard, local law enforcement and state teams were ongoing. The Coast Guard has shared photos of crews airlifting people from flooded parts of the island.\r\n\nOfficials are running barges in order to ferry supplies and heavier equipment to the island (whereas emergency responders had initially been traveling lighter and via air), DeSantis said on Friday.\r\n\nSmith had requested barge service for short-term recovery, as well as \"possibly for the long-term for island access due to the condition of the causeway.\"\r\n\nSmith is urging residents to provide authorities with the names and addresses of any loved ones who may have remained on the island, saying \"our first priority is to get those who are stranded to safety\" and account for missing people.\r\n\nNo electric customers on Sanibel Island had power as of an 11 a.m. ET Friday morning update from the Lee County Electric Cooperative.\r\n\n\n\nAt least three sections of the causeway were washed away by the storm surge, CNN affiliates WBBH and WPLG report, cutting the Sanibel and Captiva islands off from the rest of the state.\r\n\nDamage to the causeway was first reported in the early hours of Thursday morning by local journalists, who shared photos of the bridge with pieces missing.\r\n\nAmong them were Tampa Bay Times reporter Zachary Sampson and photojournalist Douglas Clifford, who ventured out of their Fort Myers hotel room in the early hours of Thursday morning to check on the damage and publish eyewitness accounts on the Times' website.\r\n\nIn a dispatch at 2 a.m. ET, they reported that the half-mile of road leading to the Sanibel Causeway was impassable.\r\n\n\"The pavement is folded up like an accordion, ripped to ribbons by a powerful storm surge,\" they wrote. \"Nearby, a spiral staircase was deposited in the brush next to a white pickup. The storm flung a boat trailer and other debris, too.\"\r\n\nThey describe seeing sheets of sand strewn across the pavement and watching around 1:30 a.m. as two cars tried unsuccessfully to access the island. One was full of young men who were trying to reach a friend, they added.\r\n\nAt 4:15 a.m., the journalists confirmed that a section of the causeway had been wiped out by the storm:\r\n\n\"An alarm bleats endlessly at the tollbooth for the Sanibel Causeway. Step just beyond it, and the road soon gives way. Where the bridge rises from the mainland toward the island, one of the first sections of the span has disappeared. Crumbled pavement lies near the water's edge. The rest of the bridge stretches forward, unreachable.\" \r\n\n Copyright 2022 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. \n\n",

                    "content": "Hurricane Ian pummeled Florida\u2019s Southwestern coast Wednesday afternoon before moving toward Orlando in the evening, leaving more than 2.5 million people across Florida without power Thursday and widespread flooding in the areas that were in the category 4 storm\u2019s destructive path. Search and rescues are still underway as dozens of homes remain underwater in Fort Myers, near where the storm, with 150 mph winds, made landfall in Cayo Costa Wednesday. On Thursday, President Biden said Ian could be the \u201cdeadliest hurricane in Florida\u2019s history,\u201d during a FEMA briefing. While the death toll from the storm is unclear, Biden said there could be a \u201csubstantial loss of life.\u201d Although the storm was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm Thursday morning, experts say Ian, which currently has sustained winds of 65 mph and was located 25 miles from north north-east of Cape Canaveral at 11 a.m., could regain strength as it travels across Florida and up the Atlantic coast\u2014threatening Georgia and South Carolina. \u201cSome slight re-intensification is forecast, and Ian could be near hurricane strength when it approaches the coast of South Carolina on Friday,\u201d the National Hurricane Center said Thursday. Ian brought torrential rain, storm surges up to 18 feet, flooding that swept away cars, toppled infrastructure, trapped people in their homes and devastated communities across Florida. Officials says it could be days before they\u2019re able to asses the scale of the damage Ian caused. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a storm that\u2019s changed the character of a significant part of our state,\u201d Fla. Gov. Ron DeSantis said on Thursday morning from an Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee. \u201cThis is going to require, not just the emergency response now, and the days or weeks ahead, I mean this is going to require years of effort, to be able to rebuild, to come back.\u201d Read More: Yes, Climate Change Is Making Storms Like Hurricane Ian Worse Desantis added that there were two unconfirmed fatalities in Florida from the storm so far. Emergency officials urge people to seek higher ground and shelter in place until the threat clears completely. President Biden declared a disaster in Florida Thursday morning, a move that makes millions in emergency recovery aid available, particularly for the counties affected the most, and DeSantis said the state will push for more federal help. In addition to the \u201cthousands of Floridians who need help rebuilding\u201d their homes and businesses, DeSantis said, the storm destroyed hospitals, power lines, roads and bridges that connected islands to the mainland. . Here\u2019s what you need to know. Although much of the state lost power and underwent evacuation orders, Southwest Florida, the region where the hurricane made landfall, has been the hardest hit. Coastal storm surges were highest in this area and subsequent flooding and heavy rainfall made the situation worse. On Thursday morning, Ian was still dumping large amounts of rain in the area, and flooding is still a large concern. On Thursday, emergency responders attempted to work through a backlog of 911 calls in areas where the storm had been impassable like in Cape Coral and Fort Myers where emergency responders had to prioritize \u201curgent, life threatening situations\u201d first. The Florida Department of Transportation was deployed to clear roads of debris to help disaster responders get around, but DeSantis has asked everyone else to stay off the roads for their own safety. Gov. DeSantis added during Thursday\u2019s press conference that Ian \u201cis not done creating damage,\u201d and told residents that it\u2019s still a hazardous situation. Search and rescue efforts are underway in hard hit Lee County where the Sanibel Causeway and Matlacha islands suffered extensive damage. Power is out for 98% of the county as well as much of the water system and parts of the county are under a boil water notice. Lee\u2019s more than 400 traffic signals are also not fully operational and drainage infrastructure in low-lying areas has failed leaving many roads flooded. Nearby Charlotte County is home to Punta Cana where the water system is currently empty and damaged pipes may take days to repair. The City of Naples in Collier County has asked people not to drive in or to Naples and is under a local state of emergency. DeSoto County, Hendry County and Glades County also all opened temporary shelters. Power outages and spotty cellular service hit Southwest Florida and in some places, services like sanitation, trash collection and postal service are non functioning for the foreseeable future. More airports have halted operations, including Jacksonville International. Most municipalities in Southwest Florida are asking residents to shelter in place while emergency and public service groups rush to repair essential infrastructure. Floridians had been preparing for Ian since Monday, especially around the Tampa Bay region where flights were pre-emptively canceled, power was cut in downtown Tampa by the city to mitigate equipment damage from the storm and more than 2.5 million people were given evacuation orders. The death toll related to Ian is unclear, but Alongside Biden saying there could be a \u201csubstantial loss of life,\u201d Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceno told Good Morning America on Thursday that he didn\u2019t have a confirmed number of fatalities from the storm, but that he definitely knows \u201cthe fatalities are in the hundreds.\u201d Gov. DeSantis later clarified during a press conference Thursday that Marceno\u2019s statement was an estimate based on the emergency calls that law enforcement received. The governor said that they have not confirmed \u201chundreds of fatalities.\u201d Marceno also said Lee County had received thousands of 911 calls over the course of the storm, but that emergency responders \u201cstill cannot access many of the people that are in need.\u201d Similar statements from law enforcement agencies in nearby areas also confirmed that first responders are having a great deal of difficulty accessing flooded neighborhoods and collapsed buildings. The U.S. Department of Labor put out a statement on Thursday reminding those involved in Hurricane Ian recovery efforts to stay vigilant of hazards that flooding, power loss and storm debris can cause. Such hazards have ... [Content truncated]",

                    "content": "FOLLOW ON Advertisement The Associated Press Staff Contact CHARLESTON, S.C. -- A revived Hurricane Ian pounded coastal South Carolina on Friday, ripping apart piers and flooding streets after the ferocious storm caused catastrophic damage in Florida, trapping thousands in their homes and leaving at least 27 people dead. The powerful storm, estimated to be one of the costliest hurricanes ever to hit the U.S., has terrorized people for much of the week -- pummeling western Cuba and raking across Florida before gathering strength in the warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean to curve back and strike South Carolina. While Ian's center came ashore near Georgetown, South Carolina, on Friday with much weaker winds than when it crossed Florida's Gulf Coast earlier in the week, the storm left many areas of Charleston's downtown peninsula under water. It also washed away parts of four piers along the coast, including two at Myrtle Beach. Online cameras showed seawater filling neighbourhoods in Garden City to calf level. As Ian moved across South Carolina on its way to North Carolina Friday evening, it dropped from a hurricane to a post-tropical cyclone. Ian left a broad swath of destruction in Florida, flooding areas on both of its coasts, tearing homes from their slabs, demolishing beachfront businesses and leaving more than 2 million people without power. Many of the deaths were drownings, including that of a 68-year-old woman swept away into the ocean by a wave. A 67-year-old man who was waiting to be rescued died after falling into rising water inside his home, authorities said. Other storm-related fatalities included a 22-year-old woman who died after an ATV rollover from a road washout and a 71-year-old man who fell off a roof while putting up rain shutters. An 80-year-old woman and a 94-year-old man who relied on oxygen machines also died after the equipment stopped working during power outages. Another three people died in Cuba earlier in the week as the storm churned northward. The death toll was expected to increase substantially once emergency officials have an opportunity to search many of the hardest-hit areas. Rescue crews piloted boats and waded through riverine streets in Florida after the storm to save thousands of people trapped amid flooded homes and shattered buildings . Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Friday that crews had gone door-to-door to over 3,000 homes in the hardest-hit areas. \"There's really been a Herculean effort,\" he said during a news conference in Tallahassee. Hurricane Ian has likely caused \"well over $100 billion\" in damage, including $63 billion in privately insured losses, according to the disaster modeling firm Karen Clark & Company, which regularly issues flash catastrophe estimates. If those numbers are borne out, that would make Ian at least the fourth costliest hurricane in U.S. history. Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said first responders have focused so far on \"hasty\" searches, aimed at emergency rescues and initial assessments, which will be followed by two additional waves of searches. Initial responders who come across possible remains are leaving them without confirming, he said Friday, describing as an example the case of a submerged home. \"The water was up over the rooftop, right, but we had a Coast Guard rescue swimmer swim down into it and he could identify that it appeared to be human remains. We do not know exactly how many,\" Guthrie said. Desperate to locate and rescue their loved ones, social media users shared phone numbers, addresses and photos of their family members and friends online for anyone who can check on them. Orlando residents returned to flooded homes Friday, rolling up their pants to wade through muddy, knee-high water in their streets. Friends of Ramon Rodriguez dropped off ice, bottled water and hot coffee at the entrance to his subdivision, where 10 of the 50 homes were flooded and the road looked like a lake. He had no power or food at his house, and his car was trapped by the water. \"There's water everywhere,\" Rodriguez said. \"The situation here is pretty bad.\" The devastating storm surge destroyed many older homes on the barrier island of Sanibel, Florida, and gouged crevices into its sand dunes. Taller condominium buildings were intact but with the bottom floor blown out. Trees and utility poles were strewn everywhere. Municipal rescuers, private teams and the Coast Guard used boats and helicopters Friday to evacuate residents who stayed for the storm and then were cut off from the mainland when a causeway collapsed. Volunteers who went to the island on personal watercraft helped escort an elderly couple to an area where Coast Guard rescuers took them aboard a helicopter. Hours after weakening to a tropical storm while crossing the Florida peninsula, Ian regained strength Thursday evening over the Atlantic. Ian made landfall in South Carolina with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). When it hit Florida's Gulf Coast on Wednesday, it was a powerful Category 4 hurricane with 150 mph (240 km/h). After the heaviest of the rainfall blew through Charleston, Will Shalosky examined a large elm tree in front of his house that had fallen across his downtown street. He noted the damage could have been much worse. \"If this tree has fallen a different way, it would be in our house,\" Shalosky said. \"It's pretty scary, pretty jarring.\" Ian's heavy rains and winds crossed into North Carolina on Friday evening. Gov. Roy Cooper warned residents to be vigilant, given that up to 8 inches (20.3 centimetres) of rain could fall in some areas. \"Hurricane Ian is at our door. Expect drenching rain and sustained heavy winds over most of our state,\" Cooper said. \"Our message today is simple: Be smart and be safe.\" In Washington, President Joe Biden said he was directing \"every possible action be taken to save lives and get help to survivors.\" \"It's going to take months, years to rebuild,\" Biden said. \"I just want the people of Florida to know, we see what you're going through and we're ...
