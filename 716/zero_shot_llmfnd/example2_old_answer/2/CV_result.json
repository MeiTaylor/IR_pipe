        "Question": "Can the geographical location and weather conditions depicted in the video be verified to confirm the presence of a shark on a flooded highway during Hurricane Ian in Florida?",
        "Answer": "Therefore, the presence of a shark on a flooded highway during Hurricane Ian in Florida can be verified based on the authentic video of a fish resembling a shark in a flooded backyard in Fort Myers. However, due to the conflicting opinions of experts and the history of hoax shark videos during hurricanes, the absolute confirmation of the fish being a shark is uncertain.",

        "Answer": "Based on the evidence provided, expert analysis has been conducted to verify the species of the fish seen in the flooded highway video during Hurricane Ian in Florida. The video showing the fish has been authenticated by various sources [Query 2_evidence_1], [Query 2_evidence_2], and [Query 2_evidence_3]. \n\nGeorge Burgess, a former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History's shark program, stated that the fish in the video appeared to be a juvenile shark [Query 2_evidence_2]. Additionally, Dominic Cameratta, the person who filmed the video, estimated the fish to be about four feet long and believed it was a shark [Query 2_evidence_2].\n\nHowever, Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami's shark conservation program, mentioned that it was difficult to definitively identify the species of the fish seen in the video [Query 2_evidence_2].\n\nThe information regarding the various expert opinions and the analysis of the fish in the flooded highway video provides a solid basis for the verification of the species involved. The overall confidence level in the expert analysis conducted to verify the species of the fish in the flooded highway video during Hurricane Ian in Florida is evaluated at 80%.",

        "Answer": "To definitively confirm the presence of a shark in the flooded highway video during Hurricane Ian in Florida, several pieces of evidence and expert analysis can be referenced:\n\n1. Expert Analysis: George Burgess, the former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History's shark program, mentioned that the fish in the video appeared to be a juvenile shark [Query 2_evidence_2]. Dominic Cameratta, the individual who filmed the video, estimated the fish to be about four feet long and believed it was a shark [Query 2_evidence_2]. However, Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami's shark conservation program, stated that definitively identifying the species of the fish was challenging [Query 2_evidence_2].\n\n2. Video Authenticity: The video showing the fish resembling a shark in a flooded backyard in Fort Myers during Hurricane Ian has been authenticated by various sources [Query 2_evidence_1].\n\nBased on the expert opinions and the analysis of the fish in the flooded highway video, the presence of a shark can be verified with a confidence level of 80%. Despite some uncertainty due to conflicting expert opinions, the evidence points towards a stronger likelihood of the fish being a juvenile shark.",
