Red snapper results will be incorporated in stock assessment simulations to estimate the increase in assessment efficiency, as well as effects on estimates of scientific uncertainty. Assessment simulations for vermilion snapper and gray triggerfish results will be accomplished with the second year of CRP funding to be applied for in FY19.

Specific Priorities in Solicitation to Which Project Responds: 1.n. Research is needed to assess the selectivity of hook and line gear for Red Snapper. 1.e.

But a mobile phone video filmed during Hurricane Ian\u2019s assault on south-west Florida isn\u2019t just another fishy story.\nThe video, which showed a large, dark fish with distinct dorsal fins thrashing around an inundated Fort Myers back yard, racked up more than 12m views on Twitter within a day, as users responded with disbelief and comparisons to the \u201cSharknado\u201d film series.\nDominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer, confirmed he filmed the clip from his patio on Wednesday morning when he saw something \u201cflopping around\u201d in his neighbour\u2019s flooded yard.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what it was, it just looked like a fish or something,\u201d he said. \u201cI zoomed in, and all my friends are like: \u2018It\u2019s like a shark, man!\u2019\u201d\nHe guessed the fish was about 1.2 metres (4ft) long.\nExperts were divided over whether the clip showed a shark or another large fish. George Burgess, the former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History\u2019s shark programme, said in an email that it \u201cappears to be a juvenile shark\u201d, while Dr Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami\u2019s shark conservation programme, wrote that \u201cit\u2019s pretty hard to tell\u201d.\nNevertheless, some Twitter users dubbed the hapless fish the \u201cstreet shark\u201d.\nCameratta said the flooding had only just begun when the video was taken, but that the waters were \u201call the way up to our house\u201d by the time the Associated Press reached him by phone on Wednesday evening.\nHe said the fish may have made its way up from nearby Hendry Creek into a retention pond, which then overflowed, spilling the creature into his neighbour\u2019s back yard. A visual analysis of nearby property confirmed it matches the physical landmarks in the video.\nLeslie Guelcher, a professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, was among the online sleuths who initially thought the video was fake.\n\u201cDon\u2019t think this is real. According to the index on the video it was created in June 2010. Someone else posted it at 10am as in Fort Myers, but the storm surge wasn\u2019t like that at 10am,\u201d she tweeted on Wednesday.\nGuelcher acknowledged later, though, that online tools she and others were using to establish the video\u2019s origins didn\u2019t actually show when the video itself was created, merely when the social media profile of the user was created.\nThe AP confirmed through the original clip\u2019s metadata that it was captured on Wednesday morning.\n\u201cIt makes a bit more sense from a flooding standpoint,\u201d Guelcher said by email, when informed the fish was spotted near an overflowing pond. \u201cBut how on earth would a shark go from the Gulf of Mexico to a retention pond?\u201d\nYannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, said most sharks leave shallow bays ahead of hurricanes, possibly tipped off to their arrival by a change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he said, or been washed into it.\n\u201cYoung bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters \u2013 rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments \u2013 and often appear in similar videos in Florida water bodies connected to the sea, such as coastal canals and ponds,\u201d Burgess said. \u201cAssuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.\u201d\nCameratta sent the video to a group chat on WhatsApp on Wednesday morning, according to his friend John Paul Murray, who sent the AP a timestamped screenshot.",

Oceans all over the world are experiencing warmer-than-normal temperatures, but waters off the southern U.S. could be on the brink of an ocean heat wave emergency as temperatures rise to unprecedented levels. More than 40% of all global ocean temperatures are currently experiencing a heat wave, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The heat is even more acute off the coast of Florida, where ocean temperatures are currently \"strikingly warm,\" Brian McNaldy, senior research associate at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science, told ABC News. On Thursday, Miami reached a heat index in the triple digits for the 39th consecutive day, extending a record the city had broken the week before, according to the National Weather Service. \"When you're breaking records by such large margins, that's what makes it alarming,\" McNaldy said. \"We're not even close to what the previous record was, let alone the average.\" The waters surrounding the Sunshine State have been no different. This week, while land temperatures have been about 95 degrees in South Florida, ocean temperatures clocked in at about 94 degrees -- up to 7 degrees warmer than they should be this time of year. Water temperatures do not typically measure this high until late August or early September, experts said. The relentless heat on both land and ocean are expected to persist through the rest of July and August -- traditionally the hottest time of the year -- forecasts show. Days with water temperature above 90 degrees Fahrenheit have increased by 2500% in the Florida Keys since 1975, according to Ian Enochs, NOAA research ecologist and head of the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory's Coral Program. Relative to temperatures recorded from 1991 to 2020, the waters surrounding South Florida are 5 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit above normal, McNaldy said. One of the reasons why ocean temperatures in the Atlantic are so hot is because the Bermuda high is stuck in an abnormal position. Typically, the high sits further north and is stronger, but this year it has remained further south and is weaker, pushing those cooling trade winds south of Florida. Without those cooling winds, there is far less evaporation off the top of the water, which would bring the temperatures down. While reliable records only go back between 40 and 80 years for water temperatures on buoys and observation docks in the Keys, inferred heat data indicates this is the hottest ocean waters have gotten since humans have been on Earth, McNaldy said. The warming can have \"significant impacts on marine life as well as coastal communities and economies,\" according to NOAA, which has issued a level 2 alert for the reefs, the highest level, indicating bleaching of the coral reefs surrounding South Florida is likely to occur. \"Florida's coral reefs don't respond well to this,\" Abigail Clark, an assistant professor of marine science and technology at The College of the Florida Keys, told ABC News. The effects of a mass coral die-off could be devastating, as 25% of all marine life, including dolphins, turtles and sharks, depend on the reef for survival. The reef also brings in billions in revenue to the state through the tourism and commercial fishing industries. This bleaching event is different than anything the Florida Keys has ever seen, said Keri O'Neil, director and senior scientist of the Coral Conservation Program at The Florida Aquarium in Tampa. While some of the coral in the region has survived 3,000 years of change, several coral ecosystems have succumbed to the heat in the past 10 days, O'Neil said. The last four decades have not been kind to the Florida Reef Tract, North America's only barrier reef that stretches about 360 miles from Dry Tortugas National Park west of the Florida Keys to the St. Lucie Inlet in Martin County, O'Neil said. The barrier reef has lost about 90% of its live coral cover since the 1980s, O'Neil said. The Florida Aquarium and its partners restore Florida's coral reef with a \"concrete seawall\" that aims to absorb storm surge and wave action. Researchers at the Florida Aquarium have also created an ocean greenhouse near Tampa where they genetically select and breed coral for strength and heat resilience. The \"babies\" that were planted four years ago have thrived despite transient periods of warmth because there have also been periods of relief. Relief likely won't come this year, as the next six weeks are forecast to be just as hot. The bleaching events have already started, and alert levels for corals are at their highest mark, across the Caribbean. \"Our staff might come up high-fiving or they might come up in tears,\" O'Neil said of the monitoring. The ocean warming is widespread. Elsewhere in the world, marine heat waves are currently occurring in the equatorial Pacific; the Northeast Pacific; the Northwest Pacific in the Kuroshio extension region and the Sea of Japan; the tropical North Atlantic; the Northeast Atlantic along the Iberian coast as far northward as Ireland and the U.K.; the Southwest Pacific just southeast of New Zealand; and the Western Indian Ocean southeast of Madagascar, according to NOAA. The average sea surface temperature for June across the north Atlantic was 0.91 degrees Celsius above average, according to Copernicus, the the European Union's climate change service. This is around 0.5 degrees Celsius more than the previous warmest June, recorded in 2010. The warming atmosphere may also be contributing to ocean warming in the region. January through June ranked as the warmest on record for air temperature in Florida, which could be causing increases in ocean temperatures as well, experts say. The current ocean temperatures in the North Atlantic are typical of late summer, rather than early to mid-summer, experts say. The warming could also affect the intensity of hurricanes to come later in the season. Because of the warm temperatures on land and sea, hurricane forecasters at Colorado State University have ...

                    "content": "California State University Long Beach Shark Lab director Dr. Chris Lowe joined FOX Weather on Wednesday to discuss a new study that shows great white sharks are swimming closer to swimmers without them realizing what is lurking beneath the surface of the water.\nLONG BEACH, Calif. \u2013 Groundbreaking research released last week shows how often sharks have been spotted swimming near beachgoers in California who have no idea what\u2019s lurking in the water beneath them \u2013 and it\u2019s way more often than you\u2019d think.\nAerial surveys were conducted by California State University Long Beach (CSULB) graduate student Patrick Rex every month over a period of 2 years along several Southern California beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego between January 2019 through March 2021.\nGROUNDBREAKING RESEARCH SHOWS GREAT WHITE SHARKS MAY CHANGE COLOR TO BETTER HUNT THEIR PREY\nJuvenile white sharks (JWS) utilize the populated Southern California beaches as a nursery habitat and have a high co-occurrence with people.\nAnd the research findings showed that sharks and people were found swimming together in the water 97% of the time \u2013 and most swimmers had no idea, according to the study.\n\"Most (people) can\u2019t see the sharks when they are at water level, but the drone picks them out quite well,\" said Dr. Chris Lowe, an author of the study and the director of the Shark Lab at CSULB.\nNEW SHARK-SAVING TECHNOLOGY AIMS TO PROTECT SPECIES' MOST VULNERABLE HABITATS\nFOX Weather multimedia journalist Brandy Campbell was at Aquarium Encounters and spoke with Marine Biologist Kee Bligh about ways to avoid being bitten by a shark.\nWhat's even more interesting is that during that staggering 97% statistic of nearby sharks to swimmers, the number of unprovoked shark bites in that region is \"extremely low.\"\nSo low, that over the two-year survey period, only one minor potential unprovoked shark bite was reported across Southern California at one of the aggregation sites.\nAccording to the study, the incident was reported in the spring of 2020 when a female swimmer said a marine animal bit her and saw a JWS leaving the area. However, the injury couldn\u2019t be confidently identified as being caused by a JWS.\nFLORIDA SHARK MATERNITY WARD MAY HAVE BEEN FOREVER CHANGED AFTER DIRECT HIT BY HURRICANE IAN\nSurfing expert Joe Appert joined FOX Weather to discuss whether shark-repellent wetsuits can prevent attacks.\nLowe said he hopes this new study will change how people think about sharks and has already noticed people have started to do so.\n\"We\u2019ve already noted changes in attitudes by many local surfers who know the sharks are there and watch for them,\" he said. \"Some have even become quite protective of the sharks.\"\nLowe added that the main concern is that people will try to see or film the sharks, which could lead to injuries.\nSTAY SHARK SMART: WHAT TO KNOW WHEN YOU HEAD INTO THE WATER\n\"Chasing them around could change their behavior and make them more defensive,\" he said. Lowe continued that this new information shows sharks aren\u2019t out to attack humans.\n\"This study really dispels that myth that if a white shark I nearby, it will bite you,\" he said. \"We found that at these shark nurseries, sharks and people are sharing waves every single day without incident.\"\nNEARLY TWO-THIRDS OF CORAL REEF SHARKS THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION FROM OVERFISHING AS MAIN CAUSE, STUDY FINDS\nA tiger shark rammed and bit a fisherman\u2019s kayak off Hawaii\u2019s Oahu island on Friday, May 12.\u00a0Video recorded by Scott Haraguchi shows the animal charge at him and bite his kayak. Haraguchi then kicks the shark away.\nLowe added that maybe the recovery of the white shark population near the area is a good thing and a sign that the coastal waters are getting healthier for sharks to thrive. \"Our study shows that if we leave them alone, they leave us alone.\"\nAnd this study is also being used to keep people safe when enjoying the water. California lifeguard agencies can hopefully adopt the findings to monitor beaches for shark activity.\nThe study says the New South Wales territory in Australia developed a Shark Smart program that similarly surveys local beaches to identify shark hotspots at local beaches.\n\n        This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or\n        redistributed. \u00a92024 FOX News Network, LLC.

Blame geography for the U.S. getting hit by stronger, costlier, more varied and frequent extreme weather than anywhere on the planet, several experts said. Two oceans, the Gulf of Mexico, the Rocky Mountains, jutting peninsulas like Florida, clashing storm fronts and the jet stream combine to naturally brew the nastiest of weather. That\u2019s only part of it. Nature dealt the United States a bad hand, but people have made it much worse by what, where and how we build, several experts told The Associated Press. Then add climate change, and \u201cbuckle up. More extreme events are expected,\u201d said Rick Spinrad, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Tornadoes. Hurricanes. Flash floods. Droughts. Wildfires. Blizzards. Ice storms. Nor\u2019easters. Lake-effect snow. Heat waves. Severe thunderstorms. Hail. Lightning. Atmospheric rivers. Derechos. Dust storms. Monsoons. Bomb cyclones. And the dreaded polar vortex. It starts with \u201cwhere we are on the globe,\u201d North Carolina state climatologist Kathie Dello said. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a little bit \u2026 unlucky.\u201d China may have more people, and a large land area like the United States, but \u201cthey don\u2019t have the same kind of clash of air masses as much as you do in the U.S. that is producing a lot of the severe weather,\u201d said Susan Cutter, director of the Hazards Vulnerability and Resilience Institute at the University of South Carolina. The U.S. is by far the king of tornadoes and other severe storms. READ MORE: How California is tackling the increasing threat of mudslides \u201cIt really starts with kind of two things. Number one is the Gulf of Mexico. And number two is elevated terrain to the west,\u201d said Victor Gensini, a Northern Illinois University meteorology professor. Look at Friday\u2019s deadly weather, and watch out for the next week to see it in action: Dry air from the West goes up over the Rockies and crashes into warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, and it\u2019s all brought together along a stormy jet stream. In the West, it\u2019s a drumbeat of atmospheric rivers. In the Atlantic, it\u2019s nor\u2019easters in the winter, hurricanes in the summer and sometimes a weird combination of both, like Superstorm Sandy. \u201cIt is a reality that regardless of where you are in the country, where you call home, you\u2019ve likely experienced a high-impact weather event firsthand,\u201d Spinrad said. Killer tornadoes in December 2021 that struck Kentucky illustrated the uniqueness of the United States. They hit areas with large immigrant populations. People who fled Central and South America, Bosnia and Africa were all victims. A huge problem was that tornadoes really didn\u2019t happen in those people\u2019s former homes, so they didn\u2019t know what to watch for or what to do, or even know they had to be concerned about tornadoes, said Joseph Trujillo Falcon, a NOAA social scientist who investigated the aftermath. READ MORE: Explaining the forces that fueled Alabama\u2019s deadly tornado With colder air up in the Arctic and warmer air in the tropics, the area between them \u2014 the mid-latitudes, where the United States is \u2014 gets the most interesting weather because of how the air acts in clashing temperatures, and that north-south temperature gradient drives the jet stream, said Northern Illinois meteorology professor Walker Ashley. Then add mountain ranges that go north-south, jutting into the winds flowing from west to east, and underneath it all the toasty Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf injects hot, moist air underneath the often cooler, dry air lifted by the mountains, \u201cand that doesn\u2019t happen really anywhere else in the world,\u201d Gensini said. If the United States as a whole has it bad, the South has it the worst, said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd, a former president of the American Meteorological Society. \u201cWe drew the short straw (in the South) that we literally can experience every single type of extreme weather event,\u201d Shepherd said. \u201cIncluding blizzards. Including wildfires, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes. Every single type. \u2026 There\u2019s no other place in the United States that can say that.\u201d Florida, North Carolina and Louisiana also stick out in the water so are more prone to being hit by hurricanes, said Shepherd and Dello. The South has more manufactured housing that is vulnerable to all sorts of weather hazards, and storms are more likely to happen there at night, Ashley said. Night storms are deadly because people can\u2019t see them and are less likely to take cover, and they miss warnings in their sleep. The extreme weather triggered by America\u2019s unique geography creates hazards. But it takes humans to turn those hazards into disasters, Ashley and Gensini said. Just look where cities pop up in America and the rest of the world: near water that floods, except maybe Denver, said South Carolina\u2019s Cutter. More people are moving to areas, such as the South, where there are more hazards. READ MORE: After a year of extreme floods and severe drought, what is Missouri doing about climate change? \u201cOne of the ways in which you can make your communities more resilient is to not develop them in the most hazard-prone way or in the most hazard-prone portion of the community,\u201d Cutter said. \u201cThe insistence on building up barrier islands and development on barrier islands, particularly on the East Coast and the Gulf Coast, knowing that that sand is going to move and having hurricanes hit with some frequency \u2026 seems like a colossal waste of money.\u201d Construction standards tend to be at the bare minimum and less likely to survive the storms, Ashley said. \u201cOur infrastructure is crumbling and nowhere near being climate-resilient at all,\u201d Shepherd said. Poverty makes it hard to prepare for and bounce back from disasters, especially in the South, Shepherd said. That vulnerability is an even bigger issue in other places in the world. \u201cSafety can be bought,\u201d Ashley said. \u201cThose that are well-to-do and who have resources can buy safety and will ...
