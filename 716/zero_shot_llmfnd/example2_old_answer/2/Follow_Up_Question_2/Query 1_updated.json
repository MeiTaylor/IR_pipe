So when a video purporting to show a shark in an inundated backyard in Fort Myers, Fla., surfaced during Hurricane Ian this week, gathering millions of views on Twitter, viewers were skeptical.\nBut this time, the recording was real \u2014 even if there is no confirmation yet that what it depicted was a shark, according to Storyful, which first authenticated the video, and the Associated Press. The news agencies interviewed Dominic Cameratta, a real estate agent who filmed it with his cellphone, and reviewed the clip\u2019s metadata to confirm it was recorded this week.\nThe video shows a fish that looks to be 4 feet long, with sharp dorsal fins, flipping and flopping in the water. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what it was,\u201d Cameratta said. \u201cI zoomed in, and all my friends were like, \u2018It\u2019s like a shark, man!\u2019\u201d\nExperts interviewed by the AP voiced mixed opinions on whether it was indeed a shark. George Burgess, a former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History\u2019s shark program, said the fish appears to be a juvenile shark. But Neil Hammerschlag, the director of the University of Miami\u2019s shark conservation program, said it was difficult to tell what it was.\nWhat\u2019s been happening with animals in Florida during Hurricane Ian?\nImages purportedly showing sharks in urban areas after hurricanes and major floods have been repeatedly debunked since at least 2011, according to Snopes, a fact-checking website.\nOne image of a shark swimming along a flooded highway was uploaded after Hurricane Irene hit Puerto Rico in August 2011. The same image has been widely recirculated after subsequent storms in different areas: In 2016, it was in Daytona Beach, Fla.; a year later, in Houston; and in 2018, it was in Wrightsville Beach, N.C.\nSnopes reported that the original image from 2011 also was a hoax. It incorporated a 2005 photograph of a kayaker being trailed by a great white shark.\nHurricane Ian has devastated Florida, killing at least 23 people, according to state officials. It made its second landfall in the United States on Friday, hitting coastal South Carolina as a Category 1 storm with lashing rains and strong winds.",

In December 2021, the most destructive winter tornado outbreak, known as the Quad-State Tornado Outbreak, caused 89 fatalities, 672 injuries, and at least $3.9 billion in property damages. Scientists at the University of Miami\u2019s Cooperative Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) and NOAA\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) investigated this outbreak and found that it occurred under an exceptionally strong and prolonged negative Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern, which created favorable conditions for tornado outbreaks. July 2, 2024 Tropical Cyclone Freddy breaks records as the longest-lasting cyclone on record. Spanning 36 days, it traveled from the Australia to Africa, nearly 33% of the Earth\u2019s circumference. July 1, 2024 A new study spanning two decades of research may indicate a series of reefs from the surface to 150 meters deep in the Gulf of Mexico are more resilient to warmer oceans as they are exposed to a wider range of temperatures brought on by a physical movement of seawater called \u201ceddies.\u201d June 27, 2024 In May 2024, representatives from the Hurricane Modeling Team at NOAA\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) hosted a Summer Colloquium focused on equipping the next generation of hurricane scientists with a knowledge base of the HAFS model. June 4, 2024 With an active hurricane season on the horizon, the need for reliable hurricane forecasting is at the forefront of our minds. Heightened sea surface temperatures, weakened vertical wind shear, and an enhanced West African monsoon are expected to contribute to the development of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic. To predict these developing storms, meteorologists employ models that rely on current observations and mathematical calculations to predict a storm\u2019s behavior and track. These models are complex and utilize inputs from a variety of sources including historic, numeric, oceanic, and atmospheric data to generate their predictions. May 8, 2024 Blue lights fill the room. The faint smell of salt emanates throughout the space as wires and tubes intricately suspended over robotic arms move along custom-built tracks over four rows of tanks filled with seawater \u2013 and fragments of critically-endangered corals. In the Experimental Reef Lab, scientists at NOAA\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) and the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) are investigating how crucial reef-building coral species are affected by the impacts of climate change using a suite of open-source robotic arms designed and built at AOML.

Her [\u2026] February 13, 2024 Scientists at NOAA\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) are gearing up for a busy season at sea with three research cruises departing in the month of February. The A13.5 Global Ocean Ship-based Hydrographic Investigations Program (GO-SHIP) cruise, the I08S GO-SHIP cruise, and the Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) Northeast Extension cruise will all depart in February to collect samples from the surface to the depths of the ocean and improve our understanding of ocean circulation, carbon uptake, biological conditions, and climate variability. February 7, 2024 Congratulations to AOML\u2019s 2024 Department of Commerce Medal winners! AOML is proud to recognize the achievements of our outstanding scientists for their vital contributions to better understand the Earth systems and protecting our nation. January 25, 2024 Changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and its transport of heat can affect climate and weather patterns, regional sea levels, and ecosystems. A new study led by Ivenis Pita, a University of Miami PhD student working at NOAA\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory/ the Cooperative Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS), is the first to estimate the AMOC and heat transport at 22.5\u00b0S in the South Atlantic, demonstrating the importance of sustained in situ observations to monitor the state of the AMOC.

But a cellphone video filmed during Hurricane Ian's assault on southwest Florida isn't just another fish story. The eye-popping video, which showed a large, dark fish with sharp dorsal fins thrashing around an inundated Fort Myers backyard, racked up more than 12 million views on Twitter within a day, as users responded with disbelief and comparisons to the \"Sharknado\" film series. Dominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer, confirmed he filmed the clip from his back patio Wednesday morning when he saw something \"flopping around\" in his neighbor's flooded yard. \"I didn't know what it was -- it just looked like a fish or something,\" he told The Associated Press. \"I zoomed in, and all my friends are like, 'It's like a shark, man!'\" He guessed the fish was about four feet (1.2 metres) in length. Experts were of mixed opinion on whether the clip showed a shark or another large fish. George Burgess, former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History's shark program, said in an email that it \"appears to be a juvenile shark,\" while Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, director of the University of Miami's shark conservation program, wrote that \"it's pretty hard to tell.\" Nevertheless, some Twitter users dubbed the hapless fish the \"street shark.\" The surge worsened in Fort Myers as the day went on. Cameratta said the flooding had only just begun when the clip was taken, but that the waters were \"all the way up to our house\" by the time the AP reached him by phone Wednesday evening. He said the fish may have made its way up from nearby Hendry Creek into a retention pond, which then overflowed, spilling the creature into his neighbor's backyard. A visual analysis of nearby property confirmed it matches the physical landmarks in the video. Leslie Guelcher, a professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, was among the online sleuths who initially thought the video was fake. \"Don't think this is real. According to the index on the video it was created in June 2010. Someone else posted it at 10 AM as in Fort Myers, but the storm surge wasn't like that at 10 AM,\" she tweeted Wednesday. Guelcher acknowledged later, though, that online tools she and others were using to establish the video's origins didn't actually show when the video itself was created, merely when the social media profile of the user was created. The AP confirmed through the original clip's metadata that it was captured Wednesday morning. \"It makes a bit more sense from a flooding standpoint,\" she said by email, when informed the fish was spotted near an overflowing pond. \"But how on earth would a shark go from the Gulf of Mexico to a retention pond?\" Yannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, said that most sharks flee shallow bays ahead of hurricanes, possibly tipped off to their arrival by a change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he said, or been washed into it. \"Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters -- rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments -- and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,\" Burgess said. \"Assuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.\" Cameratta sent the video to a group chat on WhatsApp on Wednesday morning, according to his friend John Paul Murray, who sent the AP a timestamped screenshot. \"Amazing content,\" Murray wrote in reply. ------ Associated Press writers Philip Marcelo and Arijeta Lajka in New York contributed to this report.

                    "content": "Learn about what causes flooding, different types of floods\u2014and how to stay safe. Rain is pouring hard and fast\u2014more than eight inches in just an hour, turning river water brown with mud. Earthworms wiggle up to the ground as the soil becomes too wet for them. A flood might be coming. Just about any place on Earth can experience flooding. When so much rain falls that the ground can\u2019t absorb it or waterways can\u2019t hold it, the overflowing water becomes a destructive force. In the United States, flooding causes more death and damage than tornadoes, hurricanes, or lightning. During a rainstorm, precipitation\u2014or the water that comes from rain or snow\u2014goes to different places. Some of it flows into streams, lakes, or city water systems. Other precipitation evaporates and returns to the atmosphere. But much of the rainwater is absorbed by soil. It flows through the top layer of the ground, to plant roots below the surface. This helps provides plants with the water and nutrients they need to grow. The excess water moves deeper into the ground through layers of dirt and rocks where until it becomes part of natural underground wells called groundwater. A habitat can naturally absorb a healthy amount of rainfall it needs to thrive. But too much rain can cause lake and river levels to rise and overflow their banks, or the soil to become too wet to absorb more water. And though you might think extremely dry habitats would welcome too much rain, it turns out that the parched dirt can\u2019t absorb the rain fast enough to capture it all. Severe coastal storms, quickly melting ice and snow, and collapsed barriers (like concrete dams) can also cause floods. Even damaged beaver dams can lead to an overflow of water that the surrounding earth can\u2019t absorb. Floods can form slowly over several days or overwhelm an area with little warning. How quickly a flood forms often depends on the habitat. Slow-forming river flooding happens in regions called floodplains. These are large, flat areas of land along waterways with very shallow banks. When big storms hit, the water overflows the banks and spreads out across the plains. This type of flooding isn\u2019t always bad. It brings nutrients to the surrounding soil, making it fertile for growing crops. That\u2019s why many people live in or near floodplains. But too much water can destroy crops and damage homes. Rushing water can disrupt ecosystems by moving aquatic plants and animals to other habitats. And if flooding is so severe that it flows into local water treatment facilities, experts must monitor the incoming water to make sure the water is safe. Another type of flooding is called a flash flood, when a flood happens within six hours of a heavy rainfall\u2014as much as eight inches an hour. With no place to go, the moving water will tear through highways, valleys, and canyons, washing away vehicles, roads, bridges, and houses. Quickly melting ice and snow can also cause flash flooding, especially when mountain snowmelt overflows the waterways below. On coastlines, hurricane rains cause water levels to rise, and the high winds push that water onto land. Called a storm surge, this also causes flash flooding. Scientists believe that warming temperatures caused by climate change are increasing the risk of floods all over the world, especially in coastal and low-lying areas. Warmer water changes the patterns of ocean currents, which changes global weather patterns. This means that some places will receive more rainfall than the ground can absorb. Other places will get less rain so the land will be drier\u2014and unable to handle rainfall when it does occur. Scientists think that climate change could also cause stronger hurricanes, with more rain and higher winds causing bigger storm surges. A warmer climate could also mean more snowmelt overwhelming the soil; melting polar ice could cause sea levels to rise and increase flooding. (Find out how you can help slow climate change.) Experts might issue a flash flood watch if weather conditions are right. It doesn\u2019t mean flooding will happen but that meteorologists want people to be prepared. When experts are sure a flash flood is on the way, they issue a warning so people can evacuate immediately. Here\u2019s how to keep you and your family safe. Before a flood\u2022 Know your neighborhood. Research how close you are to streams, drainage channels, canyons, and any other low-lying areas that might flood.\u2022 Keep emergency contact phone numbers in one place so you can get in touch with family members.\u2022 Put together an evacuation plan and share it with everyone in your household. Know what paths and routes you can use to quickly get to a high, dry place.\u2022 Conduct flood drills to practice evacuating quickly.\u2022 Maintain an emergency kit with a three-day supply of food and water. Experts recommend canned or dried foods that don't need to be cooked, and at least one gallon of water per day for each person and pet. During a flood\u2022 Never wait for orders to leave; if you think a flood might be coming, evacuate immediately.\u2022 If flooding hasn\u2019t started, move important items to upper floors of your house.\u2022 If flooding has already started where you are, move to the highest place you can find, like a roof of a house or car. Bring as much food, water, and sheltering blankets as possible.\u2022 Never walk through flood water, especially if it\u2019s moving. Hazardous chemicals, sewage, and even wild animals are often in floodwater, and just six inches of moving water can knock you off your feet.\u2022 If you must walk through water to escape, walk where the water is still. Never touch electrical equipment if you are standing in water, or even if you\u2019re wet.\u2022 If water is quickly rising while you\u2019re in your car, leave your vehicle and move to higher ground, like a hill or bridge. After a flood\u2022 If you\u2019ve evacuated your house, return only after you\u2019re given the all-clear from officials.\u2022 If you stayed put, check ... [Content truncated]",

                    "content": "Photos and videos of sharks and other marine life swimming in suburban floodwaters make for popular hoaxes during massive storms. But a cellphone video filmed during Hurricane Ian\u2019s assault on southwest Florida isn\u2019t just another fish story.\nThe eye-popping video, which showed a large, dark fish with sharp dorsal fins thrashing around an inundated Fort Myers backyard, racked up more than 12 million views on Twitter within a day, as users responded with disbelief and comparisons to the \u201cSharknado\u201d film series.\nDominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer, confirmed he filmed the clip from his back patio Wednesday morning when he saw something \u201cflopping around\u201d in his neighbor\u2019s flooded yard.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what it was \u2014 it just looked like a fish or something,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cI zoomed in, and all my friends are like, \u2018It\u2019s like a shark, man!\u2019 \u201d\nHe guessed the fish was about 4 feet in length.\nA shark has been spotted in the streets of Fort Myers. Stay safe, Florida.  pic.twitter.com/7s8slr7Lnr\nExperts were of mixed opinion on whether the clip showed a shark or another large fish. George Burgess, former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History\u2019s shark program, said in an email that it \u201cappears to be a juvenile shark,\u201d while Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, director of the University of Miami\u2019s shark conservation program, wrote that \u201cit\u2019s pretty hard to tell.\u201d\nNevertheless, some Twitter users dubbed the hapless fish the \u201cstreet shark.\u201d\nThe surge\u00a0worsened in Fort Myers\u00a0as the day went on. Cameratta said the flooding had only just begun when the clip was taken, but that the waters were \u201call the way up to our house\u201d by the time the AP reached him by phone Wednesday evening.\nHe said the fish may have made its way up from nearby Hendry Creek into a retention pond, which then overflowed, spilling the creature into his neighbor\u2019s backyard. A visual analysis of nearby property confirmed it matches the physical landmarks in the video.\nLeslie Guelcher, a professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, was among the online sleuths who initially thought the video was fake.\n\u201cDon\u2019t think this is real. According to the index on the video it was created in June 2010. Someone else posted it at 10 AM as in Fort Myers, but the storm surge wasn\u2019t like that at 10 AM,\u201d she tweeted Wednesday.\nGuelcher acknowledged later, though, that online tools she and others were using to establish the video\u2019s origins didn\u2019t actually show when the video itself was created, merely when the social media profile of the user was created.\nThe AP confirmed through the original clip\u2019s metadata that it was captured Wednesday morning.\n\u201cIt makes a bit more sense from a flooding standpoint,\u201d she said by email, when informed the fish was spotted near an overflowing pond. \u201cBut how on earth would a shark go from the Gulf of Mexico to a retention pond?\u201d\nYannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, said that most sharks flee shallow bays ahead of hurricanes, possibly tipped off to their arrival by a change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he said, or been washed into it.\n\u201cYoung bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters \u2014 rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments \u2014 and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,\u201d Burgess said. \u201cAssuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.\u201d\nCameratta sent the video to a group chat on WhatsApp on Wednesday morning, according to his friend John Paul Murray, who sent the AP a timestamped screenshot.\n\u201cAmazing content,\u201d Murray wrote in reply.\nSign up for the\u00a0Fortune Features email list so you don\u2019t miss our biggest features, exclusive interviews, and investigations.\n\u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Kathy Hochul to declare a state of emergency as rising waters disrupted travel and stranded people in cars and homes. Michael Wilson and Hurubie Meko Heavy rainfall pounded New York City and the surrounding region on Friday, bringing flash floods, shutting down entire subway lines, turning major roadways into lakes and sending children to the upper floors of flooding schoolhouses. Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency, urging New Yorkers to stay home and singling out those who live in basements to brace for the worst. State and city leaders implored residents not to underestimate a storm that flipped from falling rain to fire-hose torrents in minutes. Ms. Hochul called it a \u201clife-threatening rainfall event,\u201d and Mayor Eric Adams called the storm \u201csomething that we cannot take lightly and we are not taking lightly.\u201d The city\u2019s residents, while largely caught by surprise, took heed and many stayed home and off the roads. Citywide cellphone pings pushed alerts from the National Weather Service throughout the day, repeatedly extending a \u201cconsiderable\u201d flash-flood warning, a level reserved for extreme and rare rainfall events. The warning remained in effect through the evening, and the governor cautioned at a news conference against driving despite a lull in the storm. The rain was unpredictable, she said, and it wasn\u2019t entirely clear what areas would be hardest hit overnight. Throughout the day, cascading waterfalls shut down subway lines across much of the city, with service being halted even at major hubs like Barclays Center. Trains were rerouted with little warning. \u201cI have no idea what\u2019s happening,\u201d one subway conductor said as her Q train moved onto the E line. \u201cI don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going.\u201d Commuters turned and ventured back home on foot through scenes of chaos and upheaval. Water gushed into brownstone basements in Park Slope. In Prospect Park, the landscape was altered by new creeks. In Queens, the storm was generational, making Friday the wettest day at Kennedy International Airport since modern record-keeping began. The streets in Windsor Terrace in Brooklyn, a neighborhood built on the slant of a hill, were engulfed in minutes in currents dotted with whitecaps, just as schools were opening their doors. Boys and girls slogged through deep water on 11th Avenue to reach their elementary school classes while neighbors with rakes tried to clear storm drains of dense fallen leaves. \u201cNo children are in danger as far as we know,\u201d the governor said. But some schools asked parents to return during the storm to pick up their children, which school officials later said was \u201cprecisely the wrong thing to do.\u201d \u201cTruthfully, holding school today knowing this was coming feels irresponsible,\u201d said Jessamyn Lee, a Brooklyn parent of two. By the end of the day, the overall attendance rate at public schools fell to roughly 77 percent, after hovering around 90 percent earlier this week. Several dozen schools across Brooklyn in particular saw more than 4 in 10 students absent. The sense that city leaders were largely caught off guard promised to linger after the rain had stopped falling. Mayor Adams was swiftly criticized for not warning residents about the storm soon enough, and for waiting to address New Yorkers until noontime Friday. Scenes both placid and fraught played out in the city, depending on how hard the rain was falling. Waist-high rivers appeared beneath arched bridges in Central Park. A man in a drenched business suit leaned on a fence by the Great Lawn, and removed his boots one at a time to empty them of water. In Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, a large tree fell, pulling its roots up through a sidewalk and cleaving a parked Nissan. In Windsor Terrace, Bryn Knowles, a former city parks employee in Lake Oswego, Ore., felt her instincts from that rain-soaked region kick in. She picked up a rake and went out to a blocked drain on the corner. \u201cEvery major rain event, all the city workers would drop all their tasks, grab their rakes and go and clear storm drains,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s fun \u2014 it\u2019s instant gratification, it helps people.\u201d Attention immediately turned to residents who live in flood zones, two years after the remnants of Hurricane Ida caused basement floods that killed 11 people in Queens. Many of those apartments, which are often rented to immigrants or others desperate for an affordable place to live, are not allowed to be rented legally and do not have adequate means of escape in a flood. \u201cPlan your escape route,\u201d Ms. Hochul said. \u201cDon\u2019t wait until water is over your knees before you leave. Don\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late.\u201d The rain on Friday made this the second-wettest September in New York City history, according to National Weather Service statistics: More than a foot of rain \u2014 over 14 inches \u2014 has fallen this month, the most in more than 140 years, when the city logged 16.85 inches in September 1882. The storm created havoc for the busiest streets and highways, flooding parts of the F.D.R. Drive and closing down the Belt Parkway. Many flights were canceled or delayed at Kennedy and La Guardia. Over the next few hours, the storm will gradually head east, said Dominic Ramunni, a Weather Service meteorologist. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Manhattan on the western edge of it now, with the heaviest rain over Queens and western Nassau County,\u201d he said. But he added, \u201cWe\u2019re still dealing with it: We still have that fire hose of moisture coming on shore.\u201d In the Central Park Zoo, the storm brought about an escape: The water rose so high that a female sea lion, named Sally, was able to breach her pool and venture out. She did not get far, with the zoo locked down and employees watching her carefully. Like many New Yorkers on Friday, Sally decided she was better off at home. \u201cShe explored the area before returning to the familiar surroundings of the pool,\u201d said Jim Breheny, an ...
