T​his article is no longer being updated. Here is Wednesday's live updates page. Wednesday morning will bring devastating scenes along parts of Florida's Gulf Coast. Hurricane Idalia was bearing down on the region overnight, with mandatory evacuations in at least 19 counties, roads flooding and the danger becoming increasingly more clear. T​he storm was projected to make landfall in North Florida with storm surge up to 16 feet, but brings the potential for flooding, wind and other impacts to communities on the east side of its path, including the Tampa Bay area. (​MORE: The Latest Forecast For Hurricane Idalia | Maps Tracker) H​ere are our live updates as the situation unfolded Tuesday: I​dalia is currently in the Gulf of Mexico, about 185 miles south of Tallahassee. The National Hurricane Center is forecasting it to be an extremely dangerous Category 4 storm at landfall in Florida's Big Bend region. If so, it would be the first Category 4 storm on record there. Storm surge could reach 12 feet to 16 feet. From weather.com digital meteorologist Jonathan Belles: Conditions across much of north Florida and southern Georgia will continue to deteriorate through the night and into the early morning hours. Bands of rain will become more frequent, winds will increase and water levels near the Gulf will also increase substantially. The worst conditions will most likely be in the Florida Big Bend near and just after sunrise. There will be several hours where it may be life-threatening to be outside of a sturdy structure as the core of the hurricane moves through. Wind gusts in a narrow corridor may eclipse 100 mph. A​bout 5,500 Florida National Guard troops have been mobilized, nearly half of the entire force. The activation includes personnel from the 111th Aviation Regiment based in Jacksonville. From weather.com senior meteorologist Jonathan Erdman: We've been able to see the hurricane's eye in radar imagery all day. Now the eye has cleared out in infrared satellite imagery. That's another sign it's intensifying. S​chools are closed until at least Thursday morning in 46 of Florida's 67 counties, according to a list compiled by the state Department of Education. The largest school districts among them include Brevard, Duval, Hillsborough, Lee, Orange, Pinellas and Polk. M​ore than 300 members of the Florida Highway Patrol are standing by to help escort utility crews and other emergency personnel after the storm passes, according to a social media post from Gov. Ron DeSantis. There 700 state Department of Transportation employees and 400 pieces of heavy equipment prepared to clear roadways. S​ome 4,000 inmates have been evacuated or relocated across Florida. According to an update from the state this evening: \"Evacuation determinations are made in the best interest of the public, staff and inmate safety. Multiple satellite facilities, community work release centers and work camps were evacuated in an abundance of caution. Inmates were relocated to larger main units (parent facilities), better equipped to weather the storm.\" T​he Florida capital city's airport will shut down at 11 p.m. eastern time tonight. Airports in Tampa, St. Petersburg-Clearwater and Sarasota have already closed. Sarasota plans to reopen tomorrow morning, pending damage assessments. St. Pete-Clearwater is expected to reopen at 3 p.m. tomorrow and Tampa anticipates remaining closed until Thursday morning. The center of the storm is about 245 miles south of Tallahassee, in the southern Gulf of Mexico. Wind gusts over 50 mph have been measured in some spots in southwest Florida. Maximum sustained winds are 105 mph, a slight increase in the past few hours. Six urban search and rescue team members from California are deploying to Orlando, Florida, and three to Atlanta, according to a statement from California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office. P​hotos from Sanibel Fire Rescue District showed waves crashing over a portion of the Sanibel Causeway in Southwest Florida. The causeway is still undergoing repairs after extensive damage from Hurricane Ian last year. Residents are being told to stay off the bridge during the storm. A​ mandatory evacuation order went into effect at 4:30 p.m. eastern time for everyone in Gilchrist County. The county, with a population of about 19,000 people, sits in a rural area between Gainesville and the Gulf of Mexico. P​ortions of at least 18 other counties are also under mandatory evacuation orders, mostly for areas or structures most vulnerable to flooding. They include: Citrus, Dixie, Franklin, Gilchrist, Gulf, Hillsborough, Jefferson, Lafayette, Leon, Levy, Manatee, Nassau, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, St. Johns, Suwannee, Taylor and Wakulla. From weather.com senior meteorologist Jonathan Erdman: We'll likely remember Idalia most for the prolific storm surge along Florida's Big Bend. In a few areas, Idalia's peak surge could exceed the up to 12-foot surge during the March 1993 Superstorm and the 10 to 13-foot surge during the Sept. 1896 hurricane. Time is running out. Water will rise overnight. We cannot stress enough how vital it is to evacuate, immediately, if you've been ordered to do so by local officials. You don't want to be there when a surge of that magnitude, with battering waves, arrives. It may be the last thing you ever do. All aircraft at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa have been evacuated or secured in preparation for Idalia. A video recorded by one of the planes evacuation captured a lightning phenomenon known as St. Elmo's Fire M​acDill Air Force Base is home to about 30 different aircraft, including a dozen KC-135 refuelers, according to the base website. About 6,600 military and civilian personnel are stationed there. It's located on a peninsula that juts into Tampa Bay south of the city's downtown. W​ith maximum sustained winds of 100 mph, Idalia has been upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane. The storm could strengthen more before landfall. H​urricanes are ranked one through five based on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. A Category 2 storm packs winds between 96 mph and 110 ... [Content truncated]",

Beyond the Data is written and edited by Derek Arndt, Jake Crouch, Jessica Blunden (NOAA NCEI), and Rebecca Lindsey (contractor to NOAA CPO). Posts reflect the views of the bloggers or guest contributors themselves, not necessarily those of Climate.gov, NOAA, or NCEI. The NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) has released the final update to its 2022 Billion-dollar disaster report (www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions), confirming another intense year of costly disasters and extremes throughout much of the country. 2022 tied 2017 and 2011 for the third highest number of billion-dollar disasters. 2022 was also third highest in total costs (behind 2017 and 2005), with a price tag of at least $165.0 billion. This total annual cost may rise by several billion when we’ve fully accounted for the costs of the December 21-26 Central and Eastern winter storm/cold wave.

For best viewing, click to see full-size versions of these images, or visit the NCEI web tool directly. In 2022, the U.S. experienced 18 separate weather and climate disasters costing at least 1 billion dollars. That number puts 2022 into a three-way tie with 2017 and 2011 for the third-highest number of billion-dollar disasters in a calendar year, behind the 22 events in 2020 and the 20 events in 2021. It was another year with a high diversity of destructive disasters: In 2022, the United States experienced 18 separate weather or climate disasters that each resulted in at least $1 billion in damages. NOAA map by NCEI. 2022 was also deadly, in that the 18 events of 2022 caused at least 474 direct or indirect fatalities—the 8th most disaster-related fatalities for the contiguous U.S. since 1980. Damages from the 2022 disasters totaled $165.1 billion. (All cost estimates are adjusted based on the Consumer Price Index, 2022). The costliest 2022 events were Hurricane Ian ($112.9 billion) and the Western and Central Drought / Heat Wave ($22.1 billion). Adding the 2022 events to the record that began in 1980, the U.S. has sustained 341 weather and climate disasters with the overall damage costs reaching or exceeding $1 billion. The cumulative cost for these 341 events exceeds $2.475 trillion. Like many years in the past decade, 2022 was another active year during which we had a high frequency, a high cost, and large diversity of extreme events that affect people's lives and livelihoods—concerning because it hints that the extremely high activity of recent years is becoming the new normal. 2022 (red line) marks the eighth consecutive year (2015-2022) in which 10 or more separate billion-dollar disaster events have impacted the U.S. The 1980–2022 annual average (black line) is 7.9 events (CPI-adjusted); the annual average for the most recent 5 years (2018–2022) is 17.8 events (CPI-adjusted). Month-by-month accumulation of billion-dollar disasters for each year on record. The colored lines represent the top 6 years for most billion-dollar disasters. All other years are colored light gray. NOAA image by NCEI. Over the last seven years (2016-2022), 122 separate billion-dollar disasters have killed at least 5,000 people and cost >$1 trillion in damage. In addition, the $100 billion cost figure has been eclipsed in 5 of the last six years (2017-2022 with 2019 being the exception). One of the drivers of this cost is that the U.S. has been impacted by landfalling Category 4 or 5 hurricanes in five of the last six years, including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, Michael, Laura, Ida, and Ian. Month-by-month accumulation of estimated costs of each year's billion-dollar disasters, with colored lines showing 2022 (red) and the previous top-5 costliest years. Other years are light gray. 2022 finished the year in third place for annual costs. NOAA NCEI graphic. In broader context, the total cost of U.S. billion-dollar disasters over the last 5 years (2018-2022) is $595.5 billion, with a 5-year annual cost average of $119.1 billion, the latter of which is nearly triple the 43-year inflation adjusted annual average cost. The U.S. billion-dollar disaster damage costs over the last 10-years (2013-2022) were also historically large: at least $1.1 trillion from 152 separate billion-dollar events. It is important to keep in mind that these estimates do not reflect the total cost of U.S. weather and climate disasters, only those associated with events more than $1 billion in damages. That means they are a conservative estimate of how much extreme weather costs the United States each year. However, these billion-dollar events do account for most of the damage from all recorded U.S. weather and climate events (NCEI; Munich Re), and they are becoming an increasingly larger percentage of the total damage costs from weather-related events at all scales and loss levels. The U.S. losses from billion-dollar disasters over the last seven years (2015-2022) are more than $1 trillion and have further skewed the total distribution of extreme weather costs. From 1980-2000, about 75% of all disaster-related costs were due to billion-dollar disasters, and by 2010, the percentage had risen to about 80%. By 2022, it has risen to ~85% of all disaster-related costs, or $2.475 trillion out of $2.850 trillion. The number and cost of weather and climate disasters are increasing in the United States due to a combination of increased exposure (i.e., more assets at risk), vulnerability (i.e., how much damage a hazard of given intensity—wind speed, or flood depth, for example—causes at a location), and the fact that climate change is increasing the frequency of some types of extremes that lead to billion-dollar disasters (NCA 2018, Chapter 2). The history of billion-dollar disasters in the United States each year from 1980 to 2022, showing event type (colors), frequency (left-hand vertical axis), and cost (right-hand vertical axis.) The number and cost of weather and climate disasters is rising due to a combination of population growth and development along with the influence of human-caused climate change on some ...

KEATON BEACH, Fla. – After Hurricane Idalia made its historic landfall along Florida's Gulf Coast, Idalia swamped Georgia and the Carolinas with flooding before its exit in the Atlantic Ocean. The Category 3 storm made landfall on the coast of Florida's Big Bend near Keaton Beach at 7:45 a.m. on Wednesday. With its 125 mph winds and significant flooding, it posed an immediate threat to lives and properties. The cyclone has since weakened to a tropical storm with winds of 60 mph as it lashes communities north of Charleston, S.C. FLORIDA HURRICANE IDALIA TRACKER: LIVE RADAR UPDATES, POWER OUTAGES, WATCHES AND WARNINGS AND STORM SURGE Dramatic video recorded in the eyewall of Hurricane Idalia shows trees and other debris flying through the air as the Category 3 hurricane was making landfall with 125 mph winds early Wednesday morning. While Governor Ron DeSantis told media Wednesday afternoon during a news conference that there were no confirmed fatalities, the Florida Highway Patrol said two men died in separate rain-related crashes in Gainesville and Pasco County due to Idalia. One man’s pickup truck swerved and crashed into a tree, while the other man lost control and hit a tree with his truck. DRONE VIDEO REVEALS DAMAGE, FLOODING FROM HURRICANE IDALIA LANDFALL NEAR KEATON BEACH The FOX Forecast Center said Idalia was the strongest hurricane to strike the Big Bend area – especially near Cedar Key – in 125 years, dating back to an unnamed 1896 storm. The governor said he believes Hurricane Ian was more deadly because of the path of the storm, and people evacuated when Idalia's storm surge was forecast to be between 10 and 15 feet. \"I can tell you with Hurricane Ian, as soon as that storm hit, within an hour after hitting, there were frantic phone calls to 911 locally there of people that were literally drowning in their house,\" DeSantis recalled of Lee County, Florida, where Ian made landfall. \"I think part of it is that when you see storm surge of that nature like we saw during Ian, I think a lot of people really heeded the warnings that their local officials issued because, you know, you can't hide from the storm surge in your house,\" DeSantis said. After lashing Florida’s Gulf Coast with threatening storm surge and extreme winds, Idalia rushed inland, triggering rare Extreme Wind Warnings for four counties north of the Big Bend, including a swath of Interstate 10. Idalia roared into southern Georgia still threatening hurricane-force gusts. Valdosta hit a gust of 67 mph and was under a rare Flash Flooding Emergency, the FOX Forecast Center reports. DRAMATIC PHOTOS, VIDEO CAPTURE HURRICANE IDALIA'S HISTORIC LANDFALL IN FLORIDA Before the monstrous storm's arrival, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) cautioned that Idalia's storm surge could reach heights of 16 feet in some locations near the storm center, setting modern records.

                    "content": "NWS All NOAA Privacy Policy Tampa Bay Area, FL Weather Forecast Office West Central and Southwest Florida Heavy Rainfall Event: June 10-13, 2024 As a tropical disturbance and surge of moisture lifted northward over portions of the Florida peninsula during the week of June 10th, several rounds of heavy rainfall occurred across West Central and Southwest Florida. Over the course of the week, many locations experienced significant heavy rainfall. Several daily (and even hourly) records were broken during the week. In some locations, much of this rainfall fell during a very short duration, leading to flooding. January 09, 2024 Severe Weather Event On January 09, 2024 a potent storm system moved across the Florida peninsula. As the storm system approached, a warm and humid air mass lifting northward over the state produced strong winds not associated with any storms. Just ahead of the cold front, a squall line pushed through the region producing an EF-1 tornado in Northern Hillsborough County, an EF-0 tornado in Pinellas County, and damaging straight-line winds in Sarasota County, FL. Gulf Low and Coastal Flooding Event on December 17, 2023 A wave of low pressure formed in the central Gulf of Mexico along the remnant stationary frontal boundary on Saturday, 16 December 2023, and moved northeast over the Florida peninsula on Sunday, 17 December 2023, bringing above normal water levels, particularly at high tide. Tornado Outbreak on October 11-12, 2023 Western Florida experienced one of its more significant tornado events during the evening of October 11th through the morning of October 12th. Six tornadoes affected the area, with 2 of them being significant (rated EF-2 or stronger) with maximum estimated winds of 115 and 125 mph. The first of the significant tornadoes moved across Pinellas County near Clearwater Beach and Dunedin, and the other near Crystal River in Citrus County. Elsewhere, EF-0 tornadoes affected Sarasota and Pasco counties, and another 2 hit parts of Pinellas County separate from the EF-2. The 6 total confirmed tornadoes represents the 8th most tornadoes in any single event for the area, and the event is tied for 15th when ranking events by total number of tornadoes. Fortunately, no fatalities or significant injuries were reported, which is especially remarkable given the strength of the tornadoes and the fact that most of them occurred during the overnight hours. Major Hurricane Idalia Hurricane Idalia began as a disorganized cluster of thunderstorms that moved across Central America from the Pacific Ocean and into the southern Caribbean Sea. On August 26, 2023, the system became Tropical Depression Ten and slowly continued to organize over the next few days while remaining almost stationary in the northwest Caribbean Sea. On August 27th, Tropical Depression Ten became Tropical Storm Idalia. By the early hours of August 28th, Idalia had become a hurricane and began to move towards the north. As Idalia moved north, the storm continued to intensify, eventually reaching category three strength as it made its final approach to the Florida peninsula on the morning of August 30, 2023. Tornadoes in Pasco→Hernando, Pinellas, and Sarasota Counties During the week of December 12, 2022, a powerful winter storm system moved eastward across the United States. Blizzard conditions developed in the Northern Plains, and a severe weather outbreak occurred across Texas, Oklahoma, and into the southeast United States. On December 15th, this storm system arrived in the vicinity of the Florida peninsula. Ushered along by the sharp change in temperature, a cold front moved into the region. Ahead of this front, a line of storms developed over the Gulf - bringing with it two EF1 tornadoes, an EF0 tornado, and some damaging wind gusts. Hurricane Nicole Hurricane Nicole first formed on November 7th as a sprawling low pressure system began to take on subtropical characteristics. As the system began to organize and the wind field contracted, Nicole became a Tropical Storm on Tuesday, November 8th. Nicole continued to intensify to a Category 1 Hurricane on November 9th after making landfall in the northern Bahamas. The storm would go on to make landfall along the Florida east coast near Vero Beach during the early morning hours of November 10th. Substantial impacts were felt along the east coast of the state as hurricane-force winds, heavy rainfall, and high surf battered the region of the coastline still reeling from Hurricane Ian. Some of this heavy rainfall and stronger wind also impacted West Central and Southwest Florida. Major Hurricane Ian Hurricane Ian started out as a tropical wave off the coast of Africa in mid-September. Over the course of a couple weeks, this disorganized wave would move westward, eventually arriving in the Caribbean Sea. On the morning of September 23rd, south of the the islands of Puerto Rico and Hispañola, Ian would become a tropical depression. Later that same day, tropical storm Ian would form. As Ian intensified in the Caribbean Sea, the storm made a northward turn and made landfall in western Cuba.

Fortunately, there were no reports of widespread damage.\nThe FOX Forecast Center said an area of low pressure rapidly organized as it approached the state, creating wind gusts to around 60 mph and the threat of severe weather.\nWind Advisories remain posted Sunday along the Atlantic coast of Florida. Wind gusts between 35 and 45 mph are possible throughout the day.\nThe gusty winds caused more than 25,000 power outages during the height of the storm, a threat that Florida Power & Light, the state's largest utility provider, said it was prepared for.\nA top concern of emergency managers was beach erosion and coastal flooding, especially in coastal communities impacted by Hurricane Ian and Hurricane Nicole.\nThe state activated what it calls the Florida State Guard to respond to any potential impacts.\nHoliday decorations in Fort Lauderdale were no match for Mother Nature. Before the worst of the weather arrived, decorations were strewn about in the area of the wharf.\nSeveral public Christmas events were canceled throughout the Florida Peninsula as communities prepared for the worst and hoped for the best.\nCHRISTMAS LAWN DECORATIONS ARE SOMETIMES NO MATCH FOR MOTHER NATURE\n\n        High winds knock over Christmas decorations in Fort Lauderdale\n        (@JHay97)\n\n        Florida is getting ready for tropical storm-like conditions as a storm system approaches.

Share sensitive information only on official, secure websites.\n              \nNOAA GOES satellite captures Hurricane Ian as it made landfall on the barrier island of Cayo Costa in southwest Florida on September 28, 2022. \nNOAA forecasters with the Climate Prediction Center, a division of the National Weather Service, predict near-normal hurricane activity in the Atlantic this year. NOAA’s outlook for the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season, which goes from June 1 to November 30, predicts a 40% chance of a near-normal season, a 30% chance of an above-normal season and a 30% chance of a below-normal season.\nNOAA is forecasting a range of 12 to 17 total named storms (winds of 39 mph or higher). Of those, 5 to 9 could become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher), including 1 to 4 major hurricanes (category 3, 4 or 5; with winds of 111 mph or higher). NOAA has a 70% confidence in these ranges.\n“Thanks to the Commerce Department and NOAA’s critical investments this year in scientific and technological advancements in hurricane modeling, NOAA will be able to deliver even more accurate forecasts, helping ensure communities have the information they need to prepare for and respond to the destructive economic and ecological impacts of Atlantic hurricanes,” said Secretary of Commerce Gina M. Raimondo.\nThe upcoming Atlantic hurricane season is expected to be less active than recent years, due to competing factors — some that suppress storm development and some that fuel it — driving this year's overall forecast for a near-normal season. \nAfter three hurricane seasons with La Nina present, NOAA scientists predict a high potential for El Nino to develop this summer, which can suppress Atlantic hurricane activity. El Nino’s potential influence on storm development could be offset by favorable conditions local to the tropical Atlantic Basin. Those conditions include the potential for an above-normal west African monsoon, which produces African easterly waves and seeds some of the stronger and longer-lived Atlantic storms, and warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea which creates more energy to fuel storm development. These factors are part of the longer term variability in Atlantic atmospheric and oceanic conditions that are conducive to hurricane development — known as the high-activity era for Atlantic hurricanes — which have been producing more active Atlantic hurricane seasons since 1995. \n“With a changing climate, the data and expertise NOAA provides to emergency managers and partners to support decision-making before, during and after a hurricane has never been more crucial,” said NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad, Ph.D. “To that end, this year we are operationalizing a new hurricane forecast model and extending the tropical cyclone outlook graphic from five to seven days, which will provide emergency managers and communities with more time to prepare for storms.”\nThis summer, NOAA will implement a series of upgrades and improvements. NOAA will expand the capacity of its operational supercomputing system by 20%. This increase in computing capability will enable NOAA to improve and run more complex forecast models, including significant model upgrades this hurricane season:\nAdditional upgrades or new tools for hurricane analysis and forecasting include:\nNOAA will continue improving new and current observing systems critical in understanding and forecasting hurricanes. Two projects underway this season include:\n“As we saw with Hurricane Ian, it only takes one hurricane to cause widespread devastation and upend lives. So regardless of the number of storms predicted this season, it is critical that everyone understand their risk and heed the warnings of state and local officials. Whether you live on the coast or further inland, hurricanes can cause serious impacts to everybody in their path,” said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. “Visit ready.gov or listo.gov for readiness resources, and get real time emergency alerts by downloading the FEMA App. Actions taken today can save your life when disaster strikes. The time to prepare is now.”\nNOAA’s outlook is for overall seasonal activity and is not a landfall forecast. In addition to the Atlantic seasonal outlook, NOAA also issues seasonal hurricane outlooks for the eastern Pacific and central Pacific hurricane basins. NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center will update the 2023 Atlantic seasonal outlook in early August, just prior to the historical peak of the season.\n \n \nMedia contact\nAllison Santorelli, (301) 427-9000",

                    "content": "Editor’s Note: Find the latest Hurricane Idalia coverage here. Hurricane Idalia could hit Florida’s west coast as an “extremely dangerous” Category 4 storm Wednesday morning, the National Hurricane Center warned as Idalia continued to intensify and churn toward the state late Tuesday. Officials across coastal communities repeatedly pleaded with residents Tuesday to immediately evacuate, stressing that high waters from the storm could prove deadly and first responders will not be able to help until the storm passes. But, desperate to save their homes and businesses and not leave others behind, some Floridians are staying put. “If you haven’t evacuated, you’re north of Fort Myers, you’re up into the central Gulf Coast, northern Big Bend area, if you have not evacuated, you need to do that right now. You need to drop what you’re doing, you need to go to your room, pack up, pack your things, and get to safety,” Florida Division of Emergency Management Executive Director Kevin Guthrie warned Tuesday evening. “We’re going to experience historical flood surge.” The storm was at Category 2 with sustained winds of up to 110 mph late Tuesday shortly before midnight, centered roughly 120 miles southwest of Florida’s Cedar Key, the hurricane center said. Its outer bands have been lashing Florida for hours, already causing flooding in some coastal areas. It’s expected to continue strengthening into a Category 4 hurricane – meaning sustained winds of at least 130 mph – before it reaches Florida’s Big Bend coast Wednesday morning. “Destructive life-threatening” winds will hit the area where Idalia’s core moves onshore, the hurricane center warned. Storm surge inundation of 12 to 16 feet above ground level – high enough to stack a wall of seawater halfway up the second floor of an average building – and destructive waves could be “catastrophic” between the Wakulla-Jefferson County line and Yankeetown, Florida, the center said. Strong wind will spread inland across northern Florida and southern Georgia near Idalia’s track, likely knocking out power along the way, the hurricane center said. “There is great potential for death and catastrophic devastation,” the Taylor County Sheriff’s Office warned on Tuesday, saying coastal residents were ordered to evacuate. “Storm surge on the coastal regions are projected as non-survivable.” The county, just southeast of the state capital, Tallahassee, is part of the Big Bend region. “That is storm surge that, if you’re there while that hits, it’s going to be very difficult to survive,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a Tuesday evening news conference. A tornado watch is also in effect for more than 7 million people across central and western Florida, including Tampa, until 6 a.m. Wednesday. Short-lived and usually weak tornadoes are often associated with the outer bands of tropical systems that make landfall. On the island city of Cedar Key, on the southern side of the Big Bend, Mayor Heath Davis urged residents under a mandatory evacuation order to leave immediately. Idalia is expected to rapidly intensify in the extremely warm Gulf of Mexico. Here's what that means “This storm is worse than we’ve ever seen. My family has been here for many generations, we haven’t seen a storm this bad, ever,” he said Tuesday. All emergency services will stop Tuesday evening as winds pick up, the mayor said, adding he does not want to put employees’ lives in danger. Cedar Key could be cut off by the high storm surge, National Hurricane Center Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said. FOLLOW HURRICANE IDALIA LIVE UPDATES Parts of Levy County, where Cedar Key is, could see “powerful battering waves” and life-threatening flooding, and many buildings could be damaged or washed away, the National Weather Service said. DeSantis stressed Tuesday that residents under evacuation orders should leave now, as weather conditions will only deteriorate. “If you do choose to stay in one of the evacuation zones, first responders will not be able to get you until after the storm has passed,” he added. Nearly 600 urban search and rescue personnel were prepared to be deployed to help in those efforts, the governor said. Storm surge was captured on video Tuesday by several residents across southwest Florida, including Fort Myers Beach, a community still reeling from the devastation it suffered last fall from Hurricane Ian – which leveled coastal Florida and left more than 100 dead. Florida resident Scott Martin shared a video on Facebook showing roads in Fort Myers Beach already flooded and the “storm hasn’t even hit,” he wrote. Track Idalia here >> Chase Norwood, whose family owns the Sea Hag Marina in Steinhatchee, has stayed behind despite warnings to leave, telling CNN’s John Berman the marina is “pretty much our livelihood.” The marina prides itself on being “one of the largest and most well-equipped marinas on Florida’s Big Bend,” according to its website. “We got to see the destruction Hurricane Ian did down in Fort Myers … We’ve seen stuff I didn’t know a storm could do, and so it was a real big eye-opener to my whole family,” Norwood said. “With the insurance and stuff, we’re all worried and that’s why we’re kind of staying here to see if there’s anything that we can do to protect what we have.” Lori Leigh Batts-Bennett already evacuated her condo in Steinhatchee, but told CNN Tuesday night many people chose to stay behind, hoping to protect their home and belongings. She says she’s worried about what the storm’s damage will mean for that community. “Steinhatchee does not have the infrastructure to handle these storms,” Batts-Bennett said. “I fear that if this is catastrophic, the people that make Steinhatchee will not be able to be in Steinhatchee because they wont be able to rebuild.” “The landscape of Steinhatchee will be changed forever,” she added. Residents should beware of flood risks, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell told “CNN This Morning” on Tuesday. “The No. 1 killer in all of these storms is water, whether it’s the storm surge that’s going to happen at the coast or the excessive rainfall that might happen inland ...
