        "Answer": "Based on the evidence provided, there is concrete evidence to support the claim of a shark swimming on a flooded highway during Hurricane Ian in Florida. The evidence includes:\n\n1. The Associated Press verified a video taken by Dominic Cameratta of a shark or other large fish swimming in flooded Fort Myers, Florida during Hurricane Ian in 2022 [Query 1_evidence_1····][Query 2_evidence_3····].\n\n2. Experts, including George Burgess and Neil Hammerschlag, analyzed the video and voiced mixed opinions on whether it was indeed a shark, with Burgess suggesting it appears to be a juvenile shark [Query 1_evidence_2····].\n\n3. The video was authenticated by Storyful and the Associated Press after reviewing the clip's metadata and conducting interviews with Dominic Cameratta, confirming its authenticity [Query 2_evidence_3····].\n\nConsidering the verification of the video, the expert analysis, and the confirmation of its authenticity, it can be concluded with high confidence (95%) that there is concrete evidence present in the video to substantiate the claim of a shark swimming on a flooded highway during Hurricane Ian in Florida.",

The video was first authenticated by Storyful and the Associated Press, who interviewed Dominic Cameratta and reviewed the metadata of the clip. Expert analysis by individuals such as George Burgess and Neil Hammerschlag also provided insights, with Burgess suggesting it appears to be a juvenile shark.",

        "Question": "Has the local wildlife or environmental department in Florida issued any statements regarding the presence of a shark on the flooded highway during Hurricane Ian?",
        "Answer": "Based on this evidence, it can be inferred that while the FWC did not specifically mention a shark swimming on the flooded highway during Hurricane Ian, their warning about wildlife becoming more active during major storms indirectly implies the possibility of marine animals like sharks being displaced. Therefore, it is likely that the local wildlife or environmental department in Florida did not issue a specific statement regarding the presence of a shark on the flooded highway during Hurricane Ian.",
