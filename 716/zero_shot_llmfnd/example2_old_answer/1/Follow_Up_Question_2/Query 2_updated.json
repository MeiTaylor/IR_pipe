                    "content": "Please enable JavaScript in your web browser to get the best experience. Tom Johansmeyer Published 20 February 2023 The weaponisation of information is nothing new. Foreign influence operations involving Brexit and the 2016 U.S. presidential election are recent high-profile examples of a much larger problem. The targeted use of information operations has permeated society and will only grow with time. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not our only problem. Thanks to climate change, more natural disasters are coming, and they\u2019re becoming more powerful and more impactful. The disaster-disinformation nexus offers unique conditions for powerful and frequent influence campaigns against communities at their most vulnerable. And while this hasn\u2019t been a large problem yet, indicators of its coming abound. People seek stability and reliability during periods of uncertainty, and they will often take anything that looks helpful, seems to make sense, or otherwise fills a void. Absent the perfect, it seems, anything will suffice. Consequently, disinformation is common following major natural disasters. The rise of social media makes it easier for convenient \u2013 if not true \u2013 information to spread rapidly and take on a life of its own. Although the rumour and fiction that forms and spread after a natural disaster can often be harmless, there are cases where disinformation can impede rescue and relief efforts. Before turning to the grave, let\u2019s consider the absurd. Hurricane Irma, in 2017, reportedly led to the displacement of sharks onto a Florida highway. The same story \u2013 and image \u2013 made the rounds after Hurricanes Harvey and Florence. Hurricane sharks are as common as they are false. The risk of highway sharks may not be terribly significant, especially if highways are so flooded as to be unusable. The thought of sharks on the interstate is good for a laugh \u2013 and moment of reflection on what people will actually believe. Unfortunately, though, there is a dark side to disaster information. False and inaccurate reports can impede rescue and relief efforts cost people their lives. This happened in the Indian state of Kerala in 2018. Fake video circulated during the flooding event interfered with rescue operations. Fake news in Mali disrupted United Nations missions, and in 2005, exaggerated reports of looting and other violence interfered with Hurricane Katrina response efforts. Preparations and planning are already being discussed for ways to counteract the growing post-disaster disinformation threat. Fake news has real-world consequences, and the stakes are about to go up. Historical cases of disaster-related disinformation generally have been more grassroots than from outside influence and state actors, but that\u2019s about to change. Foreign influence operations have already been deployed to considerable effect during periods of vulnerability generally, if not disasters specifically \u2013 from elections to civil unrest. The increasing cadence of major natural disasters due to climate change could offer more opportunities for the weaponization of foreign influence, especially when communities are weakened and local institutions are strained. Let\u2019s go back to those hurricane sharks. The disinformation that circulated online following the 2017 and 2018 hurricanes appears simply to have been a hoax \u2013 just a manipulated video of sharks swimming on the highway. Hurricane Ian brought that same shark to Fort Myers, Florida, in 2022. This time, coverage appeared in Sputnik News (Warning: Not a credible source of information, linked here), a known foreign government-sponsored source of disinformation. Beyond the highway sharks, Sputnik News sought to advance a narrative of ineffective government response following the hurricane (Warning, not credible, linked here), a clear case of post-disaster foreign influence, even if on a small scale. The weaponization of post-disaster disinformation and influence isn\u2019t limited to the Gulf of Mexico. It\u2019s a worldwide problem. Foreign influence has found traction with the drought in currently in Moldova, with foreign influence used to create wedges between semi-autonomous regions Transnistria and Gagauzia and the government in Chisinau. News coverage critical of the country\u2019s government is using issues such as economic and energy insecurity to foment civil unrest in a part of the world already experiencing destabilization. The disaster-disinformation nexus in Moldova may seem too small to follow closely \u2013 the country has only 3 million people \u2013 but global effects could follow. Today\u2019s interference could support the development of a playbook for post-disaster disinformation and influence, adding scale to this budding problem. The world\u2019s disinformation plague is vast and complex, defying simple, direct, and easily implemented solutions. Within the disaster-disinformation nexus, however, it may be more manageable. Specific, contextually relevant steps can be taken to curb the impact of disinformation and foreign influence on communities affected by natural disasters. And frankly, there\u2019s no substitute for real life. Consider the Sputnik News story alleging that the government had abandoned the victims of Hurricane Ian. The situation on the ground was clearly far different from the allegation. Rebuilding a community (even a household) after a disaster is a trying time, but there is a lot of mileage between challenging circumstances and government abandonment. Relief supplies and professionals were engaged as soon as possible to help effect a swift and orderly recovery. A strong disaster response plan may not be enough to neutralise disinformation after a natural disaster, but it certainly makes a difference. Access to basic necessities and visual proof of progress makes it much harder for the trolls to do their job. *The views expressed herein are those of the author, based on research conducted by the author, and may not necessarily represent the views of others unless otherwise noted.

                    "content": "Photos and videos of sharks and other marine life swimming in suburban floodwaters make for popular hoaxes during massive storms. But a cellphone video filmed during Hurricane Ian\u2019s assault on southwest Florida isn\u2019t just another fish story.\nThe eye-popping video, which showed a large, dark fish with sharp dorsal fins thrashing around an inundated Fort Myers backyard, racked up more than 12 million views on Twitter within a day, as users responded with disbelief and comparisons to the \u201cSharknado\u201d film series.\nDominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer, confirmed he filmed the clip from his back patio Wednesday morning when he saw something \u201cflopping around\u201d in his neighbor\u2019s flooded yard.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what it was \u2014 it just looked like a fish or something,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cI zoomed in, and all my friends are like, \u2018It\u2019s like a shark, man!\u2019 \u201d\nHe guessed the fish was about 4 feet in length.\nA shark has been spotted in the streets of Fort Myers. Stay safe, Florida.  pic.twitter.com/7s8slr7Lnr\nExperts were of mixed opinion on whether the clip showed a shark or another large fish. George Burgess, former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History\u2019s shark program, said in an email that it \u201cappears to be a juvenile shark,\u201d while Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, director of the University of Miami\u2019s shark conservation program, wrote that \u201cit\u2019s pretty hard to tell.\u201d\nNevertheless, some Twitter users dubbed the hapless fish the \u201cstreet shark.\u201d\nThe surge\u00a0worsened in Fort Myers\u00a0as the day went on. Cameratta said the flooding had only just begun when the clip was taken, but that the waters were \u201call the way up to our house\u201d by the time the AP reached him by phone Wednesday evening.\nHe said the fish may have made its way up from nearby Hendry Creek into a retention pond, which then overflowed, spilling the creature into his neighbor\u2019s backyard. A visual analysis of nearby property confirmed it matches the physical landmarks in the video.\nLeslie Guelcher, a professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, was among the online sleuths who initially thought the video was fake.\n\u201cDon\u2019t think this is real. According to the index on the video it was created in June 2010. Someone else posted it at 10 AM as in Fort Myers, but the storm surge wasn\u2019t like that at 10 AM,\u201d she tweeted Wednesday.\nGuelcher acknowledged later, though, that online tools she and others were using to establish the video\u2019s origins didn\u2019t actually show when the video itself was created, merely when the social media profile of the user was created.\nThe AP confirmed through the original clip\u2019s metadata that it was captured Wednesday morning.\n\u201cIt makes a bit more sense from a flooding standpoint,\u201d she said by email, when informed the fish was spotted near an overflowing pond. \u201cBut how on earth would a shark go from the Gulf of Mexico to a retention pond?\u201d\nYannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, said that most sharks flee shallow bays ahead of hurricanes, possibly tipped off to their arrival by a change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he said, or been washed into it.\n\u201cYoung bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters \u2014 rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments \u2014 and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,\u201d Burgess said. \u201cAssuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.\u201d\nCameratta sent the video to a group chat on WhatsApp on Wednesday morning, according to his friend John Paul Murray, who sent the AP a timestamped screenshot.\n\u201cAmazing content,\u201d Murray wrote in reply.\nSign up for the\u00a0Fortune Features email list so you don\u2019t miss our biggest features, exclusive interviews, and investigations.\n\u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

In December 2021, the most destructive winter tornado outbreak, known as the Quad-State Tornado Outbreak, caused 89 fatalities, 672 injuries, and at least $3.9 billion in property damages. Scientists at the University of Miami\u2019s Cooperative Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) and NOAA\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) investigated this outbreak and found that it occurred under an exceptionally strong and prolonged negative Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern, which created favorable conditions for tornado outbreaks. July 2, 2024 Tropical Cyclone Freddy breaks records as the longest-lasting cyclone on record. Spanning 36 days, it traveled from the Australia to Africa, nearly 33% of the Earth\u2019s circumference. July 1, 2024 A new study spanning two decades of research may indicate a series of reefs from the surface to 150 meters deep in the Gulf of Mexico are more resilient to warmer oceans as they are exposed to a wider range of temperatures brought on by a physical movement of seawater called \u201ceddies.\u201d June 27, 2024 In May 2024, representatives from the Hurricane Modeling Team at NOAA\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) hosted a Summer Colloquium focused on equipping the next generation of hurricane scientists with a knowledge base of the HAFS model. June 4, 2024 With an active hurricane season on the horizon, the need for reliable hurricane forecasting is at the forefront of our minds. Heightened sea surface temperatures, weakened vertical wind shear, and an enhanced West African monsoon are expected to contribute to the development of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic. To predict these developing storms, meteorologists employ models that rely on current observations and mathematical calculations to predict a storm\u2019s behavior and track. These models are complex and utilize inputs from a variety of sources including historic, numeric, oceanic, and atmospheric data to generate their predictions. May 8, 2024 Blue lights fill the room. The faint smell of salt emanates throughout the space as wires and tubes intricately suspended over robotic arms move along custom-built tracks over four rows of tanks filled with seawater \u2013 and fragments of critically-endangered corals. In the Experimental Reef Lab, scientists at NOAA\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) and the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) are investigating how crucial reef-building coral species are affected by the impacts of climate change using a suite of open-source robotic arms designed and built at AOML. May 2, 2024 Floating ice, freezing temperatures, and streaks of lights in the night sky. The I08S GO-SHIP cruise successfully concluded on April 1st. April 30, 2024 Improvements in the operational Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting Model paved the way for tropical cyclone prediction and modeling by lowering intensity forecast errors by 45-50%. April 22, 2024 Wind, waves, and icebergs pierced through morning fog \u2013 the A13.5 GO-SHIP cruise proved both tumultuous and rewarding with vast amounts of new data that bring the promise of groundbreaking future research. After 52 days at sea, the A13.5 GO-SHIP cruise (short for \u201cGlobal Ocean Ship-based Hydrographical Investigations Program\u201d) returned to Cape Town, South Africa [\u2026] April 18, 2024 Just in! A new study, which analyzed mooring observations and hydrographic data, found the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) abyssal limb in the North Atlantic has weakened over the past two decades contributing to sea level rise in the region. March 19, 2024 In a groundbreaking new study, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) scientists unveiled a significant advancement in hurricane tracking and forecasting. The study, named \u201cThe G-IV Inner Circumnavigation: A Story of Successful Organic Interactions Between Research and Operations at NOAA,\u201d discusses how scientists across NOAA are improving hurricane forecasts through the effective use of NOAA [\u2026] March 18, 2024 Chris Kelble, Ph.D. will serve as a Federal Coordinating Lead Author on first-ever National Nature Assessment (NAA). March 12, 2024 Meet NOAA Corps Officer, LTJG Anna Gaskill In honor of Women\u2019s History Month, NOAA\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) spoke with our NOAA Corps Officer, LTJG Anna Gaskill, about her career at NOAA and her advice for women considering opportunities with the NOAA Corps. Anna currently serves as the AOML Operations Manager, primarily coordinating [\u2026] February 15, 2024 In honor of Black History Month, NOAA\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) spoke with Oceanographer Kayelyn Simmons, PhD, about her role at AOML and what Black History Month means to her. Kayelyn is a federal oceanographer at AOML, leading benthic habitat characterization studies using 3D mapping with the Ocean Chemistry and Ecosystems Division. Her [\u2026] February 13, 2024 Scientists at NOAA\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) are gearing up for a busy season at sea with three research cruises departing in the month of February. The A13.5 Global Ocean Ship-based Hydrographic Investigations Program (GO-SHIP) cruise, the I08S GO-SHIP cruise, and the Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) Northeast Extension cruise will all depart in February to collect samples from the surface to the depths of the ocean and improve our understanding of ocean circulation, carbon uptake, biological conditions, and climate variability. February 7, 2024 Congratulations to AOML\u2019s 2024 Department of Commerce Medal winners! AOML is proud to recognize the achievements of our outstanding scientists for their vital contributions to better understand the Earth systems and protecting our nation. January 25, 2024 Changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and its transport of heat can affect climate and weather patterns, regional sea levels, and ecosystems. A new study led by Ivenis Pita, a University of Miami PhD student working at NOAA\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory/ the Cooperative Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS), is the first to estimate the AMOC and heat transport at 22.5\u00b0S in the South Atlantic, demonstrating the importance of sustained in situ observations to monitor the state of the AMOC.

                    "content": "FOLLOW ON\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Associated Press\nStaff\n\n\nContact\n\nWASHINGTON -- \n\tU.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday said \"our entire country hurts\" along with the people of Florida after Hurricane Ian flooded communities across the state, knocked out power, forced people into shelters and raised fears of a \"substantial loss of life.\"\n\n\tBiden said the storm could up as the \"deadliest hurricane in Florida's history.\"\n\n\tDuring a visit to the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, where he was briefed on federal response efforts, the president said, \"The numbers are still unclear, but we're hearing early reports of what may be substantial loss of life.\"\n\n\tBiden said he would visit Florida and meet with Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis when \"conditions allow.\" The president said he would also visit Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, that was slammed earlier this month by Hurricane Fiona.\n\n\t\"We know many families are hurting,\" Biden said at FEMA's National Response Coordination Center, where teams of specialists from across the federal government and partner organizations were monitoring the storm and assisting in recovery efforts. \"Our entire country hurts with them.'\n\n\tHe urged those affected by Ian to take seriously the warnings from local officials to stay safe and remain indoors.\n\n\t\"Don't go outside unless you have to,\" Biden said. \"The danger is real, to state the obvious. Please obey all warnings and direction from emergency officials.\"\n\n\tBiden and DeSantis spoke before the hurricane hit and again Thursday morning as the destruction began to come into focus. Ian made landfall as one of the strongest hurricanes ever in the United States. The storm flooded homes on Florida's coasts, cut off the only bridge to a barrier island, destroyed a historic waterfront pier and knocked out electricity to 2.67 million homes and businesses. At least one man was confirmed dead.\n\n\tBiden declared a major disaster in parts of Florida early Thursday at DeSantis' request, freeing up additional federal assistance to state and local governments and individuals. FEMA Admnistrator Deanne Criswell said more counties would likely be added to the disaster declaration as assessments were carried out.\n\n\tAsked if his administration would need additional money from Congress to respond to the storm, Biden said, \"We may.\"\n\n\tBiden said DeSantis, with whom he has squabbled politically, was \"extremely happy\" with the federal response. The president said \"this is not about anything having to do with our disagreements politically. This is about saving people's lives, homes and businesses.\"\n\n\tBiden said he also had talked with several Florida mayors on Thursday and delivered the same message he shared with the governor about the federal government's commitment to helping with the cleanup and with rebuilding: \"We are here.\"\n\n\t\"We're going to do everything we can to provide everything they need,\" Biden said, adding that his instruction to them was to call him directly at the White House with their needs. \"They know how to do that.\"\n\n\tBiden also spoke to the people of Puerto Rico, who are cleaning up and trying to rebuild after Hurricane Fiona ravaged the U.S. island territory before Ian pummeled Florida on Wednesday.\n\n\t\"I'm committed to you and the recovery of the island,\" he said. \"We've not gone away.\"\nU.S. President Joe Biden, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas\u00c2\u00a0arrive for a briefing about the impact of Hurricane Ian during a visit to FEMA headquarters, Thursday, Sept. 29, 2022, in Washington.
