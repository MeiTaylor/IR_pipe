Bibliography 1711-2013 (note the papers listed in Published Accounts have updated bibliographies and contain references not found here). 4. Published Accounts The families Adrianichthyidae (Oryzias latipes), Percichthyidae (Morone saxatilis), Centrarchidae (Lepomis macrochirus and Micropterus salmoides), Mullidae (Mullus barbatus), Scophthalmidae (Psetta maxima) and Pleuronectidae (Platichthys flesus) are deleted from this work as the species therein have not been confirmed from Iran (see Coad and Abdoli (1993b) for some details). Revised sections of this website appeared as review articles in the Iranian Journal of Ichthyology (http://ijichthyol.org/) and the International Journal of Aquatic Biology (www. ij-aquaticbiology.com), both published by the Iranian Society of Ichthyology. These families are no longer accessible here and will not be updated further. Note that the species formerly in the family Cyprinidae are now assigned to seven families in Iran. The less speciose families are published as journal articles. The two largest families (carps or Cyprinidae and minnows or Leuciscidae) appear here as downloadable files. A more permanent home will eventually be found these latter two as their size precludes publishing in book form for cost reasons (both to produce the books and their probable retail price).

Some sections of this work are incomplete but have been posted as is. They will be updated and queries resolved as time permits. Apart from files not yet complete, distribution maps, some figures and habitat photographs are the main items to be added. A question mark may appear in the text appended to items that need to be checked by me. Numerous queries have led me to post incomplete material. This work has been carried out over a period of 45 years, starting in 1971. I arrived in Iran in January 1976 and, in that year, 7 articles were published strictly on Iranian fishes (3 on parasites, 1 on pesticides, 1 on fisheries, 1 describing the blind white fish and 1 a summary of the latter; 2 were in Farsi). A generation later in 2006, over 160 articles on Iranian fishes appeared, along with hundreds of relevant works from neighbouring countries, works on the aquatic environment in Iran and works on taxonomy and systematics relevant to Iran. The study of fishes is now a very active field within Iran and the Middle East and much of the newer literature is easily available on-line (see Bibliography). Accordingly, 2011 is the last year that this work was updated although some systematic and taxonomic studies may still be incorporated. The Published Accounts (see above) were updated versions from content in this website. Acknowledgements A wide range of people in Iran, Canada and elsewhere have assisted me in this work over more than 40 years. Inevitably, I will have forgotten some names, which I regret. Some people I never met formally, an example being the gentleman nattily dressed in suit by a stream near Kazerun who jumped fully-clothed into the water to help me catch fish. Numerous other Iranians have assisted my studies and this website is dedicated to them. The staff at the Department of Biology, Shiraz (then Pahlavi) ... [Content truncated]",
