But an A.P. analysis and experts say a wayward finned creature was indeed captured on video swimming on a street in Fort Myers, Fla., this week.\nBy Daniel Victor\nTo professional fact-checkers who sort fact from fable on social media, Hurricane Shark has been a longtime nemesis.\nFor more than a decade, fake, grainy images of a shark swimming in waters it doesn\u2019t belong in \u2014 usually a highway and a subway platform \u2014 have reliably circulated during nearly every major storm.\nIt was never real. Yet it kept coming up, shared without skepticism yet again, and the checkers of facts were forced to defeat it again, over and over.\nSo you can imagine their hesitant surprise when a new video emerged on Wednesday appearing to show a shark in a backyard near Fort Myers, Fla., which had been battered by Hurricane Ian and was beginning to flood. Though this video didn\u2019t have the telltale signs of fakery that previous versions did, skepticism was warranted as it racked up millions of views on Twitter.\nThen evidence began emerging that it might actually be real. And on Thursday, both Storyful, a news agency, and The Associated Press confirmed its authenticity with interviews and examinations of the original clip\u2019s metadata, nailing down a story reporters thought they would never write.\nIt was like discovering Bigfoot is real.\n\u201cAfter over half a decade of debunking this hoax every time there was a flood or hurricane, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m looking at an honest-to-god street shark,\u201d wrote Jane Lytvynenko, a freelance reporter. \u201cGood to finally meet you, pal.\u201d\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Foreign influence operations involving Brexit and the 2016 U.S. presidential election are recent high-profile examples of a much larger problem. The targeted use of information operations has permeated society and will only grow with time. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not our only problem. Thanks to climate change, more natural disasters are coming, and they\u2019re becoming more powerful and more impactful. The disaster-disinformation nexus offers unique conditions for powerful and frequent influence campaigns against communities at their most vulnerable. And while this hasn\u2019t been a large problem yet, indicators of its coming abound. People seek stability and reliability during periods of uncertainty, and they will often take anything that looks helpful, seems to make sense, or otherwise fills a void. Absent the perfect, it seems, anything will suffice. Consequently, disinformation is common following major natural disasters. The rise of social media makes it easier for convenient \u2013 if not true \u2013 information to spread rapidly and take on a life of its own. Although the rumour and fiction that forms and spread after a natural disaster can often be harmless, there are cases where disinformation can impede rescue and relief efforts. Before turning to the grave, let\u2019s consider the absurd. Hurricane Irma, in 2017, reportedly led to the displacement of sharks onto a Florida highway. The same story \u2013 and image \u2013 made the rounds after Hurricanes Harvey and Florence. Hurricane sharks are as common as they are false. The risk of highway sharks may not be terribly significant, especially if highways are so flooded as to be unusable. The thought of sharks on the interstate is good for a laugh \u2013 and moment of reflection on what people will actually believe. Unfortunately, though, there is a dark side to disaster information. False and inaccurate reports can impede rescue and relief efforts cost people their lives. This happened in the Indian state of Kerala in 2018. Fake video circulated during the flooding event interfered with rescue operations. Fake news in Mali disrupted United Nations missions, and in 2005, exaggerated reports of looting and other violence interfered with Hurricane Katrina response efforts. Preparations and planning are already being discussed for ways to counteract the growing post-disaster disinformation threat. Fake news has real-world consequences, and the stakes are about to go up. Historical cases of disaster-related disinformation generally have been more grassroots than from outside influence and state actors, but that\u2019s about to change. Foreign influence operations have already been deployed to considerable effect during periods of vulnerability generally, if not disasters specifically \u2013 from elections to civil unrest. The increasing cadence of major natural disasters due to climate change could offer more opportunities for the weaponization of foreign influence, especially when communities are weakened and local institutions are strained. Let\u2019s go back to those hurricane sharks. The disinformation that circulated online following the 2017 and 2018 hurricanes appears simply to have been a hoax \u2013 just a manipulated video of sharks swimming on the highway. Hurricane Ian brought that same shark to Fort Myers, Florida, in 2022. This time, coverage appeared in Sputnik News (Warning: Not a credible source of information, linked here), a known foreign government-sponsored source of disinformation. Beyond the highway sharks, Sputnik News sought to advance a narrative of ineffective government response following the hurricane (Warning, not credible, linked here), a clear case of post-disaster foreign influence, even if on a small scale. The weaponization of post-disaster disinformation and influence isn\u2019t limited to the Gulf of Mexico. It\u2019s a worldwide problem. Foreign influence has found traction with the drought in currently in Moldova, with foreign influence used to create wedges between semi-autonomous regions Transnistria and Gagauzia and the government in Chisinau. News coverage critical of the country\u2019s government is using issues such as economic and energy insecurity to foment civil unrest in a part of the world already experiencing destabilization. The disaster-disinformation nexus in Moldova may seem too small to follow closely \u2013 the country has only 3 million people \u2013 but global effects could follow. Today\u2019s interference could support the development of a playbook for post-disaster disinformation and influence, adding scale to this budding problem. The world\u2019s disinformation plague is vast and complex, defying simple, direct, and easily implemented solutions. Within the disaster-disinformation nexus, however, it may be more manageable. Specific, contextually relevant steps can be taken to curb the impact of disinformation and foreign influence on communities affected by natural disasters. And frankly, there\u2019s no substitute for real life. Consider the Sputnik News story alleging that the government had abandoned the victims of Hurricane Ian. The situation on the ground was clearly far different from the allegation. Rebuilding a community (even a household) after a disaster is a trying time, but there is a lot of mileage between challenging circumstances and government abandonment. Relief supplies and professionals were engaged as soon as possible to help effect a swift and orderly recovery. A strong disaster response plan may not be enough to neutralise disinformation after a natural disaster, but it certainly makes a difference. Access to basic necessities and visual proof of progress makes it much harder for the trolls to do their job. *The views expressed herein are those of the author, based on research conducted by the author, and may not necessarily represent the views of others unless otherwise noted.

But a cellphone video filmed during Hurricane Ian's assault on southwest Florida isn't just another fish story. The eye-popping video, which showed a large, dark fish with sharp dorsal fins thrashing around an inundated Fort Myers backyard, racked up more than 12 million views on Twitter within a day, as users responded with disbelief and comparisons to the \"Sharknado\" film series. Dominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer, confirmed he filmed the clip from his back patio Wednesday morning when he saw something \"flopping around\" in his neighbor's flooded yard. \"I didn't know what it was -- it just looked like a fish or something,\" he told The Associated Press. \"I zoomed in, and all my friends are like, 'It's like a shark, man!'\" He guessed the fish was about four feet (1.2 metres) in length. Experts were of mixed opinion on whether the clip showed a shark or another large fish. George Burgess, former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History's shark program, said in an email that it \"appears to be a juvenile shark,\" while Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, director of the University of Miami's shark conservation program, wrote that \"it's pretty hard to tell.\" Nevertheless, some Twitter users dubbed the hapless fish the \"street shark.\" The surge worsened in Fort Myers as the day went on. Cameratta said the flooding had only just begun when the clip was taken, but that the waters were \"all the way up to our house\" by the time the AP reached him by phone Wednesday evening. He said the fish may have made its way up from nearby Hendry Creek into a retention pond, which then overflowed, spilling the creature into his neighbor's backyard. A visual analysis of nearby property confirmed it matches the physical landmarks in the video. Leslie Guelcher, a professor of intelligence studies at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, was among the online sleuths who initially thought the video was fake. \"Don't think this is real. According to the index on the video it was created in June 2010. Someone else posted it at 10 AM as in Fort Myers, but the storm surge wasn't like that at 10 AM,\" she tweeted Wednesday. Guelcher acknowledged later, though, that online tools she and others were using to establish the video's origins didn't actually show when the video itself was created, merely when the social media profile of the user was created. The AP confirmed through the original clip's metadata that it was captured Wednesday morning. \"It makes a bit more sense from a flooding standpoint,\" she said by email, when informed the fish was spotted near an overflowing pond. \"But how on earth would a shark go from the Gulf of Mexico to a retention pond?\" Yannis Papastamatiou, a marine biologist who studies shark behavior at Florida International University, said that most sharks flee shallow bays ahead of hurricanes, possibly tipped off to their arrival by a change in barometric pressure. A shark could have accidentally swum up into the creek, he said, or been washed into it. \"Young bull sharks are common inhabitants of low salinity waters -- rivers, estuaries, subtropical embayments -- and often appear in similar videos in FL water bodies connected to the sea such as coastal canals and ponds,\" Burgess said. \"Assuming the location and date attributes are correct, it is likely this shark was swept shoreward with the rising seas.\" Cameratta sent the video to a group chat on WhatsApp on Wednesday morning, according to his friend John Paul Murray, who sent the AP a timestamped screenshot. \"Amazing content,\" Murray wrote in reply. ------ Associated Press writers Philip Marcelo and Arijeta Lajka in New York contributed to this report. The U.S. federal judge presiding over the classified documents case of former president Donald Trump in Florida dismissed the prosecution on Monday, siding with defence lawyers who said the special counsel who filed the charges was illegally appointed. Former U.S. president Donald Trump called for unity and resilience after an attempt on his life injected fresh uncertainty into an already tumultuous presidential campaign, while President Joe Biden implored Americans to 'cool it down' in the final stretch and 'resolve our differences at the ballot box.' A former U.S. Secret Service agent says those involved in Donald Trump's security detail will have some questions to answer following an assassination attempt. A defiant Donald Trump, having just survived an attempted assassination, enters the Republican National Convention having not yet announced his vice presidential pick \u2014 but he said he'd make that choice Monday. The Republican party kicks off its convention to pick its presidential nominee in Milwaukee, Wis., on Monday, just two days after former U.S. president Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania.

View a list of all expanded essays \"Seventh Heaven\" (also referred to as \"7th Heaven\"), directed by Frank Borzage and based on the play by Austin Strong, tells the story of Chico (Charles Farrell), the Parisian sewer worker-turned-street cleaner, and his wife Diane (Janet Gaynor), who are separated during World War I, yet whose love manages to keep them connected. \"Seventh Heaven\" was initially released as a silent film but proved so popular with audiences that it was re-released with a synchronized soundtrack later that same year. The popularity of the film resulted in it becoming one of the most commercially successful silent films as well as one of the first films to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award. Janet Gaynor, Frank Borzage, and Benjamin Glazer won Oscars for their work on the film, specifically awards for Best Actress, Best Directing (Dramatic Picture), and Best Writing (Adaptation), respectively. \"Seventh Heaven\" also marked the first time often-paired stars Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell worked together. Added to the National Film Registry in 1995. Expanded essay by Aubrey Solomon (PDF, 694KB) Special-effects master Ray Harryhausen provides the hero (Kerwin Mathews) with a villanous magician (Torin Thatcher) and fantastic antagonists, including a genie, giant cyclops, fire-breathing dragons, and a sword-wielding animated skeleton, all in glorious Technicolor. And of course no mythological tale would be complete without the rescue of a damsel in distress, here a princess (Kathryn Grant) that the evil magician shrinks down to a mere few inches. Harryhausen's stunning Dynamation process, which blended stop-motion animation and live-actions sequences, and a thrilling score by Bernard Herrmann (\"Psycho,\" \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\") makes this one of the finest fantasy films of all time. Added to the National Film Registry in 2008. Expanded essay by Tony Dalton (PDF, 900KB) Considered to be one of the best westerns of the 1950s, \"3:10 to Yuma\" has gained in stature since its original release as audiences have recognized the progressive insight the film provides into the psychology of its two main characters that becomes vividly exposed during scenes of heightened tension. Frankie Laine sang the film's popular theme song, also titled \"3:10 to Yuma.\" Often compared favorably with \"High Noon,\" this innovative western from director Delmer Daves starred Glenn Ford and Van Heflin in roles cast against type and was based on a short story by Elmore Leonard. Added to the National Film Registry in 2012. In the 1950s, several television dramas acted live over the airways won such critical acclaim that they were also produced as motion pictures; among those already honored by the National Film Registry is \"Marty\" (1955). Reginald Rose had adapted his original stage play \"12 Angry Men\" for Studio One in 1954, and Henry Fonda decided to produce a screen version, taking the lead role and hiring director Sidney Lumet, who had been directing for television since 1950. The result is a classic. Filmed in a spare, claustrophobic style\u2014largely set in one jury room\u2014the play relates a single juror's refusal to conform to peer pressure in a murder trial and follows his conversion of one juror after another to his point of view. The story is often viewed as a commentary on McCarthyism, Fascism, or Communism. Added to the National Film Registry in 2007. Expanded essay by Joanna E. Rapf (PDF, 258KB) This biographical drama directed by Sir Steve McQueen, and produced by Brad Pitt\u2019s production company, is based on the 1853 slave memoir \u201cTwelve Years a Slave\u201d by Solomon Northup, an African-American free man who was kidnapped in Washington, D.C. by two conmen in 1841, and sold into slavery. He was put to work on plantations in the state of Louisiana for 12 years before being released. The film received nine Academy Award nominations, winning for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay for John Ridley, and Best Supporting Actress for Lupita Nyong\u2019o. Added to the National Film Registry in 2023. James Benning's feature-length film can be seen as a series of moving landscape paintings with artistry and scope that might be compared to Claude Monet's series of water-lily paintings. Embracing the concept of \"landscape as a function of time,\" Benning shot his film at 13 different American lakes in identical 10-minute takes. Each is a static composition: a balance of sky and water in each frame with only the very briefest suggestion of human existence. At each lake, Benning prepared a single shot, selected a single camera position and a specific moment. The climate, the weather and the season deliver a level of variation to the film, a unique play of light, despite its singularity of composition. Curators of the Rotterdam Film Festival noted, \"The power of the film is that the filmmaker teaches the viewer to look better and learn to distinguish the great varieties in the landscape alongside him. [The list of lakes] alone is enough to encompass a treatise on America and its history. A treatise the film certainly encourages, but emphatically does not take part in.\" Benning, who studied mathematics and then film at the University of Wisconsin, currently is on the faculty at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts).
