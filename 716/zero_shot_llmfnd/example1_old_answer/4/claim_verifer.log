Here are the reasons supporting this conclusion:\n\n1. Misleading Videos: The video in question, showing a beach party in Kyiv, is a mix-up and lacks clear geographical identifiers [Video_information]. It includes clips and photos of boys and girls, drinks, and beach umbrellas under sunny weather, making it hard to pinpoint the exact location of the party [Video_description_from_descriptor].\n\n2. Existing Nightlife: Reports show that nightlife in Kyiv, including parties and nightclub activities, has been ongoing despite the war situation [Query 1_evidence_3] [Query 2_evidence_1]. This indicates that social events are still taking place within the city, and the occurrence of a beach party does not prove the war to be a hoax.\n\n3. Inconsistent Claims: There have been multiple instances of misleading information and false claims regarding events in Ukraine, such as the debunked allegations of extravagant spending by Ukrainian officials, which show a pattern of misinformation [Query 2_evidence_3].\n\nConsidering the inconclusive geographical details in the viral video and the continued social activities in Kyiv during the conflict, it is not possible to definitively identify the location of the beach party shown in the video to support the claim that the war in Ukraine is a hoax.', 'Confidence': '95%'}}

Learn More July 03, 2024 | 4 min read July 03, 2024 | 4 min read From his OSINTUp session “How to analyze a video,” Josemonkey shares his top advice and provides insight into the geolocation techniques that helped him amass millions of followers. Geolocation is a crucial research skill that combines observation, analytical thinking and sometimes a bit of coding. In the OSINTUp session titled “How to analyze a video,” geolocation expert and popular TikTok content creator Josemonkey shared his enlightening and practical insights on geolocating videos from the web. Here are eight essential tips from his talk to help you improve your geolocation abilities for anyone looking to hone their skills in this crucial area of OSINT: When first analyzing an image or video, resist the urge to jump straight to conclusions. Instead, Josemonkey recommends observing all elements and writing down every detail, no matter how insignificant it seems. When looking at the media for the first time, any of the following details can provide significant context to the image, including signs, text, landmarks, distinctive colors, types of vehicles, architecture and natural features. This critical comprehensive observation phase lays the foundation for subsequent steps, so be sure to note minor details that can become crucial later. After making a list of all the observed details, Joemonkey categorizes them into two categories: By distinguishing between these, your initial search becomes more focused and effective. It will help narrow down a general location, and the exact location can be confirmed accurately later on through details. Many images and videos appear mirrored from their original form, especially those taken in selfie mode. This can lead to misinterpretations, such as reversing landmarks or reading text backward. Deciding if the image or video needs to be flipped horizontally can correct this, allowing it to appear as it does in real life. Josemonkey highlights that sometimes, determining whether a video is reversed is not straightforward, but it is necessary to use tools like reverse search effectively. Reversed text or logos are telltale signs that can help determine if the video needs to be flipped. The position of the sun and the direction of shadows in an image or video can provide valuable information about the time of day and the cardinal direction, significantly if the sun is rising or setting. Because the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, the camera\'s orientation can be determined by the sun’s location in a video or image. In higher latitudes, the angle of the shadows can also indicate the time of year. Josemonkey recommends using these natural indicators to narrow down potential locations. The tool SunCalc can also help determine a location based on the sun’s position in a video. Watch an example of how Josemonkey uses the sun position: While intuition can guide you, verifying these gut feelings with concrete evidence is essential. Josemonkey explains that even experienced geolocators can go astray if they follow intuition mindlessly. Misinterpretations can easily lead investigators down rabbit holes, so it’s critical to back up intuitive guesses with solid data. Cross-check your initial assumptions with verifiable details in the video or photo to avoid heading down the wrong path. In addition, it is essential to verify any details from an image or video with accurate data. Referencing several different sources can help significantly verify details and decrease the chance of going down a rabbit hole, getting stuck or incorrectly identifying a location. Here are a few tips for verification: Phone screens are limited when analyzing photos and videos, especially when viewing content on social media. Downloading a higher-quality video or image to view on a larger monitor allows you to zoom in on finer details that might be missed on a smaller screen. High-resolution images can reveal critical clues such as distant signs, small text or subtle differences in terrain. Josemonkey points out that viewing content on a larger scale can drastically improve the detail and accuracy of your observations. He also recommends using video and photo editing tools to manipulate aspects like contrast to make less noticeable details more prominent. If the image or video requires more time and attention to geolocate, view the content from all orientations and viewpoints to ensure you don’t miss any critical details. OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a valuable resource for geolocation, helping narrow down locations within a specific region or area. Josemonkey uses a query language called Overpass to mine data from OSM. This allows him to search for features within a certain radius, such as finding all CVS stores near a specific water tower. It is important to note that a complete reliance on tools when geolocating is ineffective as sometimes databases can be outdated with inaccurate data. However, tools like Overpass can significantly enhance your ability to narrow search areas based on specific criteria. Check out this video where Josemonkey uses Overpass: Contextual clues such as accents, clothing styles, vegetation and weather conditions can provide valuable insights into geographical regions. For instance, specific plant species, distinctive road markings, unique phone number formats and particular architectural styles can help identify specific areas. Accents and languages spoken in a video can also further narrow down the region or country. Combining these contextual elements with visual clues significantly enhances your geolocation accuracy. Understanding and integrating these subtle details into your analysis sharpens your ability to pinpoint locations and enriches your knowledge of the diverse characteristics that define different parts of the world. Geolocation is rich with endless learning opportunities. Josemonkey fondly refers to these unintended learning experiences as "side quests" that arise while researching. Embrace these moments rather than dismissing them. While staying focused on the primary mission of finding the location is crucial, don\'t hesitate to explore. These side quests often lead to discovering the location and broadening your knowledge about the world—a true win-win! Josemonkey’s session on analyzing videos ...

It serves as a guide to replicating the methodology as well as a tutorial for using open source methods, tools and crowdsourced material on Twitter to verify Russia’s claims in the war in Ukraine. by Tom Jarvis and Robin Taylor Introduction On March 4th, 2022, the Russian Ministry of Defense (MOD) published an edited YouTube video of a drone strike hitting a building supposedly somewhere in Donetsk Oblast, in Eastern Ukraine. Russian authorities claimed to have hit a command and observation post of the Aidar (Айдар) battalion, a volunteer-based military unit accused by Amnesty International of war crimes in 2014. This is believed to be the first drone strike video video published by the Russian military since the beginning of the invasion and possibly the first combat footage of the Orion UAV, also called ‘Inokhodets’ (Иноходец). Since the strike had only been reported by Russian media outlets and was (to our knowledge) not successfully verified, we decided to give it a go. Geolocating drone strikes poses several challenges. Firstly, the footage is often grainy/unclear and monochromatic, making identifying helpful map features (such as mountains, vegetation, etc.) difficult – unless you are used to working with drones. Secondly, there is usually little additional information accompanying the footage, such as the precise time and strike location. Moreover, whatever information is published about the strike may be misleading. Usually, drone footage is published by the military, and thus with a purpose. In this case, a drone strike against a known far-right militia outpost in Donetsk Oblast is an easy PR win for the Russian Ministry of Defense (MOD). Additionally, it has been well reported that Russia realised it was already losing the information war. It is therefore important to be cautious with analysing official information, seeing that they could lead the geolocation/verification effort astray. For all we know, it could be imagery from a training exercise or completely fake. We have seen several examples of old drone footage doing the rounds on social media in the last month alone. Thus, determining if this is new footage is one of the primary goals of the verification process. This guide discusses the steps, methodology and tools we used in order to geolocate and chronolocate this video, including all the challenges we encountered with its verification. Furthermore, it provides additional tips that could be used to support future drone verification attempts. Breakdown of the video The 38-second video consists of either four or five clips of footage. An initial wing-camera view of the alleged drone in flight is followed by a thermal image view of a road and compound showing the heat signatures of people. This is followed by a three-second clip – believed to have been sped up – of a car entering the target location and then the fourth clip showing the strike itself from a different angle. The fifth clip may be part of the fourth clip, where a cut to a different zoom level was recorded and shows the camera tracking off-target and looking at a nearby building. What is notable about the strike itself is the angle of the projectile as it strikes the target. Toward the end of this article, we make a case that it appears that the munition was not fired by the drone filming this footage, despite the Russian MODs claim, and could quite possibly not even be a drone strike. This would mean the drone was acting in a reconnaissance or guidance role instead. Screen capture from the video posted by the Russian Ministry of Defense on YouTube on March 4th, 2022: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK4DBQOxfZo Methodology This verification effort followed a very simple methodology. It should be noted that there could be a plethora of ways in which this footage could have been verified and there is no one-size-fits-all method. Feel free to share any alternative methods you think could have aided our search or anything we missed. Each step should help narrow down your eventual area of search. Context Context is the information that accompanies the footage you are trying to geolocate. Context can be the title or description of the video, comments online below the post itself, or it can be stored within the video in the form of EXIF/metadata. Metadata, however, is rather rare since most social media platforms strip any stored data before publishing the video on their site. In addition, metadata can be misleading since anyone can alter the metadata on purpose, or accidentally, by editing the video before publishing. From the context, you can establish the basic facts: is this a new video? What is it about? Who might be the source? Where do they claim the event took place? Furthermore, given our scepticism of the validity of the Russian MOD’s statement, we found it particularly useful to conduct further basic research regarding each fact. That meant we actively sought out and collected information and footage about the drone itself and the recent history of the Aidar battalion. This part spills over into our next phase. The search The next step is to see what others are saying about the video. ‘Others’, in this case, can be news outlets or social media comments about the strike, but also any discussion related to key terms established from the given context. In this case: ‘drones’, ‘Inokhodets’ (Orion), or ‘aidar’. The aim of this search is to gather as much additional information about the video as possible that could aid your investigation. In any geolocation case, there are bound to be others with more situated knowledge than yourself. Therefore, searching through comments or online discussions you can find about the video can provide hints or in some cases the exact location. In our case, we are also looking to find any information about the validity of ...

In the case of photos and videos this means identifying where in the world they were taken. Understanding location coordinates The latitude and longitude (also known as lat-long) coordinates system divides the earth into a grid of horizontal and vertical lines and is used to accurately pinpoint any location. Latitude measures how far a place is north or south of the equator. The equator is 0^o^ latitude, with the north pole at 90^o^ N and the south pole at 90^o^ south. Longitude measures how far a place is east or west of the prime meridian, which is at 0^o^ longitude. 180^o^ east and 180^o^ west would represent the same point, on the opposite side of the globe from the prime meridian. Latitude and longitude coordinates can be written in a number of formats: Degrees / minutes: 52°31.86797’ N, 013°24.03009’ W Degrees / minutes / seconds: 52°31’52.0784” N, 013°24’01.8054” W Decimal: 52.5311329 lat, -13.4005015 long. North of equator is positive (plus is usually not marked), south negative (marked with a “-”). East of the prime meridian is positive, west is negative. Example of latitude and longitude of a place in Google Maps. Read more about using / creating maps to find locations or to visualise data in the ETI Kit Guide “Using Maps to See Beyond the Obvious”, by Alison Killing There are several ways to do this. This guide will focus on the event in which we need to geolocate images by the elements visible in the picture, making use of available mapping services and tools. Geolocation has become a major part of journalistic investigations or open source intelligence (OSINT) inquiries as it can answer the questions of where and when an event / incident took place. Confirming the place as well as the time of an incident recorded in a video is often key in providing evidence that an event happened or did not happen as claimed. Geolocation makes it possible to draw maps of a military conflict and to see the progress of forces on the ground. Criminals can also be pursued by tracking the spatial line of their movements, as well as tracking transfers of products and equipment between countries. The answer to the question “where” is a major pillar of completing an investigation. In what follows, we will look at how free online maps can be used to accurately locate online media. But first, let’s get to know the major free map service providers. The use of maps has become a major part of our daily lives. We use them to find our way to a destination, to know more about a new place we want to visit, or to add new images and details to existing maps. But we can also use them in reverse: to identify locations and verify details of photos and videos that other people make and share. Mapping the world is a large, powerful and constantly growing industry. Specialized companies launch satellites to take multiple pictures of the globe. Each company differs from the other in the quality and detail of the image as well as the rotation rate of their satellites around the Earth to take another image of the same place. This competition provides us with multiple, high-resolution images of most of the globe. There are also limitations to this process as various laws and censorship activities limit the availability of or access to high-resolution images in some regions of the world. Reasons vary from security restrictions (e.g. around army locations in war zones), government censorship and lack of transparency (e.g. in occupied or contested territories) to state or non-state interventions to blur details of strategic or at-risk locations (e.g. military, economic locations / events, natural reserves with endangered species), etc. The most notable free map services are: OSM is an open-source mapping project that has a large community of volunteer contributors and is the basis of many other mapping projects around the world. OSM is a non-profit entity sponsored by various universities and organizations. OSM does not track its users’ activity. OSM allows and encourages their users to download its mapping databases, whereas commercial maps tend to limit data sharing through API funnels. OSM was made to be shared and built upon, so the core functionalities are intentionally basic. Google Maps - works on computes as well as mobile devices (smartphone, tablet). Google Earth - is an upgraded version of Google Maps that enables users to draw their own projects on maps: placing specific location markers and drawing illustrations on a map. This service is available on computers as well as with applications on And##roid, iPhone and iPad devices under the name Google Earth. Google Earth Pro - provides all available historical copies for free for the same geographical location. The application can be downloaded on computers only, and there is no version for mobile phones. Free resource available at Satellites.pro, it aggregates many mapping service providers.

The title of his presentation was, “Crowd Sleuths: Solving Mysteries with Crowdsourcing, Experts and AI.” The abstract was as follows: Professional investigators in fields such as journalism, law enforcement, and academia have long sought the public’s help in solving mysteries, typically by providing tips. However, as social technologies capture more digital traces of daily life and enable new forms of collaboration, members of the public are increasingly leading their own investigations. These efforts are perhaps best known for high-profile failures characterized by sloppy research and vigilantism, such as the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing manhunt on Reddit and 4chan. However, other crowdsourced investigations have led to the successful recovery of missing persons and apprehension of violent criminals, suggesting real potential. I will present three projects from my research group, the Crowd Intelligence Lab, where we helped to enable novice crowds to discover a hidden terrorist plot within large quantities of textual evidence documents; collaborate with expert investigators to geolocate and verify (or debunk) photos and videos shared on social media; and use AI-based face recognition to identify unknown soldiers in historical portraits from the American Civil War era. Dr. Luther gave an invited presentation at the AAAI Fall Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Work on November 8, 2019. The title of his presentation was, “Solving AI’s last-mile problem with crowds and experts.” Dr. Luther’s position paper accompanying the presentation is available online. The abstract for the paper is as follows: Visual search tasks, such as identifying an unknown person or location in a photo, are a crucial element of many forms of investigative work, from academic research, to journalism, to law enforcement. While AI techniques like computer vision can often quickly and accurately narrow down a large search space of thousands of possibilities to a shortlist of promising candidates, they usually cannot select the correct match(es) among those, a challenge known as the last-mile problem. We have developed an approach called crowd-augmented expert work to leverage the complementary strengths of human intelligence to solve the last-mile problem. We report on case studies developing and deploying two visual search tools, GroundTruth and Photo Sleuth, to illustrate this approach. Dr. Luther gave an invited presentation to an audience of engineers and journalists at The Washington Post on October 23, 2019. The title of his talk was, “Photo sleuthing: Helping investigators solve photo mysteries using crowdsourcing and AI.” The abstract for the talk was: Journalists, intelligence analysts, and human rights investigators frequently analyze photographs of questionable or unknown provenance, trying to identify the people and places depicted. These photos can provide invaluable leads and evidence, but even experts must invest significant time in each analysis, with no guarantee of success. Collective human intelligence (via crowdsourcing) and artificial intelligence (via computer vision) offer great potential to support expert photo analysis. However, we must first understand how to leverage the complementary strengths of these techniques to support investigators’ real-world needs and work practices. In this talk, I present my lab’s research with two “photo sleuthing” communities: (1) open-source intelligence (OSINT) analysts who geolocate and verify photos and videos shared on social media, and (2) researchers and collectors who identify unknown soldiers in historical portraits from the 19th century. Informed by qualitative studies of current practice, we developed a novel approach that combines the complementary strengths of expert investigators, novice crowdsourcing, and computer vision to solve photo mysteries. We built two software tools based on this approach, GroundTruth and Photo Sleuth, and evaluated them with real expert investigators. The Crowd Lab had two posters/demos accepted for AAAI HCOMP 2019! Both of these papers involved substantial contributions from our summer REU interns, who will be attending the conference at Skamania Lodge, Washington, to present their work. It’s QuizTime: A study of online verification practices on Twitter was led by Crowd Lab Ph.D. student Sukrit Venkatagiri, with co-authors Jacob Thebault-Spieker, Sarwat Kazmi, and Efua Akonor. Sarwat and Efua were summer REU interns in the Crowd Lab from the University of Maryland and Wellesley College, respectively. The abstract for the poster is: Misinformation poses a threat to public health, safety, and democracy. Training novices to debunk visual misinformation with image verification techniques has shown promise, yet little is known about how novices do so in the wild, and what methods prove effective. Thus, we studied 225 verification challenges posted by experts on Twitter over one year with the aim of improving novices’ skills. We collected, annotated, and analyzed these challenges and over 3,100 replies by 304 unique participants. We find that novices employ multiple tools and approaches, and techniques like collaboration and reverse image search significantly improve performance. PairWise: Mitigating political bias in crowdsourced content moderation was led by Crowd Lab postdoc Jacob Thebault-Spieker, with co-authors Sukrit Venkatagiri, David Mitchell, and Chris Hurt. David was a summer REU intern from the University of Illinois, and Chris was a Virginia Tech undergraduate. The abstract for the demo is: Crowdsourced labeling of political social media content is an area of increasing interest, due to the contextual nature of political content. However, there are substantial risks of human biases causing data to be labelled incorrectly, possibly advantaging certain political groups over others. Inspired by the social computing theory of social translucence and findings from social psychology, we built PairWise, a system designed to facilitate interpersonal accountability and help mitigate biases in political content labelling. The Crowd Lab had two papers accepted for the upcoming ACM Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW 2019) conference in Austin, TX, USA, November 9-13, 2019. The conference had a 31% acceptance rate. Ph.D. student Sukrit Venkatagiri will be presenting “GroundTruth: Augmenting expert image geolocation with crowdsourcing and shared representations,” co-authored with Jacob Thebault-Spieker, Rachel Kohler, John Purviance, Rifat Sabbir Mansur, and Kurt Luther, all from Virginia Tech.

This is the principal reason the Syrian Archive and other documentation groups depend on verified user-generated content to assist in criminal case-building as well as human rights research. The Syrian Archive strives for transparency in its tools, findings, and methodologies; as well as making sure that verified content is publicly available and accessible for journalists, human rights defenders, and lawyers working for the purpose of reporting, advocacy, and accountability purposes. To achieve transparency, software developed by the Syrian Archive is released in free and open-source formats. This is done to ensure trust is built and maintained with our partners and collaborators, as well as allowing software to be reused and customised by other groups outside of the Syrian Archive. Technical integration with existing open-source investigative tools ensures that work is not duplicated. The Syrian Archive works alongside technologists to develop our open-source tools. Our methodology is developed in collaboration with other archival groups, as well as lawyers and journalists. The Syrian Archive’s Data and Operational Model is based on the Electronic Discovery Reference Model developed by Duke University School of Law. Below is a detailed description of every step of this model. Our collection process involved establishing a standardised metadata schema alongside a database of credible sources for digital content. Sources can be direct submissions from individuals and organisations, publicly available social media accounts and channels, as well as other publicly available information. Before any collection, archival, or verification of digital materials was possible, we had to establish a database of credible sources for visual content. We have identified over 3.500 credible sources, including individual journalists and field reporters, larger media houses (e.g. local and international news agencies), human rights organisations (e.g. Syria Institute for Justice), the Syrian Civil Defense (White Helmets), local field clinics and hospitals. Many of these sources began publishing or providing visual content in late 2011-early 2012 and also publish work in other credible media outlets. Visual content is primarily accessed through social media channels (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Websites, Telegram), submitted files (videos, photos, pdf), and external and collaborators’ data sets. Changes in these data sets are tracked, meaning that all versions are saved. Credibility is determined by analysing whether the source is familiar to us, or our existing network, as well as checking that the source’s content and reportage has been reliable in the past. This might include evaluating how long the source has been reporting and how active they are. To identify where the source is based, social media channels might be evaluated to determine if videos uploaded are consistently from a specific location, or whether locations differ significantly. Channels and accounts might be analysed to determine whether they use a logo and whether this logo is consistently used across videos. Channels and accounts might be additionally analysed for original content to determine whether the uploader aggregates videos from other news organisations or accounts, or whether the source appears to be the primary uploader. The Syrian Archive established a database of credible sources for verification. These sources provide additional information used to verify content on social media platforms or received from sources directly. Content verifiers include citizen journalists, human rights defenders and humanitarian workers based in Syria and abroad. To preserve data integrity, sources used for content acquisition do not comprise part of the database for verification. Before we can preserve or verify any content we must define a system through which content can be managed and organised, this is done through metadata. Establishing a data ontology or metadata scheme is necessary to assist us in organising and managing content as well as helping users in identifying and understanding what happened, and when and where. Whilst recognising the need for a data ontology, or standardised metadata scheme. We also recognise that the implementation of any metadata scheme is a highly political choice. Given that there are no universally accepted, legally admissible metadata standards, efforts were made to develop a framework in consultation with a variety of international investigative bodies. These include consultations with members of the United Nations Office for High Commissioner of Human Rights, the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism on international crimes committed in Syria (IIIM), and with other archival institutes, and human rights and research organisations. Adding metadata happens after content is preserved but it is crucial to define a metadata scheme before collecting and processing content. The Syrian Archive’s collection and secure preservation workflow ensures that original content is not lost due to its removal from corporate platforms. This is achieved by collecting and securely storing digital content on external backend servers before it is taken offline and prior to basic verification procedures. Content is then backed up securely on servers throughout the world. We use our in-house software, Diwan, that is developed for human rights investigations using online user-generated content. Diwan is a tool designed to support journalists, non-profits, academic researchers, human rights organisations and others with investigations using online, publicly-available sources (e.g.tweets, videos, public databases, websites, online databases). In this preservation pipeline we detect the spoken language, and standardise the data format (whilst preserving the old format). We screenshot and download the web page hosting the content. Files that are in our database get both their md5 and sha256 hash and are time-stamped with Enigio Time - a third party collaborator. We hash and timestamp in order to ensure and prove data integrity which means that data has not been changed or manipulated since it has been archived. Once content has been safely preserved metadata is extracted from visual content, its parsed and aggregated automatically using our predefined and standardised metadata schema. Location and source details might be included in the parsed metadata which can be useful to geolocate where ...

Most of these images date from before the war, however, and some of the establishments where they were filmed have been closed since the conflict began in February 2022. Issued on: 12/05/2023 - 14:09 If you only have a minute Several posts, including one with a video viewed more than 8 million times, claim to show current scenes of the nightlife in Kyiv, apparently showing that the population of Ukraine is using donations from the West to throw these parties despite the war. The footage in the video, however, comes from scenes filmed in 2021, or in establishments that have been closed since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. Nightlife has indeed resumed in Kyiv over the past few months after the curfew in the city was extended to midnight in March. However, the venues shown in these videos say they have not received any donations, instead organising parties to donate their profits to the Ukrainian army. The fact-check, in detail"Meanwhile in Kyiv nightclubs … Please donate more money!" says the Twitter account @RadioGenova, which often shares pro-Russian disinformation, above a video compilation showing Ukrainians partying in nightclubs."So they\'ve gotten donations so that they can go to the club," says another user (in French) who shared the video, video 8.6 million times since it was published on May 3. Others had similar reactions, arguing that foreign aid shouldn\'t be used to fund parties in Ukraine. RadioGenova post with 8.6 million views as of May 10, 2023. Click on the image to see the archived publication. © Twitter / RadioGenova Clues show us two clips are from 2021The video is a compilation of four different clips that were taken from the TikTok account @kievnight, which shared videos of parties at bars and nightclubs across the Ukrainian capital.The first 27 seconds of the video, for example, were filmed at a bar and nightclub called the Fifty Club. We found the location using the full video published on December 23, 2022 on TikTok. The poster claims in a comment that the video was filmed in 2021. Above: the date that the original video was posted on TikTok. Below: a comment from @kievnight claiming that the video was taken in 2021. © TikTok / kievnight To verify these claims, the FRANCE 24 Observers team took a closer look at the Fifty Club\'s posts on social media. The same scene was filmed and posted the evening of November 19, 2021. Videos show the same man with a microphone wearing a pink t-shirt – the Ukrainian artist Dred, who was performing that day. The same yellow decorations are also visible on the wall. On the left, the video that appeared in the "RadioGenova" post claiming to show a recent party in Kyiv. On the right, a screenshot of the same party from November 19, 2021 published in the Instagram stories of the Fifty Club, where you can recognize the same man on the microphone, the Ukrainian artist Dred. © Observers The same goes for the clip visible at the end of the video compilation, between 1:22 and 1:33. We see people dancing in a bar and a television screen that says "Boho".This video was published on December 4, 2021 by the @kievnight TikTok account, two and a half months before the beginning of the Russian invasion in Ukraine. This scene was filmed in the bar and restaurant "Boho", which appears on the screen in this image, and was published on December 4, 2021. © TikTok / @kievnight The FRANCE 24 Observers team reached out to the restaurant, which claims that the video is even older than that, explaining that much of the decor visible in the video has been replaced over the past three years. They provided us with photos to support this, including one that shows a fridge behind the young woman dancing in the middle of the image above. Photo of the Boho restaurant and karaoke bar provided to the FRANCE 24 Observers team by the venue\'s marketing team on May 8, 2023. The small refrigerator in front of the television screen is not the same as that of the 2021 video. The restaurant told us it changed these refrigerators at least three years ago. © Boho Karaoké Safari Videos from establishments that have been closed for monthsSo what about the last two clips in the video, appearing between 0:27 and 1:22? These two videos can also be found on the @kievnight TikTok account, with the hashtag #TBT, or Throwback Thursday, used to share old posts. The #TBT in this post refers to "Throwback Thursday", used on social networks to post old videos or photos of fond memories. © TikTok / kievnight The TikTok account did not respond to our request for comment about these two clips. Howver, we were able to find out where these videos were filmed. The first one (appearing from 0:27-0:57) shows a bar called Sparks, which has a recognisable red ceiling as seen in several videos on its social media. We also noticed the same speaker hanging on the wall (in blue below).However, Sparks has been inactive on social media since January 2022. While we were unable to reach the establishment, others that we spoke to for this article told us that it has been closed since the start of the war. On the left, video posted by @RadioGenova showing a grid ceiling with red lights as well as a speaker outlined in blue. On the right, screenshot of an Instagram post by Sparks, which features the same ceiling and speaker. © Instagram / SparksClub The final clip (from 0:57 to 1:22) was filmed at Hangover, as indicated by outdoor furniture visible in photos online. The establishment is seasonal, open only between June and August each year. It closed its door ...

Valery Zaluzhny, over whether the war has reached a World War I-style “stalemate” — as Zaluzhny asserted in a recent interview with the Economist. Zelensky then rebuffed those remarks at a news conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “Everyone is tired and there are different opinions,” Zelensky said when discussing Zaluzhny’s “stalemate” remark. He also told NBC News that he does “not think that this is a stalemate.” But one of the president’s aides went so far as to say on Ukrainian TV that a comment like Zaluzhny’s to the media “eases the work” of Russia. Zaluzhny, a career military officer, enjoys huge national popularity, and he is widely viewed as a potential threat to Zelensky should he ever jump into politics. So far, the general has given no indication that he plans such a move.

Here’s how it could change the weather. Do landlords have to provide AC? Here’s what renters should know. But after 20 months of all-out war, public fissures are starting to appear in Ukraine’s previously unshakable national unity. The issue of a stalemate is especially sensitive because Ukrainian officials fear a perceived deadlock could mean they will be pressured into negotiations with Russia that would force them to cede territory. An overwhelming majority of Ukrainians oppose territorial concessions. The friction among leaders is on full display as Ukraine prepares for the possibility of another brutal winter with virtually no hope of any significant progress on the southern front. Even Zaluzhny has said: “There will most likely be no deep and beautiful breakthrough.” These open disagreements “serve as a distraction from winning the war and definitely play into [the] enemy’s hands,” said Alyona Getmanchuk, founder and director of the New Europe Center, a think tank in Kyiv. “[E]verything starts from … unity inside Ukraine,” Getmanchuk said. The lack of good news is dampening civilian morale, as are growing fears Russia will soon renew its attacks on energy infrastructure that could make life miserable during the coldest months of the year. Grenade in birthday gift kills aide to Ukraine’s top commander The pressure is coming not only from the battlefield. International attention has largely diverted to the war in Israel and Gaza. And in Washington, there are disagreements among lawmakers over additional aid for Ukraine. On Monday, Zelensky publicly dismissed the possibility of holding a presidential election in spring, as would normally occur on Ukraine’s political calendar. Some foreign officials had urged Zelensky to press on with elections, as a show of the country’s commitment to democracy. Zelensky, however, declared that discussions of elections were “utterly irresponsible” during wartime. The country is under martial law, which prohibits holding elections. In addition to thousands of soldiers fighting on the front, millions of Ukrainians have been displaced by the war, which makes holding a fair election almost impossible. Until now, Ukraine had shown solid national unity with political rivalries set aside as the country fought back against the Russian invasion. In recent days in Kyiv, however, some observers have expressed frustration over the sense that infighting has played a role in key decisions with potentially serious effects on the outcome of the war. Last week, for example, Zelensky’s office removed Gen. Viktor Khorenko, who headed the country’s special forces. Khorenko, who served under Zaluzhny, told Ukrainian media outlet Ukrainska Pravda that he did not know the reason for his dismissal and that he “learned about it from the media.” Zaluzhny, he said, also appeared blindsided by the announcement and “could not explain this to me.” Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, whose predecessor Oleksii Reznikov was ousted by Zelensky in September amid a corruption inquiry, said in a statement posted on Facebook that he could not publicly describe the reasons for Khorenko’s dismissal because such revelations could aid Russia. In a top comment on Facebook that was liked hundreds of times, former vice prime minister Pavlo Rozenko criticized Umerov’s handling of the issue. “You made a very big mistake when you made this submission behind Zaluzhny’s back,” Rozenko wrote. “And it is precisely such mistakes that weaken Ukraine in this war! … It is very unfortunate that political intrigues prevail in this situation!” Many others chimed in to criticize the move. One speculated that Khorenko was dismissed because “it was not possible to dislodge Zaluzhny.” The political fractures have further darkened a national mood that was already somber over a series of brutal missile strikes by Russia and other military setbacks. Russian missile strikes brigade in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine says Over the weekend, at least 19 soldiers from Ukraine’s 128th Mountain Assault Brigade were killed when Russia fired a missile at a location near the front where they were gathered for a medal ceremony. The incident drew widespread outrage in Ukraine and is under investigation. The brigade commander was suspended, and Zelensky demanded an investigation into what he described as “a tragedy that could have been avoided.” Then, on Monday, a top aide to Zaluzhny was killed when ...

Turner (R-Ohio), who chairs the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said Sunday that it was “absolutely true” that some Republican members of Congress were repeating Russian propaganda about the invasion of Ukraine instigated by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nTurner did not specify which members he was referring to, but he said he agreed with House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Michael McCaul (R-Tex.),  who said in an interview with Puck News last week that Russian propaganda had “infected a good chunk of my party’s base” and suggested that conservative media was to blame.\nWhen asked on Sunday, Turner said he agreed with McCaul’s sentiments.\n“We see directly coming from Russia attempts to mask communications that are anti-Ukraine and pro-Russia messages — some of which we even hear being uttered on the House floor,” Turner said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”\nThe pro-Russia messaging, Turner said, has made it harder for Ukraine’s supporters in the GOP to frame the conflict as “an authoritarian-versus-democracy battle.” “Ukraine needs our help and assistance now, and this is a very critical time for the U.S. Congress to step up and provide that aid,” Turner added.\nBillions of dollars in badly needed military funding for Ukraine has stalled in Congress for months, amid growing opposition from Republicans, and particular vehemence from the GOP’s right flank. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who has proposed forging a “peace treaty with Russia” in lieu of supporting Ukraine, has vowed to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) should he move forward with a vote on an aid package.\nWhen Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in December traveled to Washington to try to secure a breakthrough for additional U.S. military aid, Greene said she was opposed.\nGreene wrote on X, “Why doesn’t anyone in Washington talk about a peace treaty with Russia?? A deal with Putin promising he will not continue any further invasions. Answer: Washington wants war, not peace.”\nU.S. allies and NATO members are also growing increasingly worried about future Russian aggression. The Washington Post reported this weekend that if Donald Trump wins the November election, he is proposing to push Ukraine to cede wide swaths of its territory to Russia, thus expanding the reach of Putin’s dictatorship.\nStill, some lawmakers are more optimistic about getting some type of deal passed. Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.), an outspoken Republican supporter of Ukraine aid, told CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday that he believed Johnson will prioritize passing supplemental security assistance for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan after Congress returns on Tuesday from a two-week recess.\n“I believe he’s fully committed to bringing it up to the floor immediately” after addressing the reauthorization of a contentious national security surveillance program when Congress returns to work, Hill said.\nThe Senate earlier this year approved a $95.3 billion funding package. Many senators have echoed the White House’s warnings that without a fresh infusion of weapons from the United States, Ukraine risks ceding its war to Russia.\nBut Johnson, amid fierce opposition from his far-right flank, has so far refused to bring the Senate package to a vote on the House floor.\nHill, who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, hinted Sunday that Johnson would probably introduce a version of the supplemental national security package that includes an additional provision to redirect certain frozen Russian assets toward paying for Ukraine’s reconstruction.\nHowever, any changes to the legislation in the House would necessitate significant further delays to the provision of aid, by forcing the chambers to reconcile and approve the differences. But Hill said he believed there is widespread bipartisan support for the new provision, known as the REPO Act.\nThe latest: The Ukrainian military has launched a long-anticipated counteroffensive against occupying Russian forces, opening a crucial phase in the war aimed at restoring Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty and preserving Western support in its fight against Moscow.\nThe fight: Ukrainian troops have  intensified their attacks on the front line in the southeast region, according to multiple individuals in the country’s armed forces, in a significant push toward Russian-occupied territory.\nThe front line: The Washington Post has mapped out the 600-mile front line between Ukrainian and Russian forces.\nHow you can help: Here are ways those in the United States can support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.\nRead our full coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war.

Burkina Faso Israel/Palestine Lebanon Sudan Venezuela None South China Sea Democratic Republic of Congo Sudan Kenya Israel/Palestine Burkina Faso None Burkina Faso Our monthly conflict tracker highlights five conflict risks in July. CrisisWatch identified six deteriorations in June. Notably: Aside from the scores of conflict situations we regularly assess, we tracked significant developments in: Bolivia, Cuba, Gabon, Honduras, Madagascar, Moldova, New Caledonia and South Africa. What happened in June? In what could amount to the deadliest attack on the army since anti-jihadist operations began in 2015, the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (JNIM) reportedly killed on 11 June over 100 soldiers in an attack on a military base in Mansila town, Yagha province, Sahel region. The following day, artillery fire hit state television headquarters near the presidential residence in the capital Ouagadougou. Although President Ibrahim Traoré said a soldier had accidentally mishandled a weapon, unconfirmed rumours swirled that the Mansila attack had provoked an army mutiny. Attacks by security forces and jihadists causing mass civilian casualties continued. Why does it matter? The 11 June attack and rumours of growing discontent within the armed forces serve as a stark reminder of Traoré’s inability to halt jihadist violence and stop Burkina Faso’s downward spiral. While the military government publicly insists that it is restoring security, the massacre at Mansila, as with other deadly attacks against the army in the weeks before, illustrates that it has thus far been unable to do so. The attack has exposed and fuelled divisions within the military, leading to speculation of threats to the regime’s grip on power. Caught between jihadists and security forces, civilians are meanwhile paying a heavy price. What to watch in the coming weeks and months? The government’s security failures could threaten its survival. Long-standing divisions within the military are likely to become more prominent, and reports of budget shortages could mean that parts of the security forces are not being paid. President Traoré may increasingly rely on outside support from Africa Corps and Sahelian allies, especially Mali and Niger, to stay in power. Still, if the security situation continues to deteriorate at its current pace, a power struggle could erupt within the military, and lead to Traoré’s ouster. A leadership vacuum could benefit jihadist groups and worsen an already catastrophic humanitarian crisis. As they struggle to get a grip on security, the authorities are likely to continue their heavy-handed crackdown on dissent. They have banned almost all foreign broadcasters and blocked their websites for reporting on human rights groups’ allegations that the security forces are responsible for slaughtering civilians. Some local media have also been banned. Critics of the military regime have been forcibly conscripted or disappeared. Repression will likely increase as the junta tries to bury reports of jihadist attacks on soldiers like the Mansila massacre. The recent extension of a general mobilisation decree means the government will continue to rely on forced conscription to suppress any critical voices. Meantime, villagers across the country – especially in the Est, Centre-Est, Sahel, Centre-Nord, Nord, Boucle du Mouhoun regions – find themselves trapped between jihadist groups and security forces, both of which often use indiscriminate violence. Widespread displacement – with at least two million currently on the move – is unlikely to end soon as civilians fear returning to areas recently recaptured by the government for fear of persistent insecurity and as jihadists maintain a blockade on dozens of towns. What should be done? Recognising that it will need popular support to defeat the jihadists, the government should place a much higher emphasis on protecting communities and curbing abuse within its ranks. Western partners should continue to engage with the military regime in Ouagadougou in non-security sectors, particularly promoting social cohesion and community dialogue as part of an effort to convince the authorities of the utility of non-military solutions to insecurity. To ensure that massacres of civilians are not forgotten or silenced by state-controlled media, Western partners should also make public statements whenever large-scale massacres are committed by one of the parties to the conflict. Western partners should also continue to help humanitarian actors and relevant ministries provide humanitarian assistance to populations in need, notably internally displaced people, that are an estimated 10 per cent of a total population of 22 million. Detention of Nigerien nationals ratcheted up bilateral tensions; threat of jihadist spillover from neighbouring countries remained high. Diplomatic standoff with Niger continued with arrest of Nigerien oil workers. Bilateral tensions persisted as Niger refused to reopen its land border and oil exports through shared pipeline faced blockages from both govts. Authorities 5 June arrested five Nigeriens working for Chinese-Nigerien operator of pipeline (WAPCo), alleging they fraudulently attempted to access oil terminal and accusing them of spying; in response, Niamey next day blocked oil exports from their side and 8 June denounced “kidnapping” of workers (see Niger). Govt 13 June released two of those detained but 17 June convicted other three, including WAPCo deputy director general, of falsifying data, giving them 18-month suspended sentence; relatively lenient sentence seen by many as attempt at compromise while former presidents Bony Yayi and Soglo 25 June travelled to Niger and met Nigerien President Gen. Tiani and PM Zeine in attempt to ease tensions; oil exports, however, remained on hold. Jihadist violence continued in north. Pendjari National Park and others including W Park remained vulnerable to jihadist infiltration from Burkina Faso and Niger despite ongoing deployment of troops in area. Notably, gunmen 4 June killed seven soldiers in ambush near Tanguieta town in Pendjari park in ...

Burkina Faso Israel/Palestine Lebanon Sudan Venezuela None South China Sea Democratic Republic of Congo Sudan Kenya Israel/Palestine Burkina Faso None Burkina Faso Our monthly conflict tracker highlights five conflict risks in July. CrisisWatch identified six deteriorations in June. Notably: Aside from the scores of conflict situations we regularly assess, we tracked significant developments in: Bolivia, Cuba, Gabon, Honduras, Madagascar, Moldova, New Caledonia and South Africa. What happened in June? In what could amount to the deadliest attack on the army since anti-jihadist operations began in 2015, the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (JNIM) reportedly killed on 11 June over 100 soldiers in an attack on a military base in Mansila town, Yagha province, Sahel region. The following day, artillery fire hit state television headquarters near the presidential residence in the capital Ouagadougou. Although President Ibrahim Traoré said a soldier had accidentally mishandled a weapon, unconfirmed rumours swirled that the Mansila attack had provoked an army mutiny. Attacks by security forces and jihadists causing mass civilian casualties continued. Why does it matter? The 11 June attack and rumours of growing discontent within the armed forces serve as a stark reminder of Traoré’s inability to halt jihadist violence and stop Burkina Faso’s downward spiral. While the military government publicly insists that it is restoring security, the massacre at Mansila, as with other deadly attacks against the army in the weeks before, illustrates that it has thus far been unable to do so. The attack has exposed and fuelled divisions within the military, leading to speculation of threats to the regime’s grip on power. Caught between jihadists and security forces, civilians are meanwhile paying a heavy price. What to watch in the coming weeks and months? The government’s security failures could threaten its survival. Long-standing divisions within the military are likely to become more prominent, and reports of budget shortages could mean that parts of the security forces are not being paid. President Traoré may increasingly rely on outside support from Africa Corps and Sahelian allies, especially Mali and Niger, to stay in power. Still, if the security situation continues to deteriorate at its current pace, a power struggle could erupt within the military, and lead to Traoré’s ouster. A leadership vacuum could benefit jihadist groups and worsen an already catastrophic humanitarian crisis. As they struggle to get a grip on security, the authorities are likely to continue their heavy-handed crackdown on dissent. They have banned almost all foreign broadcasters and blocked their websites for reporting on human rights groups’ allegations that the security forces are responsible for slaughtering civilians. Some local media have also been banned. Critics of the military regime have been forcibly conscripted or disappeared. Repression will likely increase as the junta tries to bury reports of jihadist attacks on soldiers like the Mansila massacre. The recent extension of a general mobilisation decree means the government will continue to rely on forced conscription to suppress any critical voices. Meantime, villagers across the country – especially in the Est, Centre-Est, Sahel, Centre-Nord, Nord, Boucle du Mouhoun regions – find themselves trapped between jihadist groups and security forces, both of which often use indiscriminate violence. Widespread displacement – with at least two million currently on the move – is unlikely to end soon as civilians fear returning to areas recently recaptured by the government for fear of persistent insecurity and as jihadists maintain a blockade on dozens of towns. What should be done? Recognising that it will need popular support to defeat the jihadists, the government should place a much higher emphasis on protecting communities and curbing abuse within its ranks. Western partners should continue to engage with the military regime in Ouagadougou in non-security sectors, particularly promoting social cohesion and community dialogue as part of an effort to convince the authorities of the utility of non-military solutions to insecurity. To ensure that massacres of civilians are not forgotten or silenced by state-controlled media, Western partners should also make public statements whenever large-scale massacres are committed by one of the parties to the conflict. Western partners should also continue to help humanitarian actors and relevant ministries provide humanitarian assistance to populations in need, notably internally displaced people, that are an estimated 10 per cent of a total population of 22 million. Detention of Nigerien nationals ratcheted up bilateral tensions; threat of jihadist spillover from neighbouring countries remained high. Diplomatic standoff with Niger continued with arrest of Nigerien oil workers. Bilateral tensions persisted as Niger refused to reopen its land border and oil exports through shared pipeline faced blockages from both govts. Authorities 5 June arrested five Nigeriens working for Chinese-Nigerien operator of pipeline (WAPCo), alleging they fraudulently attempted to access oil terminal and accusing them of spying; in response, Niamey next day blocked oil exports from their side and 8 June denounced “kidnapping” of workers (see Niger). Govt 13 June released two of those detained but 17 June convicted other three, including WAPCo deputy director general, of falsifying data, giving them 18-month suspended sentence; relatively lenient sentence seen by many as attempt at compromise while former presidents Bony Yayi and Soglo 25 June travelled to Niger and met Nigerien President Gen. Tiani and PM Zeine in attempt to ease tensions; oil exports, however, remained on hold. Jihadist violence continued in north. Pendjari National Park and others including W Park remained vulnerable to jihadist infiltration from Burkina Faso and Niger despite ongoing deployment of troops in area.

[+] which is allowed to visit by the city authorities on August 13, 2023 in Odesa, Ukraine. In Odesa six beaches were officially opened for swimming - for the first time since the start of a full-scale war. (смысловой повтор текста). However, people also continue to swim on the other beaches of the city, where swimming is prohibited. (Photo by Viacheslav Onyshchenko/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images) A number of videos featuring bikini-clad women made the rounds on Twitter this weekend, but not for the reasons some might expect. The clips purported to show a beach on the Black Sea near the Ukrainian city of Odesa after it reportedly reopened for the first time since Russia\'s invasion. The post was met with a backlash as those critical of U.S. and other Western aid being provided to Ukraine voiced their frustration that it didn\'t resemble a warzone. However, other users on Twitter soon weighed in that the video was actually filmed at the Strandbad Plötzensee, a lake in the city of Berlin, Germany! Another video also circulated showing a party-like gathering at the Ibiza Beach Club in Odesa. It does resemble the images and videos on the club\'s official website, and it is—or at least was—a very popular hotspot, yet, it remains unclear when the video may have actually been filmed. The club\'s Facebook page hasn\'t been updated since 2018 and no videos have been posted to its YouTube page since July of 2021—more than six months before Russia launched its unprovoked invasion. It would appear that the Ibiza Beach Club in Odesa may still be closed. However, there is a grain of truth to the story. As Reuters reported on Saturday, several beaches in the city have been officially opened for swimming, but bathing in the sea is banned during air raid alerts. It is also important to note the city has been repeatedly attacked with missiles and drones, while the waters have been littered with hundreds of sea mines. In other words, people may be swimming in Ukraine, but it is hardly the party atmosphere some on social media have suggested. "This is a classic piece of disinformation. There are a few interesting things about this. First, this is what I always think of as a \'cheap fake\' instead of a \'DeepFake,\'" said Dr. Cliff Lampe, professor of information and associate dean for academic affairs in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. "The only thing they did was to add a tag to an already existing video," explained Lampe. "No AI needed, just the simplest of video techniques. We\'ve seen this several times, and these cheap fakes are very prevalent as a type of disinformation." Lampe added that whoever first posted the video was also clever in that it uses attractive people to immediately grab attention, but then also layers on sexual moral judgment onto anti-Biden or anti-war intents. "Disinformation needs to gather attention, which this effectively did, and it is more effective when it hits on multiple levels of outrage," said Lampe. "I wouldn\'t say this changed any minds. That\'s usually not the goal behind disinformation—which is more about deepening already held beliefs and calling into question the very nature of truth itself. Clearly, this was a successful effort." What was also notable with these videos is that the online sleuths quickly identified that one of the videos was filmed in Germany, while some were wrong that the other wasn\'t actually Odessa. That could make others question a fact-checker if they turn out to be wrong. It also makes us question whether we can even trust fact-checkers in general! "It depends on the post and the fact-checkers. I\'d believe Bellingcat without question because they disclose their methodology and they have a track record," suggested Dr. Matthew Schmidt, associate professor in the National Security Department at the University of New Haven. "If someone replied to this with convincing photographic evidence, which was then agreed to by the consensus of responses, I\'d be inclined to believe it," Schmidt continued. "The point is that there\'s a great wealth of talent in the open source community, so they\'ve repeatedly shown they\'re right about things." However, it could still be good to be skeptical by default. "Like a scientist saying \'I believe X with 75% confidence, but Y with 90%.\' People need to think in probabilities, then they can use open source intel intelligently," Schmidt noted. "It\'s not just right or wrong, it\'s shades of right enoughness." On the surface having open source fact-checkers could seem to be a case of "who guards the guardians"—Quis custodiet ipsos custodes. However, Schmidt dismissed that notion. "This isn\'t so much who guards the guardians—because these guys on the Internet aren\'t the guardians—but who is guarding the gate to true intelligence," Schmidt pondered. "Is it the guardians at the CIA or the crowd? Because the amount of open source Intel that drives analysis at places like the CIA would surprise people. They\'re feeding the guardians. And the really TS/SCI (Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information) stuff is the dessert, not the main meal." One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Read below to learn more about the enrollment verification requirement and verification methods.\nEnrollment verification is a requirement for Post-9/11 GI Bill students to verify that they have remained enrolled in the same courses or training each month. Students who receive MHA/kicker payments will have their payments withheld if they fail to verify or report that they are no longer enrolled in their courses or training.\xa0To streamline the process, VA is providing the options to verify enrollment easily and securely via text message, email, and online at VA.gov.\xa0\nThis requirement is only for Post-9/11 GI Bill and does not impact other benefit programs,\xa0such as the Montgomery GI Bill\xa0(MGIB), Veteran Employment Through Technology Education Courses (VET TEC), Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance (DEA), Veterans Rapid Retraining Assistance Program (VRRAP), or the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship.\xa0\xa0This requirement also does not currently apply to GI Bill students attending half-time or less or those in on-the-job, apprenticeship, flight, or correspondence training.\nIf you are an MGIB student or participate in the STEM or VET TEC programs, this new requirement does not represent a change for you, as\xa0you are already required to verify enrollment.\nStudents will need to verify at the end of each month once their courses or training starts.For example, if your term starts in August, you will need to begin verifying at the end of August.\nYou can verify enrollment via text, email, or online at VA.gov.\xa0 See more details below:If you need to verify your enrollment and are looking for instructions on how to do it, check out the How to Verify Enrollment for Post-9/11 GI Bill Students video.\nBy Text Message:\nNOTE: When responding to opt-in or verification texts, it may take up to a day to receive a confirmation text in response.\xa0 Be assured that your response has been received. Texts will be sent from 44354.\nEnrollment verification via text message is safe and secure. VA will never ask for your personal information, such as social security number or bank account information, via text.\xa0 VA strongly recommends text message verifications for verifying your renrollment.\nBy Email:\nOnline at VA.gov\nNOTE: If you are opted into text or email verification and verify on VA.gov prior to receiving the verification text or email at the end of the month, you will still receive a notfication on the last day of the month.\nBy Phone\nPhone verification is the least recommended option, but if you are unable to verify via text, email, or online, you will need to contact the Education Call Center (ECC) at 1-888-GIBILL-1 (1-888-442-4551) domestically or 001-918-781-5678 internationally and ask a representative to verify your enrollment.\nNOTE: ECC wait times may be high due to the number of students verifying enrollment each month.\nIf you fail to verify enrollment for two consecutive months, your MHA/kicker payments will be placed on hold. To have your payments released, you will need to use online verification, Ask VA or call the ECC to verify your enrollment.\nBy regularly verifying your enrollment, you protect your GI Bill entitlement by preventing charges for classes or training you did not attend. Though this requirement is an additional step, enrollment verification is easy to do and will help you better manage and access your earned benefits, as well as help prevent overpayments.\nTo learn more about how VA is protecting your information, visit our text message terms and conditions.\nTo learn more, please visit the following resources:\xa0 \xa0●\xa0\xa0Frequently Asked Questions\xa0 \xa0●\xa0 Video: How to Verify Enrollment for Post-9/11 GI Bill® Students\xa0\xa0\nVeterans Crisis Line:\n988 (Press 1)\nSocial Media\nComplete Directory \nIf you are in crisis or having thoughts of suicide,\r\n\tvisit VeteransCrisisLine.net for more resources.\nU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs | 810 Vermont Avenue, NW Washington DC 20420\nLast updated January 17, 2024', 'content_num': 879}, 'website_quality_evaluation': {'website_quality Score': 8, 'justification': "The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits website is a trusted resource for information on veterans' benefits, services, and programs.
