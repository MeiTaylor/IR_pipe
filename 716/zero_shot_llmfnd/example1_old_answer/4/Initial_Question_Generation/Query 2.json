Most of these images date from before the war, however, and some of the establishments where they were filmed have been closed since the conflict began in February 2022. Issued on: 12/05/2023 - 14:09 If you only have a minute Several posts, including one with a video viewed more than 8 million times, claim to show current scenes of the nightlife in Kyiv, apparently showing that the population of Ukraine is using donations from the West to throw these parties despite the war. The footage in the video, however, comes from scenes filmed in 2021, or in establishments that have been closed since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. Nightlife has indeed resumed in Kyiv over the past few months after the curfew in the city was extended to midnight in March. However, the venues shown in these videos say they have not received any donations, instead organising parties to donate their profits to the Ukrainian army. The fact-check, in detail\"Meanwhile in Kyiv nightclubs … Please donate more money!\" says the Twitter account @RadioGenova, which often shares pro-Russian disinformation, above a video compilation showing Ukrainians partying in nightclubs.\"So they've gotten donations so that they can go to the club,\" says another user (in French) who shared the video, video 8.6 million times since it was published on May 3. Others had similar reactions, arguing that foreign aid shouldn't be used to fund parties in Ukraine. RadioGenova post with 8.6 million views as of May 10, 2023. Click on the image to see the archived publication. © Twitter / RadioGenova Clues show us two clips are from 2021The video is a compilation of four different clips that were taken from the TikTok account @kievnight, which shared videos of parties at bars and nightclubs across the Ukrainian capital.The first 27 seconds of the video, for example, were filmed at a bar and nightclub called the Fifty Club. We found the location using the full video published on December 23, 2022 on TikTok. The poster claims in a comment that the video was filmed in 2021. Above: the date that the original video was posted on TikTok. Below: a comment from @kievnight claiming that the video was taken in 2021. © TikTok / kievnight To verify these claims, the FRANCE 24 Observers team took a closer look at the Fifty Club's posts on social media. The same scene was filmed and posted the evening of November 19, 2021. Videos show the same man with a microphone wearing a pink t-shirt – the Ukrainian artist Dred, who was performing that day. The same yellow decorations are also visible on the wall. On the left, the video that appeared in the \"RadioGenova\" post claiming to show a recent party in Kyiv. On the right, a screenshot of the same party from November 19, 2021 published in the Instagram stories of the Fifty Club, where you can recognize the same man on the microphone, the Ukrainian artist Dred. © Observers The same goes for the clip visible at the end of the video compilation, between 1:22 and 1:33. We see people dancing in a bar and a television screen that says \"Boho\".This video was published on December 4, 2021 by the @kievnight TikTok account, two and a half months before the beginning of the Russian invasion in Ukraine. This scene was filmed in the bar and restaurant \"Boho\", which appears on the screen in this image, and was published on December 4, 2021. © TikTok / @kievnight The FRANCE 24 Observers team reached out to the restaurant, which claims that the video is even older than that, explaining that much of the decor visible in the video has been replaced over the past three years. They provided us with photos to support this, including one that shows a fridge behind the young woman dancing in the middle of the image above. Photo of the Boho restaurant and karaoke bar provided to the FRANCE 24 Observers team by the venue's marketing team on May 8, 2023. The small refrigerator in front of the television screen is not the same as that of the 2021 video. The restaurant told us it changed these refrigerators at least three years ago. © Boho Karaoké Safari Videos from establishments that have been closed for monthsSo what about the last two clips in the video, appearing between 0:27 and 1:22? These two videos can also be found on the @kievnight TikTok account, with the hashtag #TBT, or Throwback Thursday, used to share old posts. The #TBT in this post refers to \"Throwback Thursday\", used on social networks to post old videos or photos of fond memories. © TikTok / kievnight The TikTok account did not respond to our request for comment about these two clips. Howver, we were able to find out where these videos were filmed. The first one (appearing from 0:27-0:57) shows a bar called Sparks, which has a recognisable red ceiling as seen in several videos on its social media. We also noticed the same speaker hanging on the wall (in blue below).However, Sparks has been inactive on social media since January 2022. While we were unable to reach the establishment, others that we spoke to for this article told us that it has been closed since the start of the war. On the left, video posted by @RadioGenova showing a grid ceiling with red lights as well as a speaker outlined in blue. On the right, screenshot of an Instagram post by Sparks, which features the same ceiling and speaker. © Instagram / SparksClub The final clip (from 0:57 to 1:22) was filmed at Hangover, as indicated by outdoor furniture visible in photos online. The establishment is seasonal, open only between June and August each year. It closed its door ... [Content truncated]",

                    "content": "KYIV — After months of heavy losses in a largely stalled counteroffensive against Russia, tension among Ukraine’s senior leaders has spilled awkwardly into the open in recent days — prompting President Volodymyr Zelensky to call for a halt to political infighting. “Everyone should be concentrating their efforts right now on defending the country,” Zelensky said Monday in his nightly address. “Put themselves together and do not rest; do not drown in infighting or other issues.” He warned that shattered unity could have drastic consequences: “The situation is now the same as it was before — if there is no victory, there will be no country.” Zelensky’s plea to stop any infighting came after he engaged in his own rare public dispute with the commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, over whether the war has reached a World War I-style “stalemate” — as Zaluzhny asserted in a recent interview with the Economist. Zelensky then rebuffed those remarks at a news conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “Everyone is tired and there are different opinions,” Zelensky said when discussing Zaluzhny’s “stalemate” remark. He also told NBC News that he does “not think that this is a stalemate.” But one of the president’s aides went so far as to say on Ukrainian TV that a comment like Zaluzhny’s to the media “eases the work” of Russia. Zaluzhny, a career military officer, enjoys huge national popularity, and he is widely viewed as a potential threat to Zelensky should he ever jump into politics. So far, the general has given no indication that he plans such a move.

Here’s how it could change the weather. Do landlords have to provide AC? Here’s what renters should know. But after 20 months of all-out war, public fissures are starting to appear in Ukraine’s previously unshakable national unity. The issue of a stalemate is especially sensitive because Ukrainian officials fear a perceived deadlock could mean they will be pressured into negotiations with Russia that would force them to cede territory. An overwhelming majority of Ukrainians oppose territorial concessions. The friction among leaders is on full display as Ukraine prepares for the possibility of another brutal winter with virtually no hope of any significant progress on the southern front. Even Zaluzhny has said: “There will most likely be no deep and beautiful breakthrough.” These open disagreements “serve as a distraction from winning the war and definitely play into [the] enemy’s hands,” said Alyona Getmanchuk, founder and director of the New Europe Center, a think tank in Kyiv. “[E]verything starts from … unity inside Ukraine,” Getmanchuk said. The lack of good news is dampening civilian morale, as are growing fears Russia will soon renew its attacks on energy infrastructure that could make life miserable during the coldest months of the year. Grenade in birthday gift kills aide to Ukraine’s top commander The pressure is coming not only from the battlefield. International attention has largely diverted to the war in Israel and Gaza. And in Washington, there are disagreements among lawmakers over additional aid for Ukraine. On Monday, Zelensky publicly dismissed the possibility of holding a presidential election in spring, as would normally occur on Ukraine’s political calendar. Some foreign officials had urged Zelensky to press on with elections, as a show of the country’s commitment to democracy. Zelensky, however, declared that discussions of elections were “utterly irresponsible” during wartime. The country is under martial law, which prohibits holding elections. In addition to thousands of soldiers fighting on the front, millions of Ukrainians have been displaced by the war, which makes holding a fair election almost impossible. Until now, Ukraine had shown solid national unity with political rivalries set aside as the country fought back against the Russian invasion. In recent days in Kyiv, however, some observers have expressed frustration over the sense that infighting has played a role in key decisions with potentially serious effects on the outcome of the war. Last week, for example, Zelensky’s office removed Gen. Viktor Khorenko, who headed the country’s special forces. Khorenko, who served under Zaluzhny, told Ukrainian media outlet Ukrainska Pravda that he did not know the reason for his dismissal and that he “learned about it from the media.” Zaluzhny, he said, also appeared blindsided by the announcement and “could not explain this to me.” Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, whose predecessor Oleksii Reznikov was ousted by Zelensky in September amid a corruption inquiry, said in a statement posted on Facebook that he could not publicly describe the reasons for Khorenko’s dismissal because such revelations could aid Russia. In a top comment on Facebook that was liked hundreds of times, former vice prime minister Pavlo Rozenko criticized Umerov’s handling of the issue. “You made a very big mistake when you made this submission behind Zaluzhny’s back,” Rozenko wrote. “And it is precisely such mistakes that weaken Ukraine in this war! … It is very unfortunate that political intrigues prevail in this situation!” Many others chimed in to criticize the move. One speculated that Khorenko was dismissed because “it was not possible to dislodge Zaluzhny.” The political fractures have further darkened a national mood that was already somber over a series of brutal missile strikes by Russia and other military setbacks. Russian missile strikes brigade in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine says Over the weekend, at least 19 soldiers from Ukraine’s 128th Mountain Assault Brigade were killed when Russia fired a missile at a location near the front where they were gathered for a medal ceremony. The incident drew widespread outrage in Ukraine and is under investigation. The brigade commander was suspended, and Zelensky demanded an investigation into what he described as “a tragedy that could have been avoided.” Then, on Monday, a top aide to Zaluzhny was killed when ...

                    "content": "The latest remarks come after another GOP member said Russian propaganda has ‘infected’ the Republican base\nRep. Michael R. Turner (R-Ohio), who chairs the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said Sunday that it was “absolutely true” that some Republican members of Congress were repeating Russian propaganda about the invasion of Ukraine instigated by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nTurner did not specify which members he was referring to, but he said he agreed with House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Michael McCaul (R-Tex.),  who said in an interview with Puck News last week that Russian propaganda had “infected a good chunk of my party’s base” and suggested that conservative media was to blame.\nWhen asked on Sunday, Turner said he agreed with McCaul’s sentiments.\n“We see directly coming from Russia attempts to mask communications that are anti-Ukraine and pro-Russia messages — some of which we even hear being uttered on the House floor,” Turner said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”\nThe pro-Russia messaging, Turner said, has made it harder for Ukraine’s supporters in the GOP to frame the conflict as “an authoritarian-versus-democracy battle.” “Ukraine needs our help and assistance now, and this is a very critical time for the U.S. Congress to step up and provide that aid,” Turner added.\nBillions of dollars in badly needed military funding for Ukraine has stalled in Congress for months, amid growing opposition from Republicans, and particular vehemence from the GOP’s right flank. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who has proposed forging a “peace treaty with Russia” in lieu of supporting Ukraine, has vowed to remove House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) should he move forward with a vote on an aid package.\nWhen Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in December traveled to Washington to try to secure a breakthrough for additional U.S. military aid, Greene said she was opposed.\nGreene wrote on X, “Why doesn’t anyone in Washington talk about a peace treaty with Russia?? A deal with Putin promising he will not continue any further invasions. Answer: Washington wants war, not peace.”\nU.S. allies and NATO members are also growing increasingly worried about future Russian aggression. The Washington Post reported this weekend that if Donald Trump wins the November election, he is proposing to push Ukraine to cede wide swaths of its territory to Russia, thus expanding the reach of Putin’s dictatorship.\nStill, some lawmakers are more optimistic about getting some type of deal passed. Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.), an outspoken Republican supporter of Ukraine aid, told CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday that he believed Johnson will prioritize passing supplemental security assistance for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan after Congress returns on Tuesday from a two-week recess.\n“I believe he’s fully committed to bringing it up to the floor immediately” after addressing the reauthorization of a contentious national security surveillance program when Congress returns to work, Hill said.\nThe Senate earlier this year approved a $95.3 billion funding package. Many senators have echoed the White House’s warnings that without a fresh infusion of weapons from the United States, Ukraine risks ceding its war to Russia.\nBut Johnson, amid fierce opposition from his far-right flank, has so far refused to bring the Senate package to a vote on the House floor.\nHill, who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, hinted Sunday that Johnson would probably introduce a version of the supplemental national security package that includes an additional provision to redirect certain frozen Russian assets toward paying for Ukraine’s reconstruction.\nHowever, any changes to the legislation in the House would necessitate significant further delays to the provision of aid, by forcing the chambers to reconcile and approve the differences. But Hill said he believed there is widespread bipartisan support for the new provision, known as the REPO Act.\nThe latest: The Ukrainian military has launched a long-anticipated counteroffensive against occupying Russian forces, opening a crucial phase in the war aimed at restoring Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty and preserving Western support in its fight against Moscow.\nThe fight: Ukrainian troops have  intensified their attacks on the front line in the southeast region, according to multiple individuals in the country’s armed forces, in a significant push toward Russian-occupied territory.\nThe front line: The Washington Post has mapped out the 600-mile front line between Ukrainian and Russian forces.\nHow you can help: Here are ways those in the United States can support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.\nRead our full coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war.

Burkina Faso Israel/Palestine Lebanon Sudan Venezuela None South China Sea Democratic Republic of Congo Sudan Kenya Israel/Palestine Burkina Faso None Burkina Faso Our monthly conflict tracker highlights five conflict risks in July. CrisisWatch identified six deteriorations in June. Notably: Aside from the scores of conflict situations we regularly assess, we tracked significant developments in: Bolivia, Cuba, Gabon, Honduras, Madagascar, Moldova, New Caledonia and South Africa. What happened in June? In what could amount to the deadliest attack on the army since anti-jihadist operations began in 2015, the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (JNIM) reportedly killed on 11 June over 100 soldiers in an attack on a military base in Mansila town, Yagha province, Sahel region. The following day, artillery fire hit state television headquarters near the presidential residence in the capital Ouagadougou. Although President Ibrahim Traoré said a soldier had accidentally mishandled a weapon, unconfirmed rumours swirled that the Mansila attack had provoked an army mutiny. Attacks by security forces and jihadists causing mass civilian casualties continued. Why does it matter? The 11 June attack and rumours of growing discontent within the armed forces serve as a stark reminder of Traoré’s inability to halt jihadist violence and stop Burkina Faso’s downward spiral. While the military government publicly insists that it is restoring security, the massacre at Mansila, as with other deadly attacks against the army in the weeks before, illustrates that it has thus far been unable to do so. The attack has exposed and fuelled divisions within the military, leading to speculation of threats to the regime’s grip on power. Caught between jihadists and security forces, civilians are meanwhile paying a heavy price. What to watch in the coming weeks and months? The government’s security failures could threaten its survival. Long-standing divisions within the military are likely to become more prominent, and reports of budget shortages could mean that parts of the security forces are not being paid. President Traoré may increasingly rely on outside support from Africa Corps and Sahelian allies, especially Mali and Niger, to stay in power. Still, if the security situation continues to deteriorate at its current pace, a power struggle could erupt within the military, and lead to Traoré’s ouster. A leadership vacuum could benefit jihadist groups and worsen an already catastrophic humanitarian crisis. As they struggle to get a grip on security, the authorities are likely to continue their heavy-handed crackdown on dissent. They have banned almost all foreign broadcasters and blocked their websites for reporting on human rights groups’ allegations that the security forces are responsible for slaughtering civilians. Some local media have also been banned. Critics of the military regime have been forcibly conscripted or disappeared. Repression will likely increase as the junta tries to bury reports of jihadist attacks on soldiers like the Mansila massacre. The recent extension of a general mobilisation decree means the government will continue to rely on forced conscription to suppress any critical voices. Meantime, villagers across the country – especially in the Est, Centre-Est, Sahel, Centre-Nord, Nord, Boucle du Mouhoun regions – find themselves trapped between jihadist groups and security forces, both of which often use indiscriminate violence. Widespread displacement – with at least two million currently on the move – is unlikely to end soon as civilians fear returning to areas recently recaptured by the government for fear of persistent insecurity and as jihadists maintain a blockade on dozens of towns. What should be done? Recognising that it will need popular support to defeat the jihadists, the government should place a much higher emphasis on protecting communities and curbing abuse within its ranks. Western partners should continue to engage with the military regime in Ouagadougou in non-security sectors, particularly promoting social cohesion and community dialogue as part of an effort to convince the authorities of the utility of non-military solutions to insecurity. To ensure that massacres of civilians are not forgotten or silenced by state-controlled media, Western partners should also make public statements whenever large-scale massacres are committed by one of the parties to the conflict. Western partners should also continue to help humanitarian actors and relevant ministries provide humanitarian assistance to populations in need, notably internally displaced people, that are an estimated 10 per cent of a total population of 22 million. Detention of Nigerien nationals ratcheted up bilateral tensions; threat of jihadist spillover from neighbouring countries remained high. Diplomatic standoff with Niger continued with arrest of Nigerien oil workers. Bilateral tensions persisted as Niger refused to reopen its land border and oil exports through shared pipeline faced blockages from both govts. Authorities 5 June arrested five Nigeriens working for Chinese-Nigerien operator of pipeline (WAPCo), alleging they fraudulently attempted to access oil terminal and accusing them of spying; in response, Niamey next day blocked oil exports from their side and 8 June denounced “kidnapping” of workers (see Niger). Govt 13 June released two of those detained but 17 June convicted other three, including WAPCo deputy director general, of falsifying data, giving them 18-month suspended sentence; relatively lenient sentence seen by many as attempt at compromise while former presidents Bony Yayi and Soglo 25 June travelled to Niger and met Nigerien President Gen. Tiani and PM Zeine in attempt to ease tensions; oil exports, however, remained on hold. Jihadist violence continued in north. Pendjari National Park and others including W Park remained vulnerable to jihadist infiltration from Burkina Faso and Niger despite ongoing deployment of troops in area. Notably, gunmen 4 June killed seven soldiers in ambush near Tanguieta town in Pendjari park in ... [Content truncated]",
