[+] which is allowed to visit by the city authorities on August 13, 2023 in Odesa, Ukraine. In Odesa six beaches were officially opened for swimming - for the first time since the start of a full-scale war. (смысловой повтор текста). However, people also continue to swim on the other beaches of the city, where swimming is prohibited. (Photo by Viacheslav Onyshchenko/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images) A number of videos featuring bikini-clad women made the rounds on Twitter this weekend, but not for the reasons some might expect. The clips purported to show a beach on the Black Sea near the Ukrainian city of Odesa after it reportedly reopened for the first time since Russia's invasion. The post was met with a backlash as those critical of U.S. and other Western aid being provided to Ukraine voiced their frustration that it didn't resemble a warzone. However, other users on Twitter soon weighed in that the video was actually filmed at the Strandbad Plötzensee, a lake in the city of Berlin, Germany! Another video also circulated showing a party-like gathering at the Ibiza Beach Club in Odesa. It does resemble the images and videos on the club's official website, and it is—or at least was—a very popular hotspot, yet, it remains unclear when the video may have actually been filmed. The club's Facebook page hasn't been updated since 2018 and no videos have been posted to its YouTube page since July of 2021—more than six months before Russia launched its unprovoked invasion. It would appear that the Ibiza Beach Club in Odesa may still be closed. However, there is a grain of truth to the story. As Reuters reported on Saturday, several beaches in the city have been officially opened for swimming, but bathing in the sea is banned during air raid alerts. It is also important to note the city has been repeatedly attacked with missiles and drones, while the waters have been littered with hundreds of sea mines. In other words, people may be swimming in Ukraine, but it is hardly the party atmosphere some on social media have suggested. \"This is a classic piece of disinformation. There are a few interesting things about this. First, this is what I always think of as a 'cheap fake' instead of a 'DeepFake,'\" said Dr. Cliff Lampe, professor of information and associate dean for academic affairs in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. \"The only thing they did was to add a tag to an already existing video,\" explained Lampe. \"No AI needed, just the simplest of video techniques. We've seen this several times, and these cheap fakes are very prevalent as a type of disinformation.\" Lampe added that whoever first posted the video was also clever in that it uses attractive people to immediately grab attention, but then also layers on sexual moral judgment onto anti-Biden or anti-war intents. \"Disinformation needs to gather attention, which this effectively did, and it is more effective when it hits on multiple levels of outrage,\" said Lampe. \"I wouldn't say this changed any minds. That's usually not the goal behind disinformation—which is more about deepening already held beliefs and calling into question the very nature of truth itself. Clearly, this was a successful effort.\" What was also notable with these videos is that the online sleuths quickly identified that one of the videos was filmed in Germany, while some were wrong that the other wasn't actually Odessa. That could make others question a fact-checker if they turn out to be wrong. It also makes us question whether we can even trust fact-checkers in general! \"It depends on the post and the fact-checkers. I'd believe Bellingcat without question because they disclose their methodology and they have a track record,\" suggested Dr. Matthew Schmidt, associate professor in the National Security Department at the University of New Haven. \"If someone replied to this with convincing photographic evidence, which was then agreed to by the consensus of responses, I'd be inclined to believe it,\" Schmidt continued. \"The point is that there's a great wealth of talent in the open source community, so they've repeatedly shown they're right about things.\" However, it could still be good to be skeptical by default. \"Like a scientist saying 'I believe X with 75% confidence, but Y with 90%.' People need to think in probabilities, then they can use open source intel intelligently,\" Schmidt noted. \"It's not just right or wrong, it's shades of right enoughness.\" On the surface having open source fact-checkers could seem to be a case of \"who guards the guardians\"—Quis custodiet ipsos custodes. However, Schmidt dismissed that notion. \"This isn't so much who guards the guardians—because these guys on the Internet aren't the guardians—but who is guarding the gate to true intelligence,\" Schmidt pondered. \"Is it the guardians at the CIA or the crowd? Because the amount of open source Intel that drives analysis at places like the CIA would surprise people. They're feeding the guardians. And the really TS/SCI (Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information) stuff is the dessert, not the main meal.\" One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

                "content": "As fighting in eastern Ukraine intensifies, with its forces resisting Russian advances toward the north and south of Severodonetsk and elsewhere, the country remains locked in violent, attritional warfare. With conflict largely shifted to the east, the intensity of warfare may well be felt less in other parts of the country (the largest in Europe by land area discounting Russia) where people have been photographed recently enjoying summer weather. These pictures, however, have led some to claim that Ukraine has not been as badly bombarded as media reports hereto have suggested. The Claim A tweet posted on June 16, 2022, shows dozens of people using what appears to be a small beach in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. The tweet, which has more than 10,000 engagements, was posted by YouTuber Alex Belfield, who suggests that the media are making exaggerated and misleading claims about the conflict's severity. Ermmm. Ukraine doesn’t look like a warzone to me today? How about you?I’m starting to question the MSM. Maybe they don’t tell us the whole story???? 😝 pic.twitter.com/vUlEmd5sHZ Similar tweets have also been dismissive of the scenes captured in Kyiv. The devastated and war-torn country of Ukraine... we should definitely keep sending them billions of dollars...https://t.co/m2tCdP6GtF The Facts The photos pictured in the tweets are from Kyiv, taken along the Dnieper River, which intersects the east and west of the city. These beachy areas have long been a popular spot for swimming and sunbathing in the Ukrainian capital, with this year being no exception. Being the second-largest country in Europe after Russia, it's reasonable to believe that some parts of Ukraine may see less direct military action than others. While the capital is not invulnerable and has also been shelled in past weeks, the current battlegrounds in the northeast and Donbas regions are a considerable distance from Kyiv. Kharkiv, for example, which Russian forces have still not claimed, is around a six-hour drive away. During the first two months of the war, following Russian bombardment, Ukrainian forces were able to push the invading forces from the capital and adjacent territories, although concerns remain that President Vladimir Putin's army may attempt to take Kyiv in a second assault. By some accounts, this pause has somewhat cooled the mood in Kyiv. Nonetheless, Ukrainian government officials have warned citizens not to visit beaches as authorities continue to survey the water nearby for explosive objects. A Washington Post article published June 12, 2022, reported how divers have been finding unexploded munitions in lakes throughout Kyiv's suburbs too. As well as the threat of explosive devices, the divers told the Post their own fears that Russian spies and saboteurs may be watching their work, \"helping the Russians plan a new invasion in this part of the country,\" the report states, describing the absence of swimmers, motorboats and jet skis as \"surreal.\" Moreover, while the photos taken along the Dnieper river and elsewhere may look picturesque, Kyiv still endures occasional airstrikes as volunteers take to clearing some of the destruction caused earlier this year. Air raid warnings are issued across much of the country on an almost daily basis. But even in other parts of the country, where the threat of conflict is more palpable, residents have been pictured using beaches and public spaces too. In unverified posts Newsweek found on social media app Telegram, video recordings appear to show Ukrainians in Odessa (far closer to the theatre of war than Kyiv) reading poetry in public as missile defense systems fire behind them, and sunbathing on the beach by barriers installed to prevent sea invasion. Other posts claim citizens have died from mines while using Odessa's coastline (the post can be found here [graphic content warning]). It also goes without saying that photos depicting the actions of a select group of people may not necessarily reflect the actions and attitudes of others. In 2020, thousands of people visited public beaches and parks in the U.S. and Europe in spite of COVID-19 social distancing restrictions, no working vaccines, and large case numbers. For many it becomes a show of defiance, as the liberties taken away during these types of crises become more important than the risks of exercising them (although with fighting in Kyiv far less frequent than in other parts of the country, that sense of risk may be diminished for now). What the tweets by Alex Belfield (who has published misleading claims elsewhere) and others seemingly lack are both the well-documented evidence of the conflict, and a more nuanced understanding of how people strive for normality even in despairing circumstances. The Ruling False. The photos shared on Twitter do not disprove the existence or intensity of the conflict in Ukraine. While there are photos of people enjoying the beaches in Kyiv, this is not proof that the conflict has been exaggerated by the media. Moreover, footage in embattled parts of the country appears to show residents doing the same thing despite the heightened risk, as they seek to maintain some sense of normality in a brutal war.
