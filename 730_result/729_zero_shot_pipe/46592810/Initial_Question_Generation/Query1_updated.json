The 71.6-acre property, seen here in an aerial view, includes a main compound and four guest villas.\n The private islands that were a nexus in Jeffrey Epstein's depraved abuse and trafficking of young women and underage girls will be turned into a resort destination by a U.S. billionaire. Great St. James and Little St. James have been in limbo since Epstein's death in 2019. \nFinancier Stephen Deckoff paid $60 million for Great St. James and Little St. James through his SD Investments firm, a spokesperson told NPR. Deckoff is the founder of Black Diamond Capital Management.\nThe purchase price reflects a steep discount from the $110 million for which the two properties were recently listed.\nLittle St. James spans around 71.6 acres and includes \"a helipad, private dock, gas station, high-capacity water filtration, 2 pools, the main compound, 4 guest villas, 3 private beaches, gym, tiki hut,\" and other buildings, according to its real estate listing.\n\n                Little St. James includes private beaches and a number of buildings.

The island sits close to St. Thomas.\nThe pair of islands initially went on the market in March of 2022, with a $125 million asking price. The listing figure was later reduced after no buyers materialized.\nThe two islands, which lie just off St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands, figured prominently in the civil and criminal cases against...[Content truncated]",

George.\n    \n\n            The suit, filed Wednesday, alleges that Epstein used a system of private planes, helicopters, boats and vehicles to bring young women and girls to his island residence on Little St. James. There, the victims were “deceptively subjected to sexual servitude, forced to engage in sexual acts and coerced into commercial sexual activity and forced labor,” the lawsuit says.\n    \n\n            The scheme led to the molestation and exploitation of “numerous” girls between 12 and 17 years old, the suit alleges.\n    \n\n            The lawsuit says that flight logs and other sources established that the enterprise stretched from 2001 to 2019. As recently as 2018, the lawsuit says, air traffic controllers and other airport personnel reported seeing Epstein leave his plane with young girls who appeared to be between 11 and 18 years old.\n    \n\n            The scheme described in the suit is remarkably similar...[Content truncated]",

They provide comprehensive coverage of both national and international news and often fact-check claims made in the political arena. However, the network has faced criticism for perceived bias and sensationalism in its reporting, particularly in the context of opinion pieces. This perceived bias somewhat affects their overall credibility, thus leading to a slightly lower score compared to NPR."

Prosecutors filed a civil lawsuit that accuses Epstein of human trafficking that victimized young women and children as young as 11.\nProsecutors in the U.S. Virgin Islands have unveiled a new lawsuit against the estate of Jeffrey Epstein alleging that over two decades he ran a conspiracy in which he transported young women and girls to his private Caribbean islands by helicopter and boat and then subjected them to sexual abuse. \nAuthorities claim Epstein's sexual predation on the hideaway islands occurred as recently as 2018 and involved children as young as 11 years old. The suit alleges the activity was covered up by Epstein's associates through a complex web of corporations. \nIn one instance, investigators say a 15-year-old who was forced into sexual acts with Epstein attempted to escape by swimming off one of Epstein's private islands, Little St. James. Eventually, Epstein's crew found her after assembling a search team and took her passport, prosecutors say.\nAlong with Epstein's other privately owned island, Great St. James, authorities estimate that the islands are worth $86 million, just a slice of Epstein's total assets, valued by the government to be more than $577 million.\nThe lawsuit filed by Attorney General Denise George seeks to confiscate all property used in the alleged criminal conspiracy, including his two private islands, and is asking for the recovery of millions of dollars from the Epstein estate. Epstein's victims would be the beneficiaries of what authorities are hoping to seize, George said.\nAddressing reporters on Wednesday, George said the civil suit detailed an \"expansive scheme\" that shows a \"pattern and practice of human trafficking, sexual abuse and forced labor of young women.\"\nEpstein, who authorities say died by suicide in jail last year while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges, faced accusations of sexually abusing young women and children in New York and Florida, but those allegations were dated no later than 2005.\nThe lawsuit filed this week by Virgin Islands prosecutors significantly widens the scope of his alleged sexual abuse to include conduct in 2018, the same year public scrutiny began to mount on the wealthy money manager in the wake of a Miami Herald investigation into his long history of alleged sexual abuse. \nThe lawsuit filed on Tuesday lays out how Epstein allegedly enticed and entrapped dozens of victims.\nAs the prosecutors tell it, his associates would locate young women and lure them with the promise of advancing a modeling career, pursuing educational opportunities or landing other work. Epstein would then arrange for the victims to visit his...[Content truncated]",

These are [photographs of] salacious acts of girls, young girls doing things to each other that would be considered child pornography,\" she added.  \nThose named in the Epstein documents include former presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, former Maine Sen.
