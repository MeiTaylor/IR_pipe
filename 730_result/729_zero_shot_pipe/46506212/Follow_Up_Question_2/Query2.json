Nonetheless, Ukrainian government officials have warned citizens not to visit beaches as authorities continue to survey the water nearby for explosive objects.\nA Washington Post article published June 12, 2022, reported how divers have been finding unexploded munitions in lakes throughout Kyiv's suburbs too.\nAs well as the threat of explosive devices, the divers told the Post their own fears that Russian spies and saboteurs may be watching their work, \"helping the Russians plan a new invasion in this part of the country,\" the report states, describing the absence of swimmers, motorboats and jet skis as \"surreal.\"\nMoreover, while the photos taken along the Dnieper river and elsewhere may look picturesque, Kyiv still endures occasional airstrikes as volunteers take to clearing some of the destruction caused earlier this year.\nAir raid warnings are issued across much of the country on an almost daily basis. But even in other parts of the country, where the threat of conflict is more palpable, residents have been pictured using beaches and public spaces too.\nIn unverified posts Newsweek found on social media app Telegram, video recordings appear to show Ukrainians in Odessa (far closer to the theatre of war than Kyiv) reading poetry in public as missile defense systems fire behind them, and sunbathing on the beach by barriers installed to prevent sea invasion.\nOther posts claim citizens have died from mines while using Odessa's coastline (the post can be found here [graphic content warning]).\nIt also goes without saying that photos depicting the actions of a select group of people may not necessarily reflect the actions and attitudes of others. In 2020, thousands of people visited public beaches and parks in the U.S. and Europe in spite of COVID-19 social distancing restrictions, no working vaccines, and large case numbers.\nFor many it becomes a show of defiance, as the liberties taken away during these types of crises become more important than the risks of exercising them (although with fighting in Ky...[Content truncated]",

The Ka-52, known as the \"Alligator\" by Russia and \"Hokum-B\" by NATO, has been described by military experts as one of Russia's most capable attack helicopters.\n\"At this stage, we are destroying them with missile attacks,\" Shtupun said, adding that Moscow's forces have been forced to switch tactics and launch attacks with Ka-52 helicopters from far away.\n\"The Russians are not currently entering the effective range of our air defense,\" he said. \"Our soldiers have learned to shoot them down quite professionally. So the Russians are launching their attacks from afar.\n\"These helicopters are far less effective at a considerable distance than if they flew closer.
