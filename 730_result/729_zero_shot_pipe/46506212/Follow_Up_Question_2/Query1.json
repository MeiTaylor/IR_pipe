We also discussed steps to implement the Peace Formula and prepare security guarantees for Ukraine.\n    \n\n            Zelensky said that Russia was ramping up production of missiles made with Western components and he emphasized the need to increase sanctions pressure during the call with Sunak.\n    \n\n            Russia’s Ministry of Defense has claimed that a Ukrainian stronghold was destroyed by a remotely-controlled tank packed with a huge amount of explosives, in what appears to be a new battlefield tactic.\n    \n\n            In a post on its Telegram channel at the weekend, the ministry said that “about 3.5 tons of TNT and 5 FAB-100 bombs” were packed into the tank. FAB-100 bombs normally carry a 100-kilogram (220-pound) payload.\n    \n\n            In a video shared by the ministry on Saturday, a Russian tank commander, callsign “Bernaul,” said he was assigned with the task of setting up the tank and executing the attack.\n    \n\n...[Content truncated]",

J.D. Vance spoke briefly to reporters outside his home in Cincinnati on Saturday and said he’s been told former President Donald Trump is “doing OK” after being injured at his rally. \n    \n\n        “I’ve heard he’s doing OK,” Vance told reporters. \n    \n\n\n\n            Vance is one of Trump’s potential running mates.\n    \n\n            One attendee at the Trump rally described the shooting on Saturday night as “complete pandemonium,” with some in the crowd unsure of what was happening at first.\n    \n\n            “It seemed initially like firecrackers went off,” Joseph Meyn told CNN from Butler, Pennsylvania, where the shooting happened.\n    \n\n        “One half of the crowd on the far end of the rally thought it was some type of weird joke, the other half of the crowd knew it wasn’t, and was trying to push or impress upon the rest of the crowd that this is serious. I think everyone got the idea of — very quickly — that it was a dangerous situation, and everyone just started hitting the deck,” he said.\n    \n\n            He described seeing a man in the bleachers near him hit in the head by gunfire, and another woman nearby being hit in the arm. He said it was hard to figure out which direction the gunfire was coming from, and he added that police moved quickly to clear the bleachers.\n    \n\n            “It’s something you don’t expect … it’s very shocking,” Meyn added. “We shouldn’t be at a level of public political discourse in this country where this is going on, it feels like it’s 1960.”\n    \n\n            Meyn, a surgeon from Grove City, Pennsylvania, said he looked back in the direction the gunshots had come from. “I saw a man in the bleachers was hit directly in the head, and died instantly. There was a woman who was hit in the hand and forearm, a noncritical wound,” he said.\n    \n\n            He said he went to see whether he could render aid, but another doctor was already helping the woman who’d been shot. \n    \n\n        “I helped carry the body of the man out of the stands. They took the body to the tent behind the bleachers,” Meyn said...[Content truncated]",

Bush White House official, told CNN recently. “These things are outside of a president’s direct control.” \n    \n\n            Also, the US consumes a different kind of oil than it produces, McNally told CNN last year.

They are not alone, with recent polling in the US suggesting an increasing percentage of Americans think Washington is providing too much aid to Ukraine. \n    \n\n            Little wonder then that the Ukrainian government’s sweeping crackdown on corruption was swift and harsh. Raids were ordered on a wide range of officials on the national, regional and local levels. It even targeted one of Zelensky’s former backers, the once-untouchable billionaire Ihor Kolomoisky, who earlier stood accused of bilking a major Ukrainian bank of billions of dollars. (Kolomoisky, who has previously denied any wrongdoing, has not publicly commented on the recent raid.)\n    \n\n            But as some Ukrainian commentators have noted, many officials were allowed to gracefully resign rather than face sacking and further punishment. Anastasia Bolshedvor, who has gained a large social media following as an unofficial government watchdog, questioned whether the shakeup — coming almost a year into the war — was a show or a genuine step in the war against corruption. \n    \n\n            Similarly, Yevhen Hlibovytsky, former political journalist and founder of the Kyiv-based think tank and consultancy, pro.mova, told me: “Zelensky’s fight with corruption would have been more convincing if it was started at his own stables and followed with the institutional changes.” That said, he also added that no battle with corruption should be allowed to disrupt the war effort.\n    \n\n            In the recent crackdown, Zelensky may also be opening himself up to accusations of overreach. When a member of the Zelensky faction in Parliament was discovered sunning himself on a Thai beach while his country is in the midst of a war, the government responded by promptly booting the lawmaker from the ruling party. \n\n\n\nZelensky shakes up Ukrainian government amid growing corruption scandal\n\n\n            But it also took the extreme step of banning lawmakers from traveling overseas, and just at a time when they should be seen to be ambassadors for the country, amplifying Zelensky’s call for more military aid. \n    \n\n            Odesa member of parliament, Oleksiy Goncharenko, went so far to call it an illegal move that violated the Ukrainian constitution. “The rights of MPs cannot be limited, even in the time of martial law,” he told me.\n    \n\n            “The decision was made in reaction to some MPs that were found on the beaches of warm countries. They should be the ones to pay the political price.\n    \n\n...[Content truncated]",

Instead, it came in letter posted to social media as he recovered from Covid-19 at his beach house in Delaware.\n    \n\n            It was a low-key way to reveal one of the most historic decisions in modern American politics, but time was not on Biden’s side to reach a decision or make an announcement. Never before has a president left a reelection race this close to Election Day – and for 24 days it seemed as if he were stubbornly planning to ride out the storm that followed the June 27 CNN debate in Atlanta.\n    \n\n            He spent the three weeks after the debate repeating that he was staying in the race against former President Donald Trump. The president dug in. He insisted he could beat Trump. His inner circle shrank to his closest aides and family. He was forced to retreat to Delaware, where he reached a decision in the last day and a half, finally conceding that a man loyal to the Democratic Party for more than half a century was seen as a drag on the...[Content truncated]",

Yet, since then, and a little more than a year after Russia invaded, the Leopolis has continued to be open for business without a pause.\n    \n\n            The hotel’s management even decided to continue a renovation that began in 2019, completing it in the summer of 2022, at a time when air strikes were raining down on the city.\n    \n\n            “We had to stop the renovation for a couple of months but, after discussing it with the owners, we decided to continue it to be ready when the war ends,” says General Manager Kateryna Matiushchenko.\n    \n\n            This optimism isn’t unfounded. Even during the war, the occupancy rate of the 70 rooms at the Leopolis generally surpassed occupancy during much of Covid. \n    \n\n            “January and February 2023 were not that bad,” Matiushchenko says. “Better than we planned, given the constant threat of massive attacks and electricity switch-offs.”\n    \n\n            Since its opening in 2007, the Leopolis has been a popular hotel. Centrally located in Lviv’s Old Town, it sponsors an annual Leopolis Jazz Fest and is a favorite of those attending the...[Content truncated]",
