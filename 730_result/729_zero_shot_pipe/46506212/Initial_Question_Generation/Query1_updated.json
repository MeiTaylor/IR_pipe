But her elderly mother refuses to leave. \n\"I can't leave her,\" Hanna tells us over the phone. \"She said she wanted to sleep in her own bed. She's 71 and has problems with her legs. If she stays alone, she can't get water or wood for heating.\"\nHoled up precariously in a fifth floor flat, living under near constant bombardment and air strikes, they're among the last remaining residents of Avdiivka. \nThis strategically important and fiercely contested town lies right on the front line in eastern Ukraine. \nMost people have fled. There's been fighting here since 2014, but since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of last February, the population has shrunk from more than 30,000 to just over 1,000. \nRussia launched a major offensive on the town earlier this month and fighting has intensified in recent days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the situation as \"particularly tough\".\n\"Windows and doors are broken everywhere,\" says Hanna. \"With attacks every day, it's difficult to fix them because they get broken again every day.\"\nThe town is sometimes described as the gateway to the city of Donetsk, which has been occupied by Russia and its proxy forces since 2014. Taking Avdiivka - which lies close by - would allow them to push the front line back, making it harder for the Ukrainian forces to retake the territory. \nTo venture out to the last remaining shop in town, Hanna says, is to take life into your own hands. \n\"There are no places where you can hide in case of an attack\u2026 if you hear a whistle, you don't have enough time to get to safety.\"\nThat shop has since been destroyed.\nAvdiivka's residents now rely all the more on a facility known as a Point of Invincibility. You'll find these government-built help stations all over this country; designed to provide food, warmth, power and refuge. \nAnd, for some in Avdiivka, the...[Content truncated]",

The evidence strongly supports the assertion that the conflict is real and ongoing."

The two countries have since sought to cool the row down.\nMr Morawiecki was interviewed on Wednesday night by the private Polsat news TV channel hours after the Ukrainian ambassador had been summoned to the foreign ministry in Warsaw in response to the Ukrainian leader's speech.\n\"We are no longer transferring weapons to Ukraine, because we are now arming Poland with more modern weapons,\" the prime minister said.\nHe was adamant Poland was helping Ukraine defeat the \"Russian barbarian\" by maintaining a military hub, but would not agree to Poland's markets being destabilised by grain imports, Polish state news agency Pap reported.\n\"Our hub in Rzeszow, in agreement with the Americans and Nato, is fulfilling the same role the whole time as it has fulfilled and will fulfil.\"\nPoland's military hardware has been depleted by about a third through transfers to Ukraine and Warsaw is in the process of replacing it with modern Western-produced kit.\nArms exports to Ukraine will not stop completely as Polish manufacturer PGZ is due to send about 60 Krab artillery weapons in the coming months. Government spokesman Piotr Muller later clarified that only previously agreed deliveries of ammunition and armaments would be delivered, including those from contracts signed with Ukraine.\nAsked about the prime minister's comments, Polish state assets minister Jacek Sasin told Radio Plus on Thursday that \"at the moment it is as the prime minister said - in...[Content truncated]",

The meeting proceeded but discussions about the aid package soon descended into chaos.\nMr Zelensky's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said earlier on Tuesday there was a \"big risk\" of Ukrainian defeat without continued US support.\n\"It will be difficult to keep in [the] same positions and for the people to really survive,\" he added, in a speech at the US Institute of Peace in Washington DC.\nMr Yermak's dire assessment was given just hours before Mr Zelensky pulled out.\nUkraine's embassy in Washington DC did not immediately respond to a BBC question asking for further explanation for the cancellation. \nIt comes on the heels of a renewed push by the White House for additional support for Ukraine. The US Congress, however, is still not close to a deal on a compromise spending package that would help fund the war effort.\n\"We are out of money - and nearly out of time,\" wrote Shalanda Young, the White House budget director, in a letter to Republican and Democratic leaders published on Monday. \nShe warned that a failure by Congress to approve more military aid to Ukraine before the end of the year would \"kneecap\" the nation in its fight against Russia and that there was no \"magic pot of funding\" left to draw from.\nOn Monday, however, the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, seemed dismissive of the latest pleas to provide tens of billions of dollars more in funding.\n\"The Biden Administration has failed to substantively address any of my conference's legitimate concerns about the lack of a clear strategy in Ukraine, a path to resolving the conflict, or a plan for adequately ensuring accountability for aid provided by American taxpayers,\" he wrote on social media.\nThe funding impasse comes as fighting on the frontlines appears to have reached a practical stalemate. \nUkraine's much anticipated counter-offensive in the south appears...[Content truncated]",

Nearly 8,000 people have been evacuated from these areas since May 10, when Russia launched its push.\u00a0\n    \n\n            At least 1,993 children in Ukraine have been killed or wounded since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022, according to the UN\u2019s children\u2019s agency (UNICEF), reiterating calls for a ceasefire.\n    \n\n            On average, at least two children lose their lives in Ukraine every day, UNICEF reported on Tuesday. \n    \n\n        \u201cUkraine\u2019s children urgently need safety, stability, access to safe learning, child protection services, and psychosocial support,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cMore than anything, Ukraine\u2019s children need peace.\u201d\n    \n\nMental health impact: The war in Ukraine has \u201charmfully affected\u201d the mental health and wellbeing of children, UNICEF said, adding that half of teenagers report trouble sleeping. At least one in five suffer intrusive thoughts and flashbacks.\n    \n\nLoss of education: Almost half of children enrolled in school in Ukraine have been robbed of in-person education, according to the report. Nearly one million children across the country cannot access any in-person learning \u201cdue to insecurity,\u201d UNICEF added. \n    \n\n            Earlier this year, CNN reported on Ukrainian children attending newly built bunker schools in the northern city of Kharkiv, as daily Russian strikes rained down overhead.  \n    \n\n            US Secretary of State Antony\u00a0Blinken\u00a0announced Wednesday the provision of additional $2 billion in foreign military financing for Ukraine and said much-needed weapons and ammunition are being rushed to the front lines.\u00a0\n    \n\n        \u201cUkraine is facing this renewed brutal Russian onslaught,\u201d\u00a0Blinken\u00a0said during a news conference in Kyiv, speaking alongside Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, adding he discussed...[Content truncated]",

Nato partner nation New Zealand said on Sunday the munitions could cause \"huge damage to innocent people\".\nCluster bombs typically release lots of smaller bomblets that can kill indiscriminately over a wide area. Unexploded bomblets can linger on the ground for years before they detonate.\nThe US says it has received written reassurances from Kyiv that Ukrainian troops will not use the weapons in Russia or in urban areas.\nWhile in the UK, Mr Biden will also meet King Charles for the first time since the King was crowned.\nMembers of Nato - a military alliance of 31 Western nations - will then meet in Vilnius on Tuesday and Wednesday. Boosting ammunition stockpiles and reviewing defence plans will be on the agenda.\nFinland will attend its first summit since joining in April, and plans from Sweden to follow suit have been blocked by Turkey, which accuses it of harbouring terrorists.
