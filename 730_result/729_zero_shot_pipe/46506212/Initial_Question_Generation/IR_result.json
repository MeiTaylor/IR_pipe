The meeting proceeded but discussions about the aid package soon descended into chaos.\nMr Zelensky's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said earlier on Tuesday there was a \"big risk\" of Ukrainian defeat without continued US support.\n\"It will be difficult to keep in [the] same positions and for the people to really survive,\" he added, in a speech at the US Institute of Peace in Washington DC.\nMr Yermak's dire assessment was given just hours before Mr Zelensky pulled out.\nUkraine's embassy in Washington DC did not immediately respond to a BBC question asking for further explanation for the cancellation. \nIt comes on the heels of a renewed push by the White House for additional support for Ukraine. The US Congress, however, is still not close to a deal on a compromise spending package that would help fund the war effort.\n\"We are out of money - and nearly out of time,\" wrote Shalanda Young, the White House budget director, in a letter to Republican and Democratic leaders published on Monday. \nShe warned that a failure by Congress to approve more military aid to Ukraine before the end of the year would \"kneecap\" the nation in its fight against Russia and that there was no \"magic pot of funding\" left to draw from.\nOn Monday, however, the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, seemed dismissive of the latest pleas to provide tens of billions of dollars more in funding.\n\"The Biden Administration has failed to substantively address any of my conference's legitimate concerns about the lack of a clear strategy in Ukraine, a path to resolving the conflict, or a plan for adequately ensuring accountability for aid provided by American taxpayers,\" he wrote on social media.\nThe funding impasse comes as fighting on the frontlines appears to have reached a practical stalemate. \nUkraine's much anticipated counter-offensive in the south appears...[Content truncated]",

        "Question": "Is there evidence of ongoing conflict in Kyiv contradicting a peaceful beach party portrayal?",
        "Answer": "Yes, there is substantial evidence of ongoing conflict in Ukraine that contradicts the portrayal of a peaceful beach party in Kyiv.\n\n1. **Continuous Conflict in Avdiivka**: A recent report describes the dire situation in Avdiivka, where civilians are suffering under constant bombardment. The town has been heavily affected by fighting, with the population dwindling from over 30,000 to just over 1,000 due to the ongoing conflict. The intense urban warfare and air strikes highlight that many areas in Ukraine are experiencing severe conflict, which sharply contrasts the serene setting depicted in the beach party video [Query1_evidence1····].\n\n2. **Prolonged Military Stalemate**: An analysis from November 2023 indicates that the battlefield situation in Ukraine remains grim, with no significant breakthroughs expected. The Ukrainian military chief noted that the conflict continues to drag on, with Russian forces maintaining substantial control over a fifth of Ukraine. This suggests that, despite some areas possibly appearing tranquil, the overarching reality is one of sustained military engagement and crises, which further contradicts any notion of a hoax regarding the war [Query1_evidence2····].\n\n3. **Missile Attacks on Kyiv**: Ensuing updates give insight into missile, drone, and bombing attacks targeting Kyiv, reinforcing that the conflict is active and ongoing. Such military actions directly contradict the imagery of a carefree beach activity, indicating that while some areas might seem peaceful in the moment, the threat of violence and actual warfare is ever-present [Query2_evidence1····].\n\nThrough this analysis, it is clear that the portrayal of a leisure setting like a beach party in Kyiv is at odds with the reality of the conflict, which is evidenced by the severe conditions faced by civilians and military assessments.",
