They have also made small gains in the village of Starytsia and have advanced closer to the village of Lyptsi to the west.\nRussia has intensified its attacks on the region following Friday's surprise incursions across the border, seizing several villages and settlements in one of the most significant ground attacks since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. \nVovchansk, located 74km (45 miles) from Kharkiv, has been heavily bombed in recent days. While it is a significant town in the region, Vovchansk is not of specific military importance, though its capture would be a blow to Ukrainian morale.\nHowever, Ukrainian officials say they are stabilising the situation and that the tempo of Russian operations in the area is decreasing.\nThousands of civilians have fled towards Kharkiv and there are concerns among Ukrainian commanders about what could happen if Russian troops get within artillery-range of the city.\nThe UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) assessment is that Russia is \"almost certainly attempting to divert Ukrainian resources away from other parts of the front line\", but adds: \"It is unlikely that Russia has built up sufficient combat power to take the city (Kharkiv) without diverting additional forces into the area.\"\nBut BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale, who is in the area, says it will be hard to dislodge the Russian forces in the region and that there are believed to be about 30,000 more troops just over the border.\nThe incursion is some miles from the main front line to the east where Russia has continued its offensive operations and been edging forwards since October 2023.\nThe MoD noted that Russian attacks intensified further in April - up 17% from March - with more than three quarters on the areas around...[Content truncated]",

Many people have sought refuge in neighbouring countries.\nThe latest data show 21,388,745 border crossings into Poland, 4,951,795 to Romania, 2,852,395 to Russia, 5,191,955 to Hungary, 2,471,670 to Slovakia, 1,142,655 to Moldova and 16,705 into Belarus. Most of those displaced have been women and children. Men aged 18 to 60 have been asked to remain in Ukraine to fight.\n\nÂ \nBelow are ten infographics that break down the history, politics and economics of the Ukraine-Russia crisis.\nAfter months of tensions and intense diplomacy, Russian forces invaded Ukraine. Explosions were heard across the country. Kyiv declared martial law, saying Ukraine will defend itself. Below is a summary of the conflict at a glance.\nRussia and Ukraine were part of the 15 Soviet republics that made up the Soviet Union. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine declared independence on August 24. The map below shows when each of these countries declared independence.\nAfter independence, Ukraine moved to shed its Russian imperial legacy and forge increasingly close ties with the West.\nOver the past 30 years, Ukraine has been led by seven presidents. The country has had a rocky path towards democracy with two revolutions, first in 2005 and then in 2014. Both times, protesters rejected Russiaâs supremacy and sought a path to join the European Union and NATO.\nBy comparison, Russia has been led by three presidents, with Putin having been in office for 17 years. In 2021, Putin, the former agent of the Soviet Unionâs KGB security services,...[Content truncated]",

Do I feel this way because Ukrainians, being fellow Europeans, âlook like meâ?\nMaybe.
