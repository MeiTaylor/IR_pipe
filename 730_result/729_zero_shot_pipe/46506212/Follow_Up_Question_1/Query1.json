They have also made small gains in the village of Starytsia and have advanced closer to the village of Lyptsi to the west.\nRussia has intensified its attacks on the region following Friday's surprise incursions across the border, seizing several villages and settlements in one of the most significant ground attacks since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. \nVovchansk, located 74km (45 miles) from Kharkiv, has been heavily bombed in recent days. While it is a significant town in the region, Vovchansk is not of specific military importance, though its capture would be a blow to Ukrainian morale.\nHowever, Ukrainian officials say they are stabilising the situation and that the tempo of Russian operations in the area is decreasing.\nThousands of civilians have fled towards Kharkiv and there are concerns among Ukrainian commanders about what could happen if Russian troops get within artillery-range of the city.\nThe UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) assessment is that Russia is \"almost certainly attempting to divert Ukrainian resources away from other parts of the front line\", but adds: \"It is unlikely that Russia has built up sufficient combat power to take the city (Kharkiv) without diverting additional forces into the area.\"\nBut BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale, who is in the area, says it will be hard to dislodge the Russian forces in the region and that there are believed to be about 30,000 more troops just over the border.\nThe incursion is some miles from the main front line to the east where Russia has continued its offensive operations and been edging forwards since October 2023.\nThe MoD noted that Russian attacks intensified further in April - up 17% from March - with more than three quarters on the areas around...[Content truncated]",

Glide bombs can carry hundreds of kilograms of explosives and are dropped from aircraft which – in the case of attacks on the Kharkiv border region – do not even need to enter Ukrainian airspace.\nA Ukrainian National Guard Special Forces unit reported 20 such aerial attacks in one direction alone.\nMeanwhile, a few dozen kilometers to the east, Vovchansk remains a Russian focus, though it appears Ukraine has still managed to prevent a full Russian assault on the town.\n!\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz speaks during a press conference in Stockholm, Sweden, on May 14.\nSamuel Steen/TT News Agency/Reuters\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has appealed to European countries to do more to support Ukraine, saying he hoped they would provide Ukraine with “munition, artillery, tanks, and air defense, and especially Patriot \\”\nSpeaking in Stockholm on Tuesday, the German chancellor vowed support for Ukraine for as long as necessary.\nScholz said Germany’s announcement in April that it would send a third Patriot system to Ukraine had not been an easy decision as Germany did not have many...[Content truncated]",

Many people have sought refuge in neighbouring countries.\nThe latest data show 21,388,745 border crossings into Poland, 4,951,795 to Romania, 2,852,395 to Russia, 5,191,955 to Hungary, 2,471,670 to Slovakia, 1,142,655 to Moldova and 16,705 into Belarus. Most of those displaced have been women and children. Men aged 18 to 60 have been asked to remain in Ukraine to fight.\n\n \nBelow are ten infographics that break down the history, politics and economics of the Ukraine-Russia crisis.\nAfter months of tensions and intense diplomacy, Russian forces invaded Ukraine.

Below is a summary of the conflict at a glance.\nRussia and Ukraine were part of the 15 Soviet republics that made up the Soviet Union.

Russia’s defense ministry said it downed five “Ukrainian drones” near Moscow. Kyiv has not commented on the allegations.\n    \n\nRussia says it opposes renewal of Black Sea grain deal: The UN-brokered deal, which is set to expire on July 17, was established to provide “assistance to needy countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America,” but “has turned into a purely commercial export of Ukrainian food to ‘well-fed’ countries,” the Russian foreign ministry claimed in a statement. “It is obvious that there are no grounds for further continuation of the ‘Black Sea Initiative.’”\n    \n\nPutin attends virtual summit: President Vladimir Putin thanked allies who expressed solidarity with Russia after last month’s short-lived rebellion led by the Wagner private military company.

Other leaders taking part included China’s Xi Jinping, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko.\n    \n\nNATO chief gets extension: Ahead of a critical meeting of NATO leaders next week in Lithuania – expected to be dominated by Russia’s war in Ukraine – the alliance resolved one outstanding issue by extending the term of Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg for one more year. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the news while US President Joe Biden said it was an “important signal of stability” heading into the summit.\n    \n\n            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg held a phone call to coordinate their positions ahead of the alliance’s upcoming summit in Vilnius.\n    \nOn the eve of the NATO Summit in Vilnius on July 11-12, I had a phone call with @jensstoltenberg, the Secretary General of @NATO.I congratulated him on the decision of the Allies to extend his mandate as Secretary General for another year.

Even with a separatist conflict on the border, the future of Donetsk region looked bright, he said in a serious tone, but now, as tensions between Ukraine and Russia rise, it seems as though history might repeat itself.\n“I have already had the experience of having to leave my home,” he said.
