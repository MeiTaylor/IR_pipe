They have also made small gains in the village of Starytsia and have advanced closer to the village of Lyptsi to the west.\nRussia has intensified its attacks on the region following Friday's surprise incursions across the border, seizing several villages and settlements in one of the most significant ground attacks since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. \nVovchansk, located 74km (45 miles) from Kharkiv, has been heavily bombed in recent days. While it is a significant town in the region, Vovchansk is not of specific military importance, though its capture would be a blow to Ukrainian morale.\nHowever, Ukrainian officials say they are stabilising the situation and that the tempo of Russian operations in the area is decreasing.\nThousands of civilians have fled towards Kharkiv and there are concerns among Ukrainian commanders about what could happen if Russian troops get within artillery-range of the city.\nThe UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) assessment is that Russia is \"almost certainly attempting to divert Ukrainian resources away from other parts of the front line\", but adds: \"It is unlikely that Russia has built up sufficient combat power to take the city (Kharkiv) without diverting additional forces into the area.\"\nBut BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale, who is in the area, says it will be hard to dislodge the Russian forces in the region and that there are believed to be about 30,000 more troops just over the border.\nThe incursion is some miles from the main front line to the east where Russia has continued its offensive operations and been edging forwards since October 2023.\nThe MoD noted that Russian attacks intensified further in April - up 17% from March - with more than three quarters on the areas around...[Content truncated]",

By now, people have figured out how to navigate these risks: there is a state alert, and multiple Telegram channels indicating the levels of danger depending on the types of weapons involved. We all know it’s riskier to reside on the top floors, have large windows, or live in the neighbourhoods situated close to power substations.\nThe official alert app warning of air raids tells us, borrowing from Luke Skywalker: “Don’t be careless. Your overconfidence is your weakness.” Usually it’s not overconfidence that puts people at risk but exhaustion, after a string of sleepless nights forces you to snooze the air alert as if it were a regular alarm. Once you get an alert, you stay glued to your mobile phone, searching for which neighbourhood has been targeted. We’re forbidden from publishing the precise address of attacks until hours have passed; doing so could give the Russians the opportunity to make a more precise strike. So we message our relatives, colleagues and friends, hoping for the response: “It was far away. We’re in the shelter.”\nThe following day, unexpected sounds will startle you. But pursuing a normal working day after such a night is a matter of dignity. When Russia wants to destroy our way of life, living itself becomes an act of defiance. Ukrainians are the victims of Russian aggression, but being perceived as victims feels unpleasant, especially when you’re fighting back. These signs of resilience have perhaps made outsiders take for granted the efforts that Ukrainians are making to keep our state and society functioning. It takes all the running we can do simply to stand still.\nAcknowledging this collective exhaustion may seem like admitting weakness – as if our international audience expects Ukrainians to demonstrate their successes in their flawless fight against Goliath. Our country finds itself in an impossible position, where we are expected to show that we’re in control, while simultaneously making it clear how critical the situation is. Delays with weapons deliveries mean our armed forces are lacking ammunition. Foreign aid – financial, humanitarian, military – is essential right now.\n!\nAt Kyiv’s wall of remembrance friends embrace Liudmyla (left) whose son was killed fighting Russian troops.

Friedman\n!\nDestroyed Russian military equipment is exhibited in Kyiv at St. Michael’s Golden Domed Monastery.Credit...Emile Ducke for The New York Times\nWhile visiting Kyiv last week, my first trip to Ukraine since Vladimir Putin’s invasion in February 2022, I tried to get my exercise every morning by walking the grounds of St. Michael’s Golden Domed Monastery. Its serenity, though, has been disrupted by a jarring exhibit of destroyed Russian tanks and armored personnel carriers. During my walks, I’d poke my head into these jagged, rocket-pierced hulks, wondering what terrible death must have come to the Russian soldiers operating them.\nBut the shock of this tangled mass of rusting steel, sitting in the middle of this grand, whitish-stone piazza, evoked a different image in my mind’s eye: a meteor.\nIt looked as if a giant meteor had plummeted from space, disrupting life as we knew it — nearly eight decades without a “great power” war in Europe, a continent where centuries of invasions and conquest had given way to security and prosperity. Now we have this ugly pile sitting here in our midst, smoldering, and we, both Ukrainians and the world community, are struggling with how to deal with it.\nNearly every Ukrainian I spoke to in Kyiv was at once exhausted by the war and passionately determined to recover every inch of their Russian-occupied territory — but no one had clear answers about the road ahead, the painful trade-offs that await, only certainty that defeat would mean an end to Ukraine’s democratic dream and a smashing of the post-World War II era that had produced a Europe more whole and free than ever before in its history.\nWhat Putin is doing in Ukraine is not just reckless, not just a war of choice, not just an invasion in a class of its own for overreach, mendacity, immorality and incompetence, all wrapped in a farrago of lies. What he is doing is evil. He has trumped up any number of shifting justifications — one day it was removing a Nazi regime in power in Kyiv, the next it was preventing NATO expansion, the next it was fending off a Western cultural invasion of Russia — for what ultimately was a personal flight of fancy that now requires his superpower army turning to North Korea for help. It’s like the biggest bank in town having to ask the local pawnshop for a loan. So much for Putin’s bare-chested virility.\n* * *\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Your overconfidence is your weakness.” Usually it’s not overconfidence that puts people at risk but exhaustion, after a string of sleepless nights forces you to snooze the air alert as if it were a regular alarm. Once you get an alert, you stay glued to your mobile phone, searching for which neighbourhood has been targeted. We’re forbidden from publishing the precise address of attacks until hours have passed; doing so could give the Russians the opportunity to make a more precise strike. So we message our relatives, colleagues and friends, hoping for the response: “It was far away. We’re in the shelter.”\nThe following day, unexpected sounds will startle you. But pursuing a normal working day after such a night is a matter of dignity. When Russia wants to destroy our way of life, living itself becomes an act of defiance. Ukrainians are the victims of Russian aggression, but being perceived as victims feels unpleasant, especially when you’re fighting back. These signs of resilience have perhaps made outsiders take for granted the efforts that Ukrainians are making to keep our state and society functioning. It takes all the running we can do simply to stand still.\nAcknowledging this collective exhaustion may seem like admitting weakness – as if our international audience expects Ukrainians to demonstrate their successes in their flawless fight against Goliath. Our country finds itself in an impossible position, where we are expected to show that we’re in control, while simultaneously making it clear how critical the situation is. Delays with weapons deliveries mean our armed forces are lacking ammunition. Foreign aid – financial, humanitarian, military – is essential right now.\n!\nAt Kyiv’s wall of remembrance friends embrace Liudmyla (left) whose son was killed fighting Russian troops.

Western debates about the war with Russia can seem more emotional and dramatic than the discussions at...[Content truncated]"

Glide bombs can carry hundreds of kilograms of explosives and are dropped from aircraft which – in the case of attacks on the Kharkiv border region – do not even need to enter Ukrainian airspace.\nA Ukrainian National Guard Special Forces unit reported 20 such aerial attacks in one direction alone.\nMeanwhile, a few dozen kilometers to the east, Vovchansk remains a Russian focus, though it appears Ukraine has still managed to prevent a full Russian assault on the town.\n!\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz speaks during a press conference in Stockholm, Sweden, on May 14.\nSamuel Steen/TT News Agency/Reuters\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has appealed to European countries to do more to support Ukraine, saying he hoped they would provide Ukraine with “munition, artillery, tanks, and air defense, and especially Patriot \\”\nSpeaking in Stockholm on Tuesday, the German chancellor vowed support for Ukraine for as long as necessary.\nScholz said Germany’s announcement in April that it would send a third Patriot system to Ukraine had not been an easy decision as Germany did not have many...[Content truncated]"
