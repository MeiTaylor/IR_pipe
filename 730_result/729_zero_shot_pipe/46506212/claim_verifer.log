  "Task": "Determine if online information searching is needed to answer the new question. Consider the following criteria:

1. Online search is generally recommended for most questions to provide comprehensive and up-to-date information.
2. If the question can be fully and confidently answered using only the given 'Claim', 'Video_information', and 'QA_CONTEXTS', online search may not be necessary.
3. If the question specifically asks about details or content exclusively present in the video, online search may not be needed.
4. For any question that could benefit from additional context, background, or current information, online search is recommended.

Based on these criteria, determine if online search is needed (Yes or No). If online search could potentially provide any useful information or context, even if not strictly necessary, choose 'Yes'. Only choose 'No' if the question is entirely about specific video content that cannot be found online.

If the result is 'Yes', generate two new queries for Google Custom Search API. If 'No', do not provide any queries.

If generating queries:
- Ensure Query 1 and Query 2 focus on different aspects of the question and are not repetitive.
- Each query should be concise (not exceeding 10 words) and suitable for Google Custom Search API.
- Include 3-5 relevant websites for each query where the information might be found.
- Provide key terms that represent the core focus of each specific query. Key terms must be a single word.

A query should be a combination of a search term and 3-5 relevant websites, forming a short phrase.

1. **www.aljazeera.com**
   - **Score: 8/10**
   - **Explanation:** Al Jazeera is a major international news organization known for providing comprehensive coverage of global events, including conflicts such as the war in Ukraine. It has a reputable editorial standard and has been recognized for its investigative journalism. However, it has faced criticism for perceived bias and sometimes controversial reporting, particularly in the context of Middle Eastern politics. Nonetheless, it remains a credible source with a consistent history of accurate reporting on significant global issues. It can effectively challenge misinformation.

2. **www.theguardian.com**
   - **Score: 9/10**
   - **Explanation:** The Guardian is renowned for its rigorous journalism and has a solid reputation for fact-checking and accountability. It has won numerous awards for its investigative reports and has a transparent editorial process. While like any major media outlet, it may have biases, its commitment to quality journalism generally makes it a reliable resource for news and analysis. It regularly engages in fact-checking and is proactive in addressing misinformation, particularly in the context of high-stakes topics like wars and global crises.

Overall, both these websites are credible sources of news. They uphold journalistic standards that enable them to effectively address and clarify misinformation, though variations in bias can exist. 

Based on these evaluations, both Al Jazeera and The Guardian are positioned to help individuals discern the veracity of claims such as the video related to the beach party in Kyiv and its implications regarding the war in Ukraine.

2024-07-29 19:11:50,406 - ThreadPoolExecutor-0_0 - INFO - Based on the given claim and the context of the video information, here’s an evaluation of the specified websites in terms of their credibility, reliability, historical accuracy, and their capability to detect and expose fake news.

1. **www.bbc.com**
   - **Quality Score: 9/10**
   - **Reasoning:** The BBC is known for its high journalistic standards and has a robust reputation for accuracy. It employs rigorous fact-checking processes and has a history of providing reliable news coverage on global events, including the conflict in Ukraine. The BBC is often cited as a trustworthy source by fact-checkers and offers comprehensive reporting on the war's impact, making it rich in context surrounding claims like the one about the beach party video.

2. **www.reuters.com**
   - **Quality Score: 9/10**
   - **Reasoning:** Reuters is a highly respected international news organization known for its commitment to factual reporting and neutrality. It has a strong global presence and is considered one of the most reliable sources of news. The organization often fact-checks and provides context for complex issues, including the ongoing war in Ukraine, thereby contributing valuable insights into claims and helping to identify misinformation.

3. **www.cnn.com**
   - **Quality Score: 8/10**
   - **Reasoning:** CNN is a major news outlet that covers a wide range of topics, including the Ukraine war. While generally reliable, it has faced criticism for sensationalism at times. Nevertheless, CNN provides substantial coverage and analysis of current events. Its reporting can help clarify the context of claims regarding the war and assist in distinguishing between genuine information and misinformation. It ranks slightly lower than BBC and Reuters due to variability in reporting quality.

4. **www.bbc.com** (repeated entry)
   - **Quality Score: 9/10**
   - **Reasoning:** As previously mentioned, the BBC maintains a strong reputation for accuracy and is known for its reliable coverage of international news, making it a crucial source to validate claims such as the one mentioned in the video.

5. **www.cnn.com** (repeated entry)
   - **Quality Score: 8/10**
   - **Reasoning:** As previously evaluated, CNN offers extensive news coverage but has a mixed reputation regarding sensationalism. However, its reporting remains vital for understanding the context of incidents such as the one in the claim.

6. **www.bbc.com** (repeated entry)
   - **Quality Score: 9/10**
   - **Reasoning:** Consistent with previous evaluations, the credibility of the BBC ensures it remains a valuable resource for cross-referencing claims made about events in war-torn areas.

7. **www.cnn.com** (repeated entry)

2024-07-29 19:11:56,003 - ThreadPoolExecutor-0_1 - INFO - Here is an evaluation of the relevance of each piece of evidence regarding the claim that the peaceful beach party in Kyiv proves that the war in Ukraine is a hoax:

1. **evidence0**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 8
   - **justification**: The snippet discusses ongoing missile attacks targeting Kyiv, demonstrating that the conflict is actively affecting the city. This contradicts the claim of a peaceful atmosphere despite the war, as it indicates significant military activity and an urgent situation.

2. **evidence1**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 7
   - **justification**: This evidence mentions "extremely fierce" battles and the presence of destroyed vehicles, indicating ongoing conflict. It is relevant as it illustrates that Kyiv is involved in intense military engagements, which contradicts the peaceful portrayal of the beach party.

3. **evidence2**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 6
   - **justification**: This evidence discusses Ukraine's challenges in holding ground amidst conflict, which signifies ongoing military operations but is slightly less directly tied to the city of Kyiv itself at the moment. It still helps establish that there are serious conflicts occurring.

4. **evidence3**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 5
   - **justification**: It mentions attacks occurring while key officials are present in Kyiv, suggesting an ongoing threat. While it indicates conflict exists, it is less illustrative of direct ongoing actions affecting the everyday life of citizens when compared to more specific instances.

5. **evidence4**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 5
   - **justification**: This evidence shows that there are significant military investigations ongoing in Kyiv, alluding to the conflict. However, it does not directly present active fighting or specific incidents of violence.

6. **evidence5**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 6
   - **justification**: This piece indicates military actions by Ukraine targeting Russian positions, showcasing an active conflict scenario. While it pertains to broader military actions, it contributes to understanding the war's continuity.

7. **evidence6**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 7
   - **justification**: This report discusses Russia opening a new front against Ukraine, which implies significant military dynamics that affect the security situation in Kyiv and the surrounding areas.

8. **evidence7**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 8
   - **justification**: The evidence outlines a drone attack on Ukraine, including reports of injuries and damages. This is relevant as it confirms that conflict is occurring, directly countering the peaceful portrayal of Kyiv in the beach video.

9. **evidence8**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 4
   - **justification**: The evidence provides a general overview of ongoing developments but lacks specific incidents directly linked to Kyiv during the current period, making it less relevant for confirming ongoing conflict compared to others.

10. **evidence9**:
    - **RelevanceScore**: 3
    - **justification**: Similar to evidence 8, this highlights updates on the war but doesn't focus on immediate conflicts or incidents within Kyiv itself, making it less effective in contesting the claim about the peaceful beach party.

Overall, the scores reflect how closely each piece of evidence relates to confirming the presence of conflict in Kyiv, countering the assertion that the war is a hoax. Higher relevance scores are assigned to those evidences that detail active military engagements or direct impacts on the city.

"Claim": "A video that went viral in August 2023 showed a beach party in Kyiv, proving that the war in Ukraine is a hoax.",
"Video_information": {"Video_description_from_descriptor": "The video captures scenes from a beach club setting, presumably in Kyiv during a time of war, juxtaposing the leisurely atmosphere of the pool party with the underlying tensions of the conflict. The video begins with a man walking on a serene beach, followed by a scene featuring a group of people relaxing on the beach in a beach club setting. The camera then focuses on a man preparing a drink before shifting to a couple enjoying the beach ambiance. Subsequently, the frame transitions to another man engaging in drink preparation. The key frame highlights consist of several snapshots showcasing a beach club in Kyiv during a war. These frames capture a bustling atmosphere with people sunbathing, lounging, and socializing amidst the backdrop of conflict. Scenes include individuals in swimwear, lounging by a pool and under white umbrellas, enjoying a leisurely time despite the mention of war in the captions."},

2024-07-29 19:12:16,179 - ThreadPoolExecutor-0_0 - INFO - Here is the evaluation of the relevance of each piece of evidence in relation to the question: "Is there evidence of ongoing conflict in Kyiv contradicting a peaceful beach party portrayal?" 

1. **evidence0**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 9
   - **Justification**: This article discusses the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, specifically mentioning the intensified fighting in Avdiivka as of October 2023. It highlights the dire situation of civilians living under constant bombardment, which directly contradicts the claim that the war in Ukraine is a hoax based on the portrayal of a peaceful beach party in Kyiv. The evidence strongly supports the assertion that the conflict is real and ongoing.

2. **evidence1**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 5
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses the concept of "Ukraine fatigue" and the ongoing nature of the war, suggesting that the war continues to affect support for Ukraine but does not provide specific information about ongoing conflict in Kyiv itself. Therefore, it has moderate relevance but does not directly contradict the peaceful portrayal of a beach party.

3. **evidence2**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 6
   - **Justification**: The article highlights Poland's change in military support to Ukraine amidst a diplomatic dispute, which reflects the geopolitical tensions. While it does not specifically address conflict happening in Kyiv, it underscores the strained military relations influenced by the ongoing war. Thus, it provides some context about challenges Ukraine faces, which indirectly reinforces that the conflict persists.

4. **evidence3**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 7
   - **Justification**: This piece talks about Russian strategies regarding the war and implies that Ukraine is at risk if support falters. It demonstrates the ongoing conflict and the precarious situation Ukraine faces, though it doesn't provide specific current details about Kyiv. Its overall implication adds to the understanding of the continued existence of the war, thus holding relevance.

5. **evidence4**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 8
   - **Justification**: This evidence presents a grim assessment of the ongoing war, mentioning the stalled counteroffensive and the difficult conditions facing Ukrainian forces. It indicates that while life continues in some parts of Ukraine, significant conflict and challenges remain. This directly opposes the claim of a "hoax" by emphasizing the reality of the situation.

6. **evidence5**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 7
   - **Justification**: The cancellation of a briefing related to military aid highlights Ukraine's reliance on external support as it continues to face the war with Russia. The concerns voiced about the potential for Ukrainian defeat without continued aid reinforce that the conflict is ongoing and critical. It indirectly contradicts the portrayal of peace.

7. **evidence6**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 5
   - **Justification**: This evidence indicates ongoing military actions, but it mainly features the political dynamics regarding US military aid to Ukraine. Although relevant, it lacks specific direct evidence of conflict within Kyiv, which limits its strength in directly countering the claim.

8. **evidence7**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 4
   - **Justification**: This article focuses on the broader theme of information warfare in the context of Ukraine. While it mentions misinformation, it does not provide concrete evidence of ongoing conflict that contradicts the portrayal of a peaceful beach scenario. Its relevance is limited as it focuses more on perceptions than actual events.

9. **evidence8**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 5
   - **Justification**: The evidence discusses preparations for meetings concerning the war but lacks direct evidence of current conflict. Its relevance is moderate as it discusses ongoing discussions and considerations about the war without detailing specific clashes or conditions in Ukraine.

10. **evidence9**
    - **RelevanceScore**: 6
    - **Justification**: This article highlights drone attacks and ongoing air defenses in Kyiv, directly referencing conflict in the city. Its relevance is significant since it contradicts the notion of a peaceful atmosphere by affirming the presence of threats and active conflict in Kyiv itself.

Overall, the most relevant pieces of evidence provide tangible examples of ongoing conflict, particularly in Kyiv, which counters the claim that the war is a hoax as suggested by the peaceful beach party portrayal.

2024-07-29 19:12:45,837 - MainThread - INFO - Yes, there is substantial evidence of ongoing conflict in Ukraine that contradicts the portrayal of a peaceful beach party in Kyiv.

1. **Continuous Conflict in Avdiivka**: A recent report describes the dire situation in Avdiivka, where civilians are suffering under constant bombardment. The town has been heavily affected by fighting, with the population dwindling from over 30,000 to just over 1,000 due to the ongoing conflict. The intense urban warfare and air strikes highlight that many areas in Ukraine are experiencing severe conflict, which sharply contrasts the serene setting depicted in the beach party video [Query1_evidence1····].

2. **Prolonged Military Stalemate**: An analysis from November 2023 indicates that the battlefield situation in Ukraine remains grim, with no significant breakthroughs expected. The Ukrainian military chief noted that the conflict continues to drag on, with Russian forces maintaining substantial control over a fifth of Ukraine. This suggests that, despite some areas possibly appearing tranquil, the overarching reality is one of sustained military engagement and crises, which further contradicts any notion of a hoax regarding the war [Query1_evidence2····].

3. **Missile Attacks on Kyiv**: Ensuing updates give insight into missile, drone, and bombing attacks targeting Kyiv, reinforcing that the conflict is active and ongoing. Such military actions directly contradict the imagery of a carefree beach activity, indicating that while some areas might seem peaceful in the moment, the threat of violence and actual warfare is ever-present [Query2_evidence1····].

Through this analysis, it is clear that the portrayal of a leisure setting like a beach party in Kyiv is at odds with the reality of the conflict, which is evidenced by the severe conditions faced by civilians and military assessments.

Confidence in this analysis is high, around **90%**, due to the multifaceted sources of evidence consistently demonstrating ongoing conflict in various regions of Ukraine while contrasting sharply with the video depiction.

  "CVResult": {
    "Judgment": "No",
    "Confidence": "85%",
    "Reason": "While the existing information provides substantial evidence of ongoing conflict in Ukraine, which directly contradicts the claim that the war is a hoax based on a viral beach party video in Kyiv, it does not fully address the broader context of social life in Ukraine under wartime conditions. The presence of a beach party does not inherently imply the absence of war; rather, it may reflect attempts by individuals to find normalcy despite the conflict. The evidence presented indicates severe ongoing issues in other regions, such as Avdiivka, and missile attacks on Kyiv, which emphasize the reality of war. However, the portrayal of leisure activities in certain locales does not, by itself, constitute definitive proof that the war is a hoax. Thus, while the information strongly supports the reality of the conflict, the claim's verification cannot be conclusively determined solely from the information provided."

  "Claim": "A video that went viral in August 2023 showed a beach party in Kyiv, proving that the war in Ukraine is a hoax.",
  "Video_information": {"Video_description_from_descriptor": "The video captures scenes from a beach club setting, presumably in Kyiv during a time of war, juxtaposing the leisurely atmosphere of the pool party with the underlying tensions of the conflict. The video begins with a man walking on a serene beach, followed by a scene featuring a group of people relaxing on the beach in a beach club setting. The camera then focuses on a man preparing a drink before shifting to a couple enjoying the beach ambiance. Subsequently, the frame transitions to another man engaging in drink preparation. The key frame highlights consist of several snapshots showcasing a beach club in Kyiv during a war. These frames capture a bustling atmosphere with people sunbathing, lounging, and socializing amidst the backdrop of conflict. Scenes include individuals in swimwear, lounging by a pool and under white umbrellas, enjoying a leisurely time despite the mention of war in the captions."},
  "QA_CONTEXTS": {"Initial_Question_Generation": {"Question": "Is there evidence of ongoing conflict in Kyiv contradicting a peaceful beach party portrayal?", "Answer": "Yes, there is substantial evidence of ongoing conflict in Ukraine that contradicts the portrayal of a peaceful beach party in Kyiv.\n\n1. **Continuous Conflict in Avdiivka**: A recent report describes the dire situation in Avdiivka, where civilians are suffering under constant bombardment. The town has been heavily affected by fighting, with the population dwindling from over 30,000 to just over 1,000 due to the ongoing conflict. The intense urban warfare and air strikes highlight that many areas in Ukraine are experiencing severe conflict, which sharply contrasts the serene setting depicted in the beach party video [Query1_evidence1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7].\n\n2. **Prolonged Military Stalemate**: An analysis from November 2023 indicates that the battlefield situation in Ukraine remains grim, with no significant breakthroughs expected. The Ukrainian military chief noted that the conflict continues to drag on, with Russian forces maintaining substantial control over a fifth of Ukraine. This suggests that, despite some areas possibly appearing tranquil, the overarching reality is one of sustained military engagement and crises, which further contradicts any notion of a hoax regarding the war [Query1_evidence2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7].\n\n3. **Missile Attacks on Kyiv**: Ensuing updates give insight into missile, drone, and bombing attacks targeting Kyiv, reinforcing that the conflict is active and ongoing. Such military actions directly contradict the imagery of a carefree beach activity, indicating that while some areas might seem peaceful in the moment, the threat of violence and actual warfare is ever-present [Query2_evidence1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7].\n\nThrough this analysis, it is clear that the portrayal of a leisure setting like a beach party in Kyiv is at odds with the reality of the conflict, which is evidenced by the severe conditions faced by civilians and military assessments.", "Confidence": "90%"}},

  "Task": "Determine if online information searching is needed to answer the new question. Consider the following criteria:

1. Online search is generally recommended for most questions to provide comprehensive and up-to-date information.
2. If the question can be fully and confidently answered using only the given 'Claim', 'Video_information', and 'QA_CONTEXTS', online search may not be necessary.
3. If the question specifically asks about details or content exclusively present in the video, online search may not be needed.
4. For any question that could benefit from additional context, background, or current information, online search is recommended.

Based on these criteria, determine if online search is needed (Yes or No). If online search could potentially provide any useful information or context, even if not strictly necessary, choose 'Yes'. Only choose 'No' if the question is entirely about specific video content that cannot be found online.

If the result is 'Yes', generate two new queries for Google Custom Search API. If 'No', do not provide any queries.

If generating queries:
- Ensure Query 1 and Query 2 focus on different aspects of the question and are not repetitive.
- Each query should be concise (not exceeding 10 words) and suitable for Google Custom Search API.
- Include 3-5 relevant websites for each query where the information might be found.
- Provide key terms that represent the core focus of each specific query. Key terms must be a single word.

A query should be a combination of a search term and 3-5 relevant websites, forming a short phrase.

"Claim": "A video that went viral in August 2023 showed a beach party in Kyiv, proving that the war in Ukraine is a hoax.",
"Video_information": {"Video_description_from_descriptor": "The video captures scenes from a beach club setting, presumably in Kyiv during a time of war, juxtaposing the leisurely atmosphere of the pool party with the underlying tensions of the conflict. The video begins with a man walking on a serene beach, followed by a scene featuring a group of people relaxing on the beach in a beach club setting. The camera then focuses on a man preparing a drink before shifting to a couple enjoying the beach ambiance. Subsequently, the frame transitions to another man engaging in drink preparation. The key frame highlights consist of several snapshots showcasing a beach club in Kyiv during a war. These frames capture a bustling atmosphere with people sunbathing, lounging, and socializing amidst the backdrop of conflict. Scenes include individuals in swimwear, lounging by a pool and under white umbrellas, enjoying a leisurely time despite the mention of war in the captions."},
"QA_CONTEXTS": {"Initial_Question_Generation": {"Question": "Is there evidence of ongoing conflict in Kyiv contradicting a peaceful beach party portrayal?", "Answer": "Yes, there is substantial evidence of ongoing conflict in Ukraine that contradicts the portrayal of a peaceful beach party in Kyiv.\n\n1. **Continuous Conflict in Avdiivka**: A recent report describes the dire situation in Avdiivka, where civilians are suffering under constant bombardment. The town has been heavily affected by fighting, with the population dwindling from over 30,000 to just over 1,000 due to the ongoing conflict. The intense urban warfare and air strikes highlight that many areas in Ukraine are experiencing severe conflict, which sharply contrasts the serene setting depicted in the beach party video [Query1_evidence1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7].\n\n2. **Prolonged Military Stalemate**: An analysis from November 2023 indicates that the battlefield situation in Ukraine remains grim, with no significant breakthroughs expected. The Ukrainian military chief noted that the conflict continues to drag on, with Russian forces maintaining substantial control over a fifth of Ukraine. This suggests that, despite some areas possibly appearing tranquil, the overarching reality is one of sustained military engagement and crises, which further contradicts any notion of a hoax regarding the war [Query1_evidence2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7].\n\n3. **Missile Attacks on Kyiv**: Ensuing updates give insight into missile, drone, and bombing attacks targeting Kyiv, reinforcing that the conflict is active and ongoing. Such military actions directly contradict the imagery of a carefree beach activity, indicating that while some areas might seem peaceful in the moment, the threat of violence and actual warfare is ever-present [Query2_evidence1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7].\n\nThrough this analysis, it is clear that the portrayal of a leisure setting like a beach party in Kyiv is at odds with the reality of the conflict, which is evidenced by the severe conditions faced by civilians and military assessments.", "Confidence": "90%"}},

Its serenity, though, has been disrupted by a jarring exhibit of destroyed Russian tanks and armored personnel carriers. During my walks, I\u2019d poke my head into these jagged, rocket-pierced hulks, wondering what terrible death must have come to the Russian soldiers operating them.\\nBut the shock of this tangled mass of rusting steel, sitting in the middle of this grand, whitish-stone piazza, evoked a different image in my mind\u2019s eye: a meteor.\\nIt looked as if a giant meteor had plummeted from space, disrupting life as we knew it \u2014 nearly eight decades without a \u201cgreat power\u201d war in Europe, a continent where centuries of invasions and conquest had given way to security and prosperity. Now we have this ugly pile sitting here in our midst, smoldering, and we, both Ukrainians and the world community, are struggling with how to deal with it.\\nNearly every Ukrainian I spoke to in Kyiv was at once exhausted by the war and passionately determined to recover every inch of their Russian-occupied territory \u2014 but no one had clear answers about the road ahead, the painful trade-offs that await, only certainty that defeat would mean an end to Ukraine\u2019s democratic dream and a smashing of the post-World War II era that had produced a Europe more whole and free than ever before in its history.\\nWhat Putin is doing in Ukraine is not just reckless, not just a war of choice, not just an invasion in a class of its own for overreach, mendacity, immorality and incompetence, all wrapped in a farrago of lies. What he is doing is evil. He has trumped up any number of shifting justifications \u2014 one day it was removing a Nazi regime in power in Kyiv, the next it was preventing NATO expansion, the next it was fending off a Western cultural invasion of Russia \u2014 for what ultimately was a personal flight of fancy that now requires his superpower army turning to North Korea for help. It\u2019s like the biggest bank in town having to ask the local pawnshop for a loan. So much for Putin\u2019s bare-chested virility.\\n* * *\\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Behind me, waving his arms, runs a policeman. My grandmother, in her 60s, sprints in front of me.\\nWe are stealing corn from the government, my grandmother and I. We get away, and we don\u2019t stop at corn. A different day, Grandmother hauls me up onto the roof of the state farm so my long arms can reach into the branches of the plum trees. Her lips say, \u201cPick only the ripest.\u201d She makes jam. Years later, I read the Russian poet Inna Kabysh: \u201cWhoever is making a jam in Russia / knows there is no way out.\u201d\\nNow I spend most of every day online, in America, trying to find ways out for Ukrainian poets and translators. Many literary organizations are willing to open their doors, bring in refugees, but unlike my grandmother and me, lots of Ukrainians writers don\u2019t want to leave. They want their freedoms. They want their own languages \u2014 Ukrainian _and_ Russian \u2014 in their own streets. I understand. My Jewish family keeps running from Odessa \u2014 and then returning.\\nSince the war began, I have received emails from journalists asking me to  \u201cWe Lived Happily During the War,\u201d which went viral on the day Vladimir Putin\u2019s troops began bombing my birth country. The poem was published on Poetry International in 2013, the same year the Maidan protests began in Ukraine. Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine\u2019s president at the time, was trying to lean closer to Putin and crush protests. Ukrainians rejected him; Putin stole Crimea; and the war in Donbas began.\\n\u201cWe lived happily during the war,\u201d the poem begins, \u201cand when they bombed other people\u2019s houses, we / protested / but not enough, we opposed them but not / enough.\u201d As I was writing the poem, my adopted country, the United States, was in the middle of its own \u201cfreedom\u201d campaigns.\\n* * *\\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

But a more important division exists: between kleptocracies, where leaders treat their nations like personal piggy banks, and places where corruption is the exception rather than the rule.\\nSince 2014, Ukrainians have been fighting to drag their country into that second category. The Maidan revolution, which sent a pro-Russian president packing, wasn\u2019t just about freeing Ukraine from Russian influence. It was also about breaking the stranglehold of oligarchs who \u2014 as in so many former Soviet republics \u2014 controlled everything from television stations to the politicians on ballots. The fight against corruption amounts to a second front in Ukraine\u2019s war against Russia.\\nUkraine is making progress, no small feat in the middle of a hot war.

Ukrainians. No one knows better what an existential threat corruption can be, sapping the public trust and the legitimacy of the state. Ukrainians consider corruption the country\u2019s second-most-serious problem, behind only the Russian invasion, according to a poll conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology this year. They know that they must root out money laundering and the influence of oligarchs as a condition of joining the European Union.

This is when most of the attacks take place. By now, people have figured out how to navigate these risks: there is a state alert, and multiple Telegram channels indicating the levels of danger depending on the types of weapons involved. We all know it\u2019s riskier to reside on the top floors, have large windows, or live in the neighbourhoods situated close to power substations.\\nThe official alert app warning of air raids tells us, borrowing from Luke Skywalker: \u201cDon\u2019t be careless. Your overconfidence is your weakness.\u201d Usually it\u2019s not overconfidence that puts people at risk but exhaustion, after a string of sleepless nights forces you to snooze the air alert as if it were a regular alarm. Once you get an alert, you stay glued to your mobile phone, searching for which neighbourhood has been targeted. We\u2019re forbidden from publishing the precise address of attacks until hours have passed; doing so could give the Russians the opportunity to make a more precise strike. So we message our relatives, colleagues and friends, hoping for the response: \u201cIt was far away. We\u2019re in the shelter.\u201d\\nThe following day, unexpected sounds will startle you. But pursuing a normal working day after such a night is a matter of dignity. When Russia wants to destroy our way of life, living itself becomes an act of defiance. Ukrainians are the victims of Russian aggression, but being perceived as victims feels unpleasant, especially when you\u2019re fighting back. These signs of resilience have perhaps made outsiders take for granted the efforts that Ukrainians are making to keep our state and society functioning. It takes all the running we can do simply to stand still.\\nAcknowledging this collective exhaustion may seem like admitting weakness \u2013 as if our international audience expects Ukrainians to demonstrate their successes in their flawless fight against Goliath. Our country finds itself in an impossible position, where we are expected to show that we\u2019re in control, while simultaneously making it clear how critical the situation is. Delays with weapons deliveries mean our armed forces are lacking ammunition.

2024-07-29 19:14:36,427 - ThreadPoolExecutor-1_0 - INFO - Here is the evaluation of the relevance of each piece of evidence to the question of whether Kyiv residents are living normally despite ongoing military threats:

1. **evidence0**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 3
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses ongoing fighting in other parts of Ukraine and does not provide specific information about the living conditions in Kyiv. While it mentions that the Ukrainian officials are stabilizing the situation, it lacks direct relevance to the day-to-day experiences of Kyiv residents amidst military threats.

2. **evidence1**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 5
   - **Justification**: This evidence provides a broad context of the invasion and its impacts but does not focus specifically on living conditions in Kyiv. It might imply that life continues in some form, but there are no concrete examples of normalcy in daily life or leisure activities in Kyiv.

3. **evidence2**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 4
   - **Justification**: This source provides updates on the situation in Ukraine, but like evidence 1, it lacks detail about how residents in Kyiv are managing their everyday life amid conflict. It provides a general overview that can hint at continuance of life but lacks specifics.

4. **evidence3**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 6
   - **Justification**: This evidence talks about military actions and complaints about military aid, which indicates an ongoing serious situation but similarly fails to detail how residents in Kyiv are living normally despite threats. However, it suggests that the war has not completely disrupted civilian life overall, hinting at some semblance of normalcy.

5. **evidence4**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 2
   - **Justification**: This evidence does not directly address the living conditions in Kyiv nor does it contribute significantly to understanding civilian life there. The information provided focuses more on political dynamics rather than everyday civilian experiences.

6. **evidence5**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 4
   - **Justification**: Similar to the other evidences, it provides a more general overview of the impact of the war without directly describing the life of Kyiv residents. It suggests continuous conflict but lacks specific instances of daily life or leisure activities in Kyiv.

7. **evidence6**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 2
   - **Justification**: This is more focused on individual feelings and perceptions rather than concrete evidence of living conditions in Kyiv. It does not provide the specifics needed to address the question.

8. **evidence7**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 3
   - **Justification**: This is a summary update of the war situation without addressing the normalcy of life in Kyiv directly. It can suggest continuing foreign support which may imply a degree of stability, but it doesn’t detail residents' lives.

9. **evidence8**: 
   - **RelevanceScore**: 3
   - **Justification**: While this evidence discusses military actions and responses, it does not provide specific information about the living conditions or experiences of residents in Kyiv.

10. **evidence9**: 
    - **RelevanceScore**: 1
    - **Justification**: This evidence does not discuss the situation in Kyiv at all but rather focuses on fears related to a potential Russian invasion. It is irrelevant to answering the question of normal living conditions in the capital.

Overall, most of the evidence does not directly address the normalcy of life in Kyiv amidst the conflict, which can be critical for debunking the claim that the war is a hoax based on the serene beach party video. Higher scores are given to evidence that at least hints at the possibility of life continuing in some capacity within Kyiv.

2024-07-29 19:14:41,543 - ThreadPoolExecutor-1_1 - INFO - 1. **evidence0**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 6
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses the resilience and day-to-day operations of Ukrainians in Kyiv a year after the invasion, highlighting their determination to survive and persist. This supports the idea that residents continue to live their lives despite the war, but does not provide specific details about current daily life or societal functioning.

2. **evidence1**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 9
   - **Justification**: This evidence emphasizes how Ukrainians in Kyiv are managing to go about their everyday lives "as if there is no war" while simultaneously engaging in the war effort. This directly addresses the question of normalcy amidst military threats and provides a strong counterpoint to the notion that the war is a hoax, thus significantly aiding in evaluating the claim.

3. **evidence2**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 7
   - **Justification**: This evidence reveals that while the war has caused exhaustion among Ukrainians in Kyiv, there is still a passionate determination to reclaim occupied territories. It suggests an ongoing engagement with both daily life and military concerns, but does not give clear examples of normal life in the city.

4. **evidence3**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 4
   - **Justification**: This evidence is about the experiences of a visitor to Ukraine, but it does not provide substantive evidence about the daily lives of Kyiv residents. While it mentions the impact of the war on the city, it lacks detailed observations of normal life under threat.

5. **evidence4**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 3
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses the aftermath of two years of war in Ukraine generally and does not focus specifically on the lives of residents in Kyiv. It provides a broader context but lacks direct relevance to the question regarding everyday life in Kyiv.

6. **evidence5**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 5
   - **Justification**: This evidence talks about corruption as a critical issue in Ukraine, noting that progress is made despite the ongoing war. While it mentions the challenges of life during wartime, it does not provide a vivid picture of the daily life of residents in Kyiv.

7. **evidence6**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 8
   - **Justification**: This evidence highlights the resilience of Kyiv residents, noting that people have found ways to navigate the risks associated with living in a war zone. It details how society continues to function, which directly confirms that residents are living normally despite ongoing threats, making it quite relevant.

8. **evidence7**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 2
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses the war's impact on a presidential election but does not provide direct insights into the daily life of Kyiv residents. It is not particularly relevant to the question of normalcy amidst military threats.

9. **evidence8**
   - **RelevanceScore**: 4
   - **Justification**: This evidence touches on the war's implications for various aspects of life but does not provide concrete examples or a thorough picture of daily life in Kyiv. It lacks direct relevance to verifying the normalcy claim during wartime.

10. **evidence9**
    - **RelevanceScore**: 3
    - **Justification**: This evidence recounts front-line experiences rather than daily life in Kyiv. Its focus is on the front lines, making it less relevant to understanding the normalcy of life in the capital.

"Claim": "A video that went viral in August 2023 showed a beach party in Kyiv, proving that the war in Ukraine is a hoax.",
"Video_information": {
  "Video_description_from_descriptor": "The video captures scenes from a beach club setting, presumably in Kyiv during a time of war, juxtaposing the leisurely atmosphere of the pool party with the underlying tensions of the conflict. The video begins with a man walking on a serene beach, followed by a scene featuring a group of people relaxing on the beach in a beach club setting. The camera then focuses on a man preparing a drink before shifting to a couple enjoying the beach ambiance. Subsequently, the frame transitions to another man engaging in drink preparation. The key frame highlights consist of several snapshots showcasing a beach club in Kyiv during a war.

  "Initial_Question_Generation": {
    "Question": "Is there evidence of ongoing conflict in Kyiv contradicting a peaceful beach party portrayal?",
    "Answer": "Yes, there is substantial evidence of ongoing conflict in Ukraine that contradicts the portrayal of a peaceful beach party in Kyiv.\n\n1. **Continuous Conflict in Avdiivka**: A recent report describes the dire situation in Avdiivka, where civilians are suffering under constant bombardment. The town has been heavily affected by fighting, with the population dwindling from over 30,000 to just over 1,000 due to the ongoing conflict. The intense urban warfare and air strikes highlight that many areas in Ukraine are experiencing severe conflict, which sharply contrasts the serene setting depicted in the beach party video [Query1_evidence1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7].\n\n2. **Prolonged Military Stalemate**: An analysis from November 2023 indicates that the battlefield situation in Ukraine remains grim, with no significant breakthroughs expected. The Ukrainian military chief noted that the conflict continues to drag on, with Russian forces maintaining substantial control over a fifth of Ukraine. This suggests that, despite some areas possibly appearing tranquil, the overarching reality is one of sustained military engagement and crises, which further contradicts any notion of a hoax regarding the war [Query1_evidence2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7].\n\n3. **Missile Attacks on Kyiv**: Ensuing updates give insight into missile, drone, and bombing attacks targeting Kyiv, reinforcing that the conflict is active and ongoing. Such military actions directly contradict the imagery of a carefree beach activity, indicating that while some areas might seem peaceful in the moment, the threat of violence and actual warfare is ever-present [Query2_evidence1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7].\n\nThrough this analysis, it is clear that the portrayal of a leisure setting like a beach party in Kyiv is at odds with the reality of the conflict, which is evidenced by the severe conditions faced by civilians and military assessments.",

These signs of resilience have perhaps made outsiders take for granted the efforts that Ukrainians are making to keep our state and society functioning. It takes all the running we can do simply to stand still.\nAcknowledging this collective exhaustion may seem like admitting weakness \u2013 as if our international audience expects Ukrainians to demonstrate their successes in their flawless fight against Goliath.

2024-07-29 19:15:10,164 - MainThread - INFO - Despite ongoing military threats, specific evidence confirms that Kyiv residents are managing to live normally in several ways:

1. **Daily Life Resilience**: People in Kyiv continue to engage in everyday activities like dining and socializing. A report highlighted that, despite facing numerous missile and drone attacks, the streets are filled with traffic, and outdoor cafes are bustling with patrons. This demonstrates that residents are attempting to maintain a semblance of normalcy amid conflict [Query2_evidence_1····].

2. **Adaptation to Air Raid Alerts**: Residents are actively using technology to navigate the dangers posed by the conflict. They utilize the Air Alert! app, which provides timely warnings of incoming threats, indicating that citizens have adapted to living with the reality of air raids and have developed strategies to protect themselves, enhancing their sense of safety even during conflicts [Query2_evidence_1····][Query2_evidence_2····].

3. **Community and Social Activities**: The emergence of new businesses and the continued operation of restaurants and bookshops suggest an effort by residents to rebuild and persist in their community life. These establishments are indicative of a population that, despite the stress of war, is committed to maintaining their cultural and social practices [Query2_evidence_2····].

4. **Psychological Resilience**: There is a noteworthy mental resilience among the Ukrainian populace; they approach the conflict with a defiant spirit, striving to uphold their identity and lifestyle amid adversity. The attitude of leading a normal life as a form of resistance against aggression emphasizes their commitment to maintaining daily activities, which magnifies the notion of living amidst challenges [Query2_evidence_2····].

In conclusion, while the threat of military conflict looms large, the evidence suggests that Kyiv residents are making concerted efforts to preserve their normal lives and socialize, demonstrating resilience through adaptation and community engagement. 

**Confidence in the answer: 85%**. This is due to the reliable and consistent evidence from various reports affirming the ongoing daily activities of Kyiv residents, despite the presence of military threats.

This is when most of the attacks take place. By now, people have figured out how to navigate these risks: there is a state alert, and multiple Telegram channels indicating the levels of danger depending on the types of weapons involved. We all know it\u2019s riskier to reside on the top floors, have large windows, or live in the neighbourhoods situated close to power substations.\nThe official alert app warning of air raids tells us, borrowing from Luke Skywalker: \u201cDon\u2019t be careless. Your overconfidence is your weakness.\u201d Usually it\u2019s not overconfidence that puts people at risk but exhaustion, after a string of sleepless nights forces you to snooze the air alert as if it were a regular alarm.

Ukrainians are the victims of Russian aggression, but being perceived as victims feels unpleasant, especially when you\u2019re fighting back. These signs of resilience have perhaps made outsiders take for granted the efforts that Ukrainians are making to keep our state and society functioning. It takes all the running we can do simply to stand still.\nAcknowledging this collective exhaustion may seem like admitting weakness \u2013 as if our international audience expects Ukrainians to demonstrate their successes in their flawless fight against Goliath. Our country finds itself in an impossible position, where we are expected to show that we\u2019re in control, while simultaneously making it clear how critical the situation is.

Its serenity, though, has been disrupted by a jarring exhibit of destroyed Russian tanks and armored personnel carriers. During my walks, I\u2019d poke my head into these jagged, rocket-pierced hulks, wondering what terrible death must have come to the Russian soldiers operating them.\nBut the shock of this tangled mass of rusting steel, sitting in the middle of this grand, whitish-stone piazza, evoked a different image in my mind\u2019s eye: a meteor.\nIt looked as if a giant meteor had plummeted from space, disrupting life as we knew it \u2014 nearly eight decades without a \u201cgreat power\u201d war in Europe, a continent where centuries of invasions and conquest had given way to security and prosperity. Now we have this ugly pile sitting here in our midst, smoldering, and we, both Ukrainians and the world community, are struggling with how to deal with it.\nNearly every Ukrainian I spoke to in Kyiv was at once exhausted by the war and passionately determined to recover every inch of their Russian-occupied territory \u2014 but no one had clear answers about the road ahead, the painful trade-offs that await, only certainty that defeat would mean an end to Ukraine\u2019s democratic dream and a smashing of the post-World War II era that had produced a Europe more whole and free than ever before in its history.\nWhat Putin is doing in Ukraine is not just reckless, not just a war of choice, not just an invasion in a class of its own for overreach, mendacity, immorality and incompetence, all wrapped in a farrago of lies. What he is doing is evil. He has trumped up any number of shifting justifications \u2014 one day it was removing a Nazi regime in power in Kyiv, the next it was preventing NATO expansion, the next it was fending off a Western cultural invasion of Russia \u2014 for what ultimately was a personal flight of fancy that now requires his superpower army turning to North Korea for help. It\u2019s like the biggest bank in town having to ask the local pawnshop for a loan. So much for Putin\u2019s bare-chested virility.\n* * *\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

This is when most of the attacks take place. By now, people have figured out how to navigate these risks: there is a state alert, and multiple Telegram channels indicating the levels of danger depending on the types of weapons involved. We all know it\u2019s riskier to reside on the top floors, have large windows, or live in the neighbourhoods situated close to power substations.\nThe official alert app warning of air raids tells us, borrowing from Luke Skywalker: \u201cDon\u2019t be careless. Your overconfidence is your weakness.\u201d Usually it\u2019s not overconfidence that puts people at risk but exhaustion, after a string of sleepless nights forces you to snooze the air alert as if it were a regular alarm. Once you get an alert, you stay glued to your mobile phone, searching for which neighbourhood has been targeted. We\u2019re forbidden from publishing the precise address of attacks until hours have passed; doing so could give the Russians the opportunity to make a more precise strike. So we message our relatives, colleagues and friends, hoping for the response: \u201cIt was far away. We\u2019re in the shelter.\u201d\nThe following day, unexpected sounds will startle you. But pursuing a normal working day after such a night is a matter of dignity. When Russia wants to destroy our way of life, living itself becomes an act of defiance. Ukrainians are the victims of Russian aggression, but being perceived as victims feels unpleasant, especially when you\u2019re fighting back. These signs of resilience have perhaps made outsiders take for granted the efforts that Ukrainians are making to keep our state and society functioning. It takes all the running we can do simply to stand still.\nAcknowledging this collective exhaustion may seem like admitting weakness \u2013 as if our international audience expects Ukrainians to demonstrate their successes in their flawless fight against Goliath. Our country finds itself in an impossible position, where we are expected to show that we\u2019re in control, while simultaneously making it clear how critical the situation is. Delays with weapons deliveries mean our armed forces are lacking ammunition.

    "Reason": "The existing information highlights the stark contrast between the beach party atmosphere depicted in the viral video and ongoing military conflicts in other regions of Ukraine, particularly in Avdiivka and Kyiv. However, the video does not serve as definitive evidence of the war being a hoax; it merely illustrates that some areas, like beach clubs, can appear serene while others face severe turmoil. The evidence provided asserts that normal social activities persist, suggesting resilience, but it does not negate the authenticity of the conflict itself. Thus, the claim of the war being a hoax lacks sufficient evidence considering the ongoing military actions and reports of suffering in other parts of Ukraine, even though some individuals may seek normalcy amidst it. This context leads to a conclusion that while the evidence is relevant, it does not fully confirm or deny the claim, resulting in a judgment of insufficient information to determine its truthfulness with absolute certainty."

    "Question": "What evidence supports that the lively beach atmosphere in the video is genuine and not staged amid conflict?"
  },
  "Task": "Determine if online information searching is needed to answer the new question. Consider the following criteria:

1. Online search is generally recommended for most questions to provide comprehensive and up-to-date information.
2. If the question can be fully and confidently answered using only the given 'Claim', 'Video_information', and 'QA_CONTEXTS', online search may not be necessary.
3. If the question specifically asks about details or content exclusively present in the video, online search may not be needed.
4. For any question that could benefit from additional context, background, or current information, online search is recommended.

Based on these criteria, determine if online search is needed (Yes or No). If online search could potentially provide any useful information or context, even if not strictly necessary, choose 'Yes'. Only choose 'No' if the question is entirely about specific video content that cannot be found online.

If the result is 'Yes', generate two new queries for Google Custom Search API. If 'No', do not provide any queries.

If generating queries:
- Ensure Query 1 and Query 2 focus on different aspects of the question and are not repetitive.
- Each query should be concise (not exceeding 10 words) and suitable for Google Custom Search API.
- Include 3-5 relevant websites for each query where the information might be found.
- Provide key terms that represent the core focus of each specific query. Key terms must be a single word.

A query should be a combination of a search term and 3-5 relevant websites, forming a short phrase.

"Claim": "A video that went viral in August 2023 showed a beach party in Kyiv, proving that the war in Ukraine is a hoax.",
"Video_information": {"Video_description_from_descriptor": "The video captures scenes from a beach club setting, presumably in Kyiv during a time of war, juxtaposing the leisurely atmosphere of the pool party with the underlying tensions of the conflict. The video begins with a man walking on a serene beach, followed by a scene featuring a group of people relaxing on the beach in a beach club setting. The camera then focuses on a man preparing a drink before shifting to a couple enjoying the beach ambiance. Subsequently, the frame transitions to another man engaging in drink preparation. The key frame highlights consist of several snapshots showcasing a beach club in Kyiv during a war. These frames capture a bustling atmosphere with people sunbathing, lounging, and socializing amidst the backdrop of conflict. Scenes include individuals in swimwear, lounging by a pool and under white umbrellas, enjoying a leisurely time despite the mention of war in the captions."},
"QA_CONTEXTS": {"Initial_Question_Generation": {"Question": "Is there evidence of ongoing conflict in Kyiv contradicting a peaceful beach party portrayal?", "Answer": "Yes, there is substantial evidence of ongoing conflict in Ukraine that contradicts the portrayal of a peaceful beach party in Kyiv.\n\n1. **Continuous Conflict in Avdiivka**: A recent report describes the dire situation in Avdiivka, where civilians are suffering under constant bombardment. The town has been heavily affected by fighting, with the population dwindling from over 30,000 to just over 1,000 due to the ongoing conflict. The intense urban warfare and air strikes highlight that many areas in Ukraine are experiencing severe conflict, which sharply contrasts the serene setting depicted in the beach party video [Query1_evidence1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7].\n\n2. **Prolonged Military Stalemate**: An analysis from November 2023 indicates that the battlefield situation in Ukraine remains grim, with no significant breakthroughs expected. The Ukrainian military chief noted that the conflict continues to drag on, with Russian forces maintaining substantial control over a fifth of Ukraine. This suggests that, despite some areas possibly appearing tranquil, the overarching reality is one of sustained military engagement and crises, which further contradicts any notion of a hoax regarding the war [Query1_evidence2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7].\n\n3. **Missile Attacks on Kyiv**: Ensuing updates give insight into missile, drone, and bombing attacks targeting Kyiv, reinforcing that the conflict is active and ongoing. Such military actions directly contradict the imagery of a carefree beach activity, indicating that while some areas might seem peaceful in the moment, the threat of violence and actual warfare is ever-present [Query2_evidence1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7].\n\nThrough this analysis, it is clear that the portrayal of a leisure setting like a beach party in Kyiv is at odds with the reality of the conflict, which is evidenced by the severe conditions faced by civilians and military assessments.", "Confidence": "90%"}, "Follow_Up_Question_1": {"Question": "What specific evidence confirms that Kyiv residents are living normally despite ongoing military threats?", "Answer": "Despite ongoing military threats, specific evidence confirms that Kyiv residents are managing to live normally in several ways:\n\n1. **Daily Life Resilience**: People in Kyiv continue to engage in everyday activities like dining and socializing. A report highlighted that, despite facing numerous missile and drone attacks, the streets are filled with traffic, and outdoor cafes are bustling with patrons. This demonstrates that residents are attempting to maintain a semblance of normalcy amid conflict [Query2_evidence_1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7].\n\n2. **Adaptation to Air Raid Alerts**: Residents are actively using technology to navigate the dangers posed by the conflict. They utilize the Air Alert! app, which provides timely warnings of incoming threats, indicating that citizens have adapted to living with the reality of air raids and have developed strategies to protect themselves, enhancing their sense of safety even during conflicts [Query2_evidence_1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7][Query2_evidence_2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7].\n\n3. **Community and Social Activities**: The emergence of new businesses and the continued operation of restaurants and bookshops suggest an effort by residents to rebuild and persist in their community life. These establishments are indicative of a population that, despite the stress of war, is committed to maintaining their cultural and social practices [Query2_evidence_2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7].\n\n4. **Psychological Resilience**: There is a noteworthy mental resilience among the Ukrainian populace; they approach the conflict with a defiant spirit, striving to uphold their identity and lifestyle amid adversity. The attitude of leading a normal life as a form of resistance against aggression emphasizes their commitment to maintaining daily activities, which magnifies the notion of living amidst challenges [Query2_evidence_2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7].\n\nIn conclusion, while the threat of military conflict looms large, the evidence suggests that Kyiv residents are making concerted efforts to preserve their normal lives and socialize, demonstrating resilience through adaptation and community engagement.", "Confidence": "85%"}},

Nonetheless, Ukrainian government officials have warned citizens not to visit beaches as authorities continue to survey the water nearby for explosive objects.\\nA Washington Post article published June 12, 2022, reported how divers have been finding unexploded munitions in lakes throughout Kyiv's suburbs too.\\nAs well as the threat of explosive devices, the divers told the Post their own fears that Russian spies and saboteurs may be watching their work, \\\"helping the Russians plan a new invasion in this part of the country,\\\" the report states, describing the absence of swimmers, motorboats and jet skis as \\\"surreal.\\\"\\nMoreover, while the photos taken along the Dnieper river and elsewhere may look picturesque, Kyiv still endures occasional airstrikes as volunteers take to clearing some of the destruction caused earlier this year.\\nAir raid warnings are issued across much of the country on an almost daily basis. But even in other parts of the country, where the threat of conflict is more palpable, residents have been pictured using beaches and public spaces too.\\nIn unverified posts Newsweek found on social media app Telegram, video recordings appear to show Ukrainians in Odessa (far closer to the theatre of war than Kyiv) reading poetry in public as missile defense systems fire behind them, and sunbathing on the beach by barriers installed to prevent sea invasion.\\nOther posts claim citizens have died from mines while using Odessa's coastline (the post can be found here [graphic content warning]).\\nIt also goes without saying that photos depicting the actions of a select group of people may not necessarily reflect the actions and attitudes of others. In 2020, thousands of people visited public beaches and parks in the U.S. and Europe in spite of COVID-19 social distancing restrictions, no working vaccines, and large case numbers.\\nFor many it becomes a show of defiance, as the liberties taken away during these types of crises become more important than the risks of exercising them (although with fighting in Ky...[Content truncated]\"\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"evidence1\": {\n            \"title\": \"Newsweek - News, Analysis, Politics, Business, Technology\",\n            \"link\": \"https://www.newsweek.com/\",\n            \"displayLink\": \"www.newsweek.com\",\n            \"snippet\": \"Newsweek provides in-depth analysis, news and opinion about international issues, technology, business, culture and politics.\",\n            \"htmlSnippet\": \"Newsweek provides in-depth <b>analysis</b>, news and opinion about international issues, technology, business, culture and politics.\",\n            \"website_content\": \"Newsweek - News, Analysis, Politics, Business, Technology\\n===============\\n\u00d7\\n]\\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   Login\\n\u00d7\\nLogin\\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\nShare\\nCopy Link\\n\u2713 Link copied to clipboard!\\n ]\\nTop Story\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMon, Jul 29, 2024\\n2 MIN READ\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n3 MIN READ\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n2 MIN READ\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n2 MIN READ\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n2 MIN READ\\nThe Daily Debate\\nShould the Military Implement the Draft?\\n----------------------------------------\\n]\\n### \\n### \\n]\\nTop stories\\n-------------\\n-\\nTrending\\n----------\\nOpinion\\n---------\\nTop Stories\\n-----------\\n ]\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJohn Yoo, who clerked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, flagged that implementing Biden's plan could take \\\"years.\\\"\\n2 MIN READ\\n ]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n2 MIN READ\\n ]\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n2 MIN READ\\n ]\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n2 MIN READ\\n ]\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n5 MIN READ\\nTRENDING\\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n*   \\n!\\nNewsletter\\nWORLD IN BRIEF Venezuela Election Results Disputed...[Content truncated]\"\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"evidence2\": {\n            \"title\": \"Result Page 9 for Ukraine Crisis news & latest pictures from ...\",\n            \"link\": \"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/ukraine-crisis?page=9\",\n            \"displayLink\": \"www.newsweek.com\",\n            \"snippet\": \"241-270 (out of 583) All the latest breaking news on Ukraine Crisis.

2024-07-29 19:17:09,413 - ThreadPoolExecutor-2_1 - INFO - Here are the evaluations for each evidence provided in the context of the claim about the beach party in Kyiv and whether it serves as evidence that the conflict in Ukraine is a hoax.

### Evidence Evaluations

**evidence0**
- **RelevanceScore**: 8/10
- **Justification**: This evidence discusses the public's use of beaches in Ukraine amidst ongoing conflict and highlights the psychological resilience of Ukrainians. It suggests that while life continues normally in some areas, this should not be interpreted as evidence that the war is fabricated; instead, it indicates a defiance against the adversity they face. This evidence provides a nuanced understanding that some individuals may appear to engage in leisure activities like a beach party, but it does not confirm that these scenes are staged or represent the entirety of the situation.

**evidence1**
- **RelevanceScore**: 5/10
- **Justification**: This evidence is a general source of news and analysis and does not specifically address whether the beach atmosphere in the video is genuine or staged. While it provides context to the ongoing conflict, it does not provide direct support related to the specifics of the beach party claim.

**evidence2**
- **RelevanceScore**: 4/10
- **Justification**: This is a collection of news articles about the Ukraine crisis. While it shows the prevalence of reporting related to the conflict, it fails to directly discuss the beach party video or any specific evidence of whether it is staged or genuine.

**evidence3**
- **RelevanceScore**: 3/10
- **Justification**: This evidence provides information about Yevgeny Kuklychev, a journalist, but contains no content relevant to the claim. It does not touch upon the beach party or any factors that would support or challenge the video's authenticity.

**evidence4**
- **RelevanceScore**: 6/10
- **Justification**: This article summarises the narrative around the war from Russian media. While it indirectly relates to the broader media portrayal of conflict, it does not specifically address the beach party video or comment on the authenticity of such portrayals amid war.

**evidence5**
- **RelevanceScore**: 4/10
- **Justification**: This piece discusses tactical changes in the Russian military in response to battlefield losses, which could provide context about ongoing military actions but does not engage with the beach party's authenticity or its portrayal in the video.

**evidence6**
- **RelevanceScore**: 3/10
- **Justification**: This evidence highlights general events expected to impact world events in 2024 and makes no direct references to the claim or any specific beach activity that would address the question of the video's authenticity.

**evidence7**
- **RelevanceScore**: 2/10
- **Justification**: As a general page summarizing news articles about the Ukraine war, it lacks any specific connection or content that addresses the specific scenario of a beach party or the veracity of the claim.

**evidence8**
- **RelevanceScore**: 2/10
- **Justification**: This article addresses U.S. reconnaissance and its implications in the Ukraine conflict but does not provide any relevant information regarding beach activities or their authenticity amid the conflict.

**evidence9**
- **RelevanceScore**: 1/10
- **Justification**: This page discusses corrections and policy of Newsweek but does not deal with issues pertinent to the claim of the beach party's authenticity or any relevant aspect of the ongoing conflict. 

### Summary Scores
- **evidence0**: 8/10
- **evidence1**: 5/10
- **evidence2**: 4/10
- **evidence3**: 3/10
- **evidence4**: 6/10
- **evidence5**: 4/10
- **evidence6**: 3/10
- **evidence7**: 2/10
- **evidence8**: 2/10
- **evidence9**: 1/10

The most relevant evidence is evidence0, which discusses the existence of leisure activities in conflict zones without suggesting that such moments invalidate the realities of war. The other pieces, although they contribute context to the ongoing situation in Ukraine, do not directly respond to the question of the beach party’s authenticity.

"Task": "Based on the information of each evidence in 'Evidences', especially the content of website_content, evaluate the relevance of this evidence to the current question (RelevanceScore, 0~10 points, provide a score). Consider how closely the evidence addresses the specifics of the question 'What evidence supports that the lively beach atmosphere in the video is genuine and not staged amid conflict?', with a strong emphasis on how the evidence helps in determining whether the Claim and Video_information constitute false news. Evidence that significantly aids in judging the veracity of the Claim and Video_information should receive higher scores, while less relevant evidence should receive lower scores. The more the evidence helps in determining the truthfulness of the Claim and Video_information, the higher the RelevanceScore should be.

2024-07-29 19:19:16,838 - ThreadPoolExecutor-2_0 - INFO - 1. **evidence0**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 8
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses the false claims that the Ukrainian war is a hoax and highlights the multitude of documented reports and footage from the conflict. While it doesn't directly address the beach party's authenticity, it indicates that the overall narrative of the war is well substantiated, implying that reports of tranquility are likely genuine, not staged. It is significant because it counters the claim that the conflict is fabricated.

2. **evidence1**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 4
   - **Justification**: This evidence details military actions and recaptures in Ukraine but does not address the specific beach party video or provide evidence that could help determine if the beach atmosphere was staged or genuine. Thus, it has limited relevance to the question.

3. **evidence2**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 3
   - **Justification**: The content focuses on military operations and political discussions rather than personal or community experiences related to the beach party. While it maintains the context of ongoing conflict, it does not offer any insights into the authenticity of the beach atmosphere.

4. **evidence3**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 2
   - **Justification**: Like evidence1 and evidence2, this piece does not provide specific details on the beach party or the atmosphere in Kyiv. It centers on unrelated political happenings and does not address the claim of whether the beach video was staged.

5. **evidence4**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 1
   - **Justification**: This evidence discusses corruption within Ukrainian politics rather than conflict or daily life experiences in Kyiv during the war. It is largely irrelevant to the question regarding the beach atmosphere authenticity.

6. **evidence5**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 1
   - **Justification**: This evidence pertains to a U.S. political situation rather than the Ukrainian conflict or the beach party itself, making it irrelevant to the question posed about the authenticity of the beach video.

7. **evidence6**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 6
   - **Justification**: This evidence focuses on the resilience of Ukraine's tourism sector despite the ongoing conflict. It suggests that life continues in certain sectors of Ukraine, which could indirectly support the idea that leisure activities, like those depicted in the beach video, may be genuine rather than staged, although it doesn't specifically address the beach party.

8. **evidence7**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 2
   - **Justification**: This set of news updates is too varied and does not tie into the specific atmospheric description of the beach party in Kyiv. Its connection to the authenticity of the beach party video is tenuous at best.

9. **evidence8**:
   - **RelevanceScore**: 1
   - **Justification**: Similar to evidence5, it focuses on the onset of the war in Ukraine back in 2022 and does not provide any relevant information to assess the beach party’s genuineness.

10. **evidence9**:
    - **RelevanceScore**: 1
    - **Justification**: This is a biographical piece about President Zelensky and doesn't pertain to the specific question of the authenticity of the beach atmosphere during wartime, making it irrelevant to the claim.

  "Initial_Question_Generation": {
    "Question": "Is there evidence of ongoing conflict in Kyiv contradicting a peaceful beach party portrayal?",
    "Answer": "Yes, there is substantial evidence of ongoing conflict in Ukraine that contradicts the portrayal of a peaceful beach party in Kyiv.\n\n1. **Continuous Conflict in Avdiivka**: A recent report describes the dire situation in Avdiivka, where civilians are suffering under constant bombardment. The town has been heavily affected by fighting, with the population dwindling from over 30,000 to just over 1,000 due to the ongoing conflict. The intense urban warfare and air strikes highlight that many areas in Ukraine are experiencing severe conflict, which sharply contrasts the serene setting depicted in the beach party video [Query1_evidence1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7].\n\n2. **Prolonged Military Stalemate**: An analysis from November 2023 indicates that the battlefield situation in Ukraine remains grim, with no significant breakthroughs expected. The Ukrainian military chief noted that the conflict continues to drag on, with Russian forces maintaining substantial control over a fifth of Ukraine. This suggests that, despite some areas possibly appearing tranquil, the overarching reality is one of sustained military engagement and crises, which further contradicts any notion of a hoax regarding the war [Query1_evidence2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7].\n\n3. **Missile Attacks on Kyiv**: Ensuing updates give insight into missile, drone, and bombing attacks targeting Kyiv, reinforcing that the conflict is active and ongoing. Such military actions directly contradict the imagery of a carefree beach activity, indicating that while some areas might seem peaceful in the moment, the threat of violence and actual warfare is ever-present [Query2_evidence1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7].\n\nThrough this analysis, it is clear that the portrayal of a leisure setting like a beach party in Kyiv is at odds with the reality of the conflict, which is evidenced by the severe conditions faced by civilians and military assessments.",

  "Follow_Up_Question_1": {
    "Question": "What specific evidence confirms that Kyiv residents are living normally despite ongoing military threats?",
    "Answer": "Despite ongoing military threats, specific evidence confirms that Kyiv residents are managing to live normally in several ways:\n\n1. **Daily Life Resilience**: People in Kyiv continue to engage in everyday activities like dining and socializing. A report highlighted that, despite facing numerous missile and drone attacks, the streets are filled with traffic, and outdoor cafes are bustling with patrons. This demonstrates that residents are attempting to maintain a semblance of normalcy amid conflict [Query2_evidence_1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7].\n\n2. **Adaptation to Air Raid Alerts**: Residents are actively using technology to navigate the dangers posed by the conflict. They utilize the Air Alert! app, which provides timely warnings of incoming threats, indicating that citizens have adapted to living with the reality of air raids and have developed strategies to protect themselves, enhancing their sense of safety even during conflicts [Query2_evidence_1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7][Query2_evidence_2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7].\n\n3. **Community and Social Activities**: The emergence of new businesses and the continued operation of restaurants and bookshops suggest an effort by residents to rebuild and persist in their community life. These establishments are indicative of a population that, despite the stress of war, is committed to maintaining their cultural and social practices [Query2_evidence_2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7].\n\n4. **Psychological Resilience**: There is a noteworthy mental resilience among the Ukrainian populace; they approach the conflict with a defiant spirit, striving to uphold their identity and lifestyle amid adversity. The attitude of leading a normal life as a form of resistance against aggression emphasizes their commitment to maintaining daily activities, which magnifies the notion of living amidst challenges [Query2_evidence_2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7].\n\nIn conclusion, while the threat of military conflict looms large, the evidence suggests that Kyiv residents are making concerted efforts to preserve their normal lives and socialize, demonstrating resilience through adaptation and community engagement.",

Nonetheless, Ukrainian government officials have warned citizens not to visit beaches as authorities continue to survey the water nearby for explosive objects.\nA Washington Post article published June 12, 2022, reported how divers have been finding unexploded munitions in lakes throughout Kyiv's suburbs too.\nAs well as the threat of explosive devices, the divers told the Post their own fears that Russian spies and saboteurs may be watching their work, \"helping the Russians plan a new invasion in this part of the country,\" the report states, describing the absence of swimmers, motorboats and jet skis as \"surreal.\"\nMoreover, while the photos taken along the Dnieper river and elsewhere may look picturesque, Kyiv still endures occasional airstrikes as volunteers take to clearing some of the destruction caused earlier this year.\nAir raid warnings are issued across much of the country on an almost daily basis. But even in other parts of the country, where the threat of conflict is more palpable, residents have been pictured using beaches and public spaces too.\nIn unverified posts Newsweek found on social media app Telegram, video recordings appear to show Ukrainians in Odessa (far closer to the theatre of war than Kyiv) reading poetry in public as missile defense systems fire behind them, and sunbathing on the beach by barriers installed to prevent sea invasion.\nOther posts claim citizens have died from mines while using Odessa's coastline (the post can be found here [graphic content warning]).\nIt also goes without saying that photos depicting the actions of a select group of people may not necessarily reflect the actions and attitudes of others.

2024-07-29 19:19:36,669 - MainThread - INFO - **EvidenceIsUseful: yes**

**Reason:** The evidence provided supports the argument that the lively beach atmosphere in the video could be genuine rather than staged amid conflict. 

1. **Query1_evidence_1** discusses the rise of conspiracy theories suggesting that the war in Ukraine is a hoax, pointing out the widespread engagement with false claims. This highlights that while some may perceive leisurely activities like a beach party as evidence of a staged war, these claims lack substantiation against the backdrop of extensive coverage and firsthand accounts of the actual conflict.

2. **Query2_evidence_1** elaborates on the resilience of Ukrainians in engaging in beach activities despite ongoing threats, suggesting that normal life continues in specific areas like Kyiv. The description of people using beaches in Kyiv is significant as it demonstrates that parts of the city can maintain a lively atmosphere, even with the backdrop of conflict, ultimately indicating that the beach party could indeed be reflecting genuine life rather than being orchestrated.

3. **Query1_evidence_2** provides additional context to the tourism sector in Ukraine, indicating that despite the war, hotels and recreational venues like ski resorts remain busy. This reinforces the notion that life continues in various forms in Ukraine, which can include social gatherings at beach clubs.

Together, these pieces of evidence validate that the lively beach atmosphere portrayed in the video can coexist with the realities of war, supporting the idea that it is genuine.

        "Answer": "Despite ongoing military threats, specific evidence confirms that Kyiv residents are managing to live normally in several ways:\n\n1. **Daily Life Resilience**: People in Kyiv continue to engage in everyday activities like dining and socializing. A report highlighted that, despite facing numerous missile and drone attacks, the streets are filled with traffic, and outdoor cafes are bustling with patrons. This demonstrates that residents are attempting to maintain a semblance of normalcy amid conflict [Query2_evidence_1····].\n\n2. **Adaptation to Air Raid Alerts**: Residents are actively using technology to navigate the dangers posed by the conflict. They utilize the Air Alert! app, which provides timely warnings of incoming threats, indicating that citizens have adapted to living with the reality of air raids and have developed strategies to protect themselves, enhancing their sense of safety even during conflicts [Query2_evidence_1····][Query2_evidence_2····].\n\n3. **Community and Social Activities**: The emergence of new businesses and the continued operation of restaurants and bookshops suggest an effort by residents to rebuild and persist in their community life. These establishments are indicative of a population that, despite the stress of war, is committed to maintaining their cultural and social practices [Query2_evidence_2····].\n\n4. **Psychological Resilience**: There is a noteworthy mental resilience among the Ukrainian populace; they approach the conflict with a defiant spirit, striving to uphold their identity and lifestyle amid adversity. The attitude of leading a normal life as a form of resistance against aggression emphasizes their commitment to maintaining daily activities, which magnifies the notion of living amidst challenges [Query2_evidence_2····].\n\nIn conclusion, while the threat of military conflict looms large, the evidence suggests that Kyiv residents are making concerted efforts to preserve their normal lives and socialize, demonstrating resilience through adaptation and community engagement.",

2024-07-29 19:19:51,020 - MainThread - INFO - The evidence supporting that the lively beach atmosphere in the video is genuine and not staged amid conflict includes several key observations about the current situation in Ukraine, particularly in Kyiv:

1. **Continuing Urban Life in Kyiv**: Reports indicate that despite the ongoing conflict, many areas of Kyiv continue to show signs of life and normalcy. For instance, people regularly dine out, engage in social activities, and partake in leisurely pursuits such as visiting beaches, indicating a desire to maintain a sense of normalcy. This resilience amid adversity can be seen in similar contexts where citizens engage with their environment despite the pressures of war [Query1_evidence2····].

2. **Tourism and Activity in Ukraine**: Even with the war ongoing, some sectors of Ukraine's economy, including tourism, continue to thrive. Specifically, hotels and public areas are reported to have significant occupancy and activity levels. For example, the Hotel Leopolis in Lviv has seen high occupancy rates despite the war, reflecting a broader trend of people participating in normal activities when possible [Query1_evidence1····]. This indicates that leisure activities, including those captured in the beach party video, are part of the daily life in certain contexts, even amid the prevailing conflict.

3. **Documentation of Daily Life**: While there are concerns regarding safety and military threats, life in Kyiv continues to reflect a blend of normal activities and conflict awareness. Various reports have shown that residents of Kyiv are adapting to the reality of their environment through technology (like air raid apps) and community engagement. Such activities suggest that the beach scene depicted isn't isolated but rather part of a larger narrative of life continuing in a challenging situation [Query1_evidence2····].

4. **Community Resilience**: The spirit of defiance among Ukrainians, demonstrated through their engagement in social and recreational activities, underscores that the beach party reflects genuine community life rather than a staged event. Reports indicate that people continue to participate in public life, capturing a desire to uphold their identity and lifestyle amid ongoing threats [Query1_evidence2····].

Overall, these points suggest that while Kyiv residents are aware of and affected by the conflict, the lively atmosphere depicted in the beach party video is genuine and reflects the complex reality of living in a war zone, where community resilience manifests in social activities.

**Confidence in the answer: 85%** - The reasoning is based on a combination of documented urban life and tourism activity despite the conflict, as well as a consistent theme of resilience among the populace, which supports the authenticity of the video.

The camera then focuses on a man preparing a drink before shifting to a couple enjoying the beach ambiance. Subsequently, the frame transitions to another man engaging in drink preparation. The key frame highlights consist of several snapshots showcasing a beach club in Kyiv during a war.

For instance, people regularly dine out, engage in social activities, and partake in leisurely pursuits such as visiting beaches, indicating a desire to maintain a sense of normalcy. This resilience amid adversity can be seen in similar contexts where citizens engage with their environment despite the pressures of war.\n\n2. **Tourism and Activity in Ukraine**: Even with the war ongoing, some sectors of Ukraine's economy, including tourism, continue to thrive. Specifically, hotels and public areas are reported to have significant occupancy and activity levels. For example, the Hotel Leopolis in Lviv has seen high occupancy rates despite the war, reflecting a broader trend of people participating in normal activities when possible. This indicates that leisure activities, including those captured in the beach party video, are part of the daily life in certain contexts, even amid the prevailing conflict.\n\n3. **Documentation of Daily Life**: While there are concerns regarding safety and military threats, life in Kyiv continues to reflect a blend of normal activities and conflict awareness.

Such activities suggest that the beach scene depicted isn't isolated but rather part of a larger narrative of life continuing in a challenging situation.\n\n4. **Community Resilience**: The spirit of defiance among Ukrainians, demonstrated through their engagement in social and recreational activities, underscores that the beach party reflects genuine community life rather than a staged event.
