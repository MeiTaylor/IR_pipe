The relative silence did not go unnoticed by Biden’s critics, including former President Donald Trump and other Republicans, and the Biden administration in recent days has been promoting its commitment to helping local authorities recover and rebuild.\n    \n\n            The Bidens, Jean-Pierre said, will “see firsthand the impacts of the wildfires and the devastating loss of life and land that has occurred on the island, as well as discuss the next steps in the recovery effort.”\n    \n\n            Biden said in Wisconsin on Tuesday that he did not want a presidential visit, which requires a significant security and operational footprint, to interfere with efforts or divert response resources on the ground. \n    \n\n            But Hawaii Democratic Gov. Josh Green, Jean-Pierre said, “advised that the search and recovery efforts are expected to be at a stage early next week to allow for a presidential visit.”\n    \n\n            The White House is taking care to ensure Biden’s visit to Hawaii will not disrupt recovery efforts on the island, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell told reporters Wednesday.\n    \n\n            “Our biggest goal was to make sure that we weren’t going to disrupt the ability of our search and rescue teams to continue their operations, and when I was just briefing the president and he spoke with [Green], he asked the governor if this was going to be an appropriate time and the governor agreed,” Criswell told reporters during Wednesday’s White House press briefing.\n    \n\n            Biden has stayed in close...[Content truncated]",

Rico, Trump was widely condemned for his chaotic and unreliable statements as the Covid-19 pandemic unfolded.\n    \n\n            When disasters strike, presidents need to tackle the situation on at least three different fronts. Federal support for the local response is paramount, which Biden has been working on. Broader public policy decisions — whether that be addressing climate change or FEMA’s shortfalls — are also essential. The climate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act have been some of the strongest initiatives thus far to push the nation toward renewable energy. Without the first two elements, presidents are only putting band-aids on whatever went wrong.\n    \n\n            But the third part, the public-facing response — whether it be meeting with survivors, surveying the damage or making speeches and formal statements — matters as well. The public wants to see a president who can lead the nation through a crisis. They seek elected officials who can stay in control amidst the chaos and help those who need it. They look for presidents who can address the nation and do so with the kind of presence that President Ronald Reagan had after the Space Shuttle Challenger crashed in 1986. He helped the nation mourn when he gave one of his most moving speeches on television and said, “We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and ‘slipped the surly bonds of earth’ to ‘touch the face of God.’”\n    \n\n            Biden has a chance to right some of the missteps and take a more assertive role, without becoming an overwhelming presence. With this trip, Biden needs to demonstrate that the federal government will be making sure Hawaii can recover and rebuild, and that he will work with Congress to address the underlying causes. And Biden should offer hope and moral support to the survivors — a task that shouldn’t be difficult, given that he is known for his empathy. While he might not match Reagan, he certainly can’t afford to make the mistakes that George W. Bush did.\n    \n\nThis article has been updated to note Biden’s statements about Maui.\n\n© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

About 2,700 homes are reported to have been destroyed.\nIncredibly strong winds from Hurricane Dora, which passed south of Hawaii on Tuesday 8 August fanned the flames and prevented aircraft from flying over the town during the fire - but once they had passed, pilots were shocked by what they saw.\n\"It's horrifying. I've flown here 52 years and I've never seen anything come close to that,\" helicopter pilot Richard Olsten told the Associated Press news agency. \"We had tears in our eyes.\" \nThe flames destroyed most of the buildings in front of the port, including the old courthouse.\nAnger has grown among the community with many people telling the BBC they were not forewarned about the fires. It is currently unclear if early warning systems were used, or if they malfunctioned.\nThe town's lighthouse has survived but most of the surrounding buildings were destroyed, including the oldest hotel in Hawaii - the 122-year-old Pioneer Inn.\nThe centre of Lahaina dated back to the 1700s and was on the US National Register of Historic Places - it was once Hawaii's capital.\nThe town was home to about 12,000 people - the initial assessments say about 86% of the damaged buildings were residential.\nAlice Lee, chair of the Maui County Council, told the BBC World Service's Newsday programme how the fire razed the \"beautiful\" Front Street, the town's main strip.\n\"The fire traversed almost the entire street, so all the shops and little restaurants that people visited on their trips to Maui, most of them are burnt down to the ground,\" Lee said, adding: \"So many businesses will have to struggle to recover,\" she said.\nFormer US President Barack Obama - who was born in Hawaii - is among those who has expressed his sorrow at the...[Content truncated]",

Credit...Bryan Anselm for The New York Times\n**Bret Stephens:** Before we get to Donald Trump’s indictment in Georgia or the upcoming G.O.P. debate, I want to take note of the appalling tragedy in Hawaii. The images from Maui are just heartbreaking. But I also get a sense that heartbreak will soon turn to outrage as we learn more about the cascade of  that led to the disaster.\n**Gail Collins:** Maui is going to be hard for any of us to forget. Or, in some cases, forgive. There are certainly a heck of a lot of serious questions about whether the folks who were supposed to be responsible did their jobs.\n**Bret:** There’s  that made me want to scream. It seems Hawaiian Electric knew four years ago that it needed to do more to keep power lines from emitting sparks, but it invested only $245,000 to try to do something about it. The state and private owners let old dams fall into disrepair and then allowed for them to be destroyed rather than restoring them, leading to less stored water and more dry land. And then there was the emergency chief who decided not to sound warning sirens. At least he had the good sense to resign.\n**Gail:** But let’s look at the way bigger issue, Bret. The weather’s been awful in all sorts of scary ways this summer, all around the planet. Pretty clear it’s because of global warming. You ready to rally around a big push toward environmental revolution?\n**Bret:** I’m opposed on principle to all big revolutions, Gail, beginning with the French. But I am in favor of 10,000 evolutions to deal with the climate. In...[Content truncated]",

As more neighborhoods are deemed safe, they, too, will be opened to residents who show proof of residency and obtain a re-entry permit, officials said at a public informational meeting in Lahaina on Sept. 22.\nThe Maui County authorities will provide returnees with masks and other personal protective equipment for the visit, official said, and will have counselors on hand to help with the emotional aspects of the visit.\nThere are significant worries about how much it will cost for residents to rebuild homes — an early estimate projects that $5.5 billion will be needed to repair damaged areas in West Maui — as well as the economic revival of a tourism-dependent island.\nHere’s what else we know.\nImage\nResidents searching for belongings in Lahaina.Credit...Philip Cheung for The New York Times\n* * *\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
