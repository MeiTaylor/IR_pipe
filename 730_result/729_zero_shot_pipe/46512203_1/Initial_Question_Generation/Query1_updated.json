Rico, Trump was widely condemned for his chaotic and unreliable statements as the Covid-19 pandemic unfolded.\n    \n\n            When disasters strike, presidents need to tackle the situation on at least three different fronts. Federal support for the local response is paramount, which Biden has been working on. Broader public policy decisions \u2014 whether that be addressing climate change or FEMA\u2019s shortfalls \u2014 are also essential. The climate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act have been some of the strongest initiatives thus far to push the nation toward renewable energy. Without the first two elements, presidents are only putting band-aids on whatever went wrong.\n    \n\n            But the third part, the public-facing response \u2014 whether it be meeting with survivors, surveying the damage or making speeches and formal statements \u2014 matters as well. The public wants to see a president who can lead the nation through a crisis. They seek elected officials who can stay in control amidst the chaos and help those who need it. They look for presidents who can address the nation and do so with the kind of presence that President Ronald Reagan had after the Space Shuttle Challenger crashed in 1986. He helped the nation mourn when he gave one of his\u00a0most moving speeches on television\u00a0and said, \u201cWe will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and \u2018slipped the surly bonds of earth\u2019 to \u2018touch the face of God.\u2019\u201d\n    \n\n            Biden has a chance to right some of the missteps and take a more assertive role, without becoming an overwhelming presence. With this trip, Biden needs to demonstrate that the federal government will be making sure Hawaii can recover and rebuild, and that he will work with Congress to address the underlying causes. And Biden should offer hope and moral support to the survivors \u2014\u00a0a task that shouldn\u2019t be difficult, given that he is known for his empathy. While he might not match Reagan, he certainly can\u2019t afford to make the mistakes that George W. Bush did.\n    \n\nThis article has been updated to note Biden\u2019s statements about Maui.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

About 2,700 homes are reported to have been destroyed.\nIncredibly strong winds from Hurricane Dora, which passed south of Hawaii on Tuesday 8 August fanned the flames and prevented aircraft from flying over the town during the fire - but once they had passed, pilots were shocked by what they saw.\n\"It's horrifying.

It is currently unclear if early warning systems were used, or if they malfunctioned.\nThe town's lighthouse has survived but most of the surrounding buildings were destroyed, including the oldest hotel in Hawaii - the 122-year-old Pioneer Inn.\nThe centre of Lahaina dated back to the 1700s and was on the US National Register of Historic Places - it was once Hawaii's capital.\nThe town was home to about 12,000 people - the initial assessments say about 86% of the damaged buildings were residential.\nAlice Lee, chair of the Maui County Council, told the BBC World Service's Newsday programme how the fire razed the \"beautiful\" Front Street, the town's main strip.\n\"The fire traversed almost the entire street, so all the shops and little restaurants that people visited on their trips to Maui, most of them are burnt down to the ground,\" Lee said, adding: \"So many businesses will have to struggle to recover,\" she said.\nFormer US President Barack Obama - who was born in Hawaii - is among those who has expressed his sorrow at the...[Content truncated]",

Credit...Bryan Anselm for The New York Times\n**Bret Stephens:** Before we get to Donald Trump\u2019s indictment in Georgia or the upcoming G.O.P. debate, I want to take note of the appalling tragedy in Hawaii. The images from Maui are just heartbreaking. But I also get a sense that heartbreak will soon turn to outrage as we learn more about the cascade of  that led to the disaster.\n**Gail Collins:** Maui is going to be hard for any of us to forget.

It seems Hawaiian Electric knew four years ago that it needed to do more to keep power lines from emitting sparks, but it invested only $245,000 to try to do something about it. The state and private owners let old dams fall into disrepair and then allowed for them to be destroyed rather than restoring them, leading to less stored water and more dry land. And then there was the emergency chief who decided not to sound warning sirens. At least he had the good sense to resign.\n**Gail:** But let\u2019s look at the way bigger issue, Bret. The weather\u2019s been awful in all sorts of scary ways this summer, all around the planet. Pretty clear it\u2019s because of global warming. You ready to rally around a big push toward environmental revolution?\n**Bret:** I\u2019m opposed on principle to all big revolutions, Gail, beginning with the French. But I am in favor of 10,000 evolutions to deal with the climate. In...[Content truncated]",

As more neighborhoods are deemed safe, they, too, will be opened to residents who show proof of residency and obtain a re-entry permit, officials said at a public informational meeting in Lahaina on Sept. 22.\nThe Maui County authorities will provide returnees with masks and other personal protective equipment for the visit, official said, and will have counselors on hand to help with the emotional aspects of the visit.\nThere are significant worries about how much it will cost for residents to rebuild homes \u2014 an early estimate projects that $5.5 billion will be needed to repair damaged areas in West Maui \u2014 as well as the economic revival of a tourism-dependent island.\nHere\u2019s what else we know.\nImage\nResidents searching for belongings in Lahaina.Credit...Philip Cheung for The New York Times\n* * *\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
