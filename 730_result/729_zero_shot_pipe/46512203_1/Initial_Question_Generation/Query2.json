He was asked about it and he said no comment. Are you kidding me?\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said. \"As somebody that's handled disasters in Florida, you've got to be activated. You've got to be there. You've got to be present.\"\nFormer President Donald Trump weighed in on Truth Social the day after Biden's remark. \"To say ‘no comment’ is oftentimes fine, but to be smiling when you say it, especially against such a tragedy as this, is absolutely horrible and unacceptable,\" Trump said.\nAmid scrutiny over the remark, the Biden administration has made extra efforts to detail how the federal government is responding to the deadliest U.S. wildfires in more than a century.\nBiden visited Maui on Monday, pledging to provide federal assistance \"as long as it takes\" to ensure Maui recovers. Biden waited nearly two weeks to visit Hawaii, a delay the White House said was necessary to avoid interfering with search and rescue efforts. Biden spoke publicly about the wildfires three times before his visit.\nThe Biden administration approved more than $10 million in federal assistance to more than 3,000 households in response to the Maui wildfires as of Tuesday, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. More than 1,000 federal personnel have been on the ground in Maui assisting resident including 430 search and rescue teams.\n_Contributing: USA TODAY White House correspondent Maureen Groppe_.\n_Reach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison._\nFeatured Weekly Ad\n© 2024 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC.",
