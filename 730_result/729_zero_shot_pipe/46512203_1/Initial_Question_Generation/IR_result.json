            "content": "\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday said he will travel to Maui soon to visit the devastation left behind by wildfires that ravaged the Hawaiian island last week, leaving scores dead and untold damage.\n    \n\n            In his first comments on the disaster since late last week, Biden said he wanted to ensure a possible presidential visit wouldn’t impede recovery efforts.\n    \n\n            “My wife Jill and I are going to travel to Hawaii as soon as we can, that’s what I’ve been talking to governor about,” he said. “I don’t want to get in the way – I’ve been to too many disaster areas, but I want to go and make sure we got everything they need. I want to be sure we don’t disrupt the ongoing recovery efforts.”\n    \n\n            The remarks were Biden’s first public comments about the unfolding disaster in Hawaii since last Thursday, when he similarly began a prescheduled speech addressing the devastation. The period of silence had not gone unnoticed by Biden’s critics, including former President Donald Trump and other Republicans.\n    \n\n            Biden’s aides have pointed to the president’s frequent phone calls with FEMA leadership, Hawaii’s congressional delegation and its governor as evidence of his sustained engagement. So far, Democrats have publicly supported Biden’s response. The president has been in regular contact with Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, who has publicly praised the administration’s response and the president’s “full support.” Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii...[Content truncated]"

While the platform has been plagued by technical issues after Elon Musk bought the site last year, many link delays this week appeared intentional, cybersecurity experts said, as the issues mainly affected X’s rivals and news outlets that Musk has previously criticized.\n    \n\n            Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.\n    \n\n      Your day is busy. 5 Things is your one-stop shop for the latest headlines, plus other stories and videos that people are clicking on.

Identification is challenging and will likely take weeks because the remains are largely unrecognizable and fingerprints are rarely being found, Gov. Josh Green said Tuesday. So far, family members of missing people have provided 41 DNA samples, trying to see whether their loved ones are among the dead, county officials said. As the search expands for more unaccounted people, President Joe Biden on Tuesday said he will travel to Maui soon to visit the devastation. “I want to go and make sure we got everything they need,” Biden said, adding he wants to make sure...[Content truncated]"

    "QA": {
        "Question": "Does the video accurately depict President Trump visiting Maui after the August 2023 wildfires, or is it misleading?",
        "Answer": "The video in question is misleading in its claim that President Donald Trump visited Maui after the August 2023 wildfires. The evidence indicates that Trump has not visited the Hawaiian island in the aftermath of the disaster. Instead, the video that's being circulated actually shows a past event, specifically a visit Trump made in March 2019 to Alabama following a tornado. This misunderstanding has led to the video being falsely portrayed as a recent visit to Maui, where he supposedly interacted with hurricane victims and volunteers. Moreover, during the time that the wildfires were devastating Maui, President Joe Biden was publicly discussing his planned visit to the island to assess the situation, which would have been inconsistent with Trump's involvement in the disaster response. This further supports the conclusion that the video is fabricated or manipulated, as there are no credible reports of Trump's presence in Maui during this time. In conclusion, the claim that the video accurately depicts President Trump visiting Maui post-wildfires is false; it misrepresents a past event and deceives viewers about his involvement in the response to the recent disaster.",
