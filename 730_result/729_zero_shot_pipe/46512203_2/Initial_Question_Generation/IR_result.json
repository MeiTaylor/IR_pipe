She said, 'I lost 10, 10 people.”\n!\nThe video was titled:\n> “A real President truly cares. Trump 2024.”\nIn the video, Melania Trump can be seen accompanying the former president, along with a FEMA truck in the background. While the claims have been misguiding a lot of people, upon searching social media, similar videos existed that dated back to March 11, 2019, when the former President visited Beauregard, Alabama, after a tornado killed more than 15 people.\nHence, the claims that  visited the Maui wildfire are false, as the video is old and is being circulated with a fake title.

On the other hand, the former President did speak up on the matter and acknowledged the situation, as he took a dig at the current President, , and said:\n> “I would like to express my sympathy and warmest regards to the people of Hawaii, and specifically all of those who have been so gravely and irreparably hurt by the tragedy of the wildfires in Maui, something the likes of which have seldom been seen anywhere at any time.”\n!\nHe then talked about how the government was \"not prepared\" to deal with the crisis and the wildfires. He also stated that Biden’s government dealt with the aftermath \"very poorly.\" He also talked about Hawaii Gov. Josh Green and stated that the \"governor did nothing and just blamed global warming.\"\nThe Maui fires that started on August 8, 2023, have claimed the lives of more than 100 people. The government has stated that the wildfires began due to global warming and excessive heat from the dry leaves. At the same time, the investigators are digging deep into the matter to find more reasons for the massive fire.\n!\nTalking about the fake news about the former President visiting Maui, one should be extremely careful while sharing such pieces, as they should be shared only if they come from a reliable and verified source.

        "Question": "Is there verifiable evidence that President Trump visited Maui after the August 2023 wildfires as claimed?",
        "Answer": "There is no verifiable evidence that President Trump visited Maui after the August 2023 wildfires, contrary to the claims made in a viral video. The video in question, which claims to show Trump visiting Maui, is actually an old clip from 2019 showing his visit to Alabama following a tornado. This miscaptioned video has been debunked by multiple fact-check sources, confirming that it does not depict a recent visit to Hawaii, but rather a different disaster response. The fact-check reports clarify that the original misinformation originated from social media posts that misrepresented the visuals, leading many to incorrectly believe that Trump had visited Maui amidst the wildfires. The evidence strongly indicates Trump has not been to Maui since the wildfires began in August 2023, and there are no credible reports supporting such a visit.",
