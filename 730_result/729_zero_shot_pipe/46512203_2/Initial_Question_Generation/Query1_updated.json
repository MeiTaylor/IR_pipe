I want to be sure we don\u2019t disrupt the ongoing recovery efforts.\u201d\n    \n\n            The remarks were Biden\u2019s first public comments about the unfolding disaster in Hawaii since last Thursday, when he similarly began a prescheduled speech addressing the devastation. The period of silence had not gone unnoticed by Biden\u2019s critics, including former President Donald Trump and other Republicans.\n    \n\n            Biden\u2019s aides have pointed to the president\u2019s frequent phone calls with FEMA leadership, Hawaii\u2019s congressional delegation and its governor as evidence of his sustained engagement. So far, Democrats have publicly supported Biden\u2019s response. The president has been in regular contact with Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, who has publicly praised the administration\u2019s response and the president\u2019s \u201cfull support.\u201d Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii...[Content truncated]",

He also stated that Biden\u2019s government dealt with the aftermath \"very poorly.\" He also talked about Hawaii Gov. Josh Green and stated that the \"governor did nothing and just blamed global warming.\"\nThe Maui fires that started on August 8, 2023, have claimed the lives of more than 100 people. The government has stated that the wildfires began due to global warming and excessive heat from the dry leaves. At the same time, the investigators are digging deep into the matter to find more reasons for the massive fire.\n!\nTalking about the fake news about the former President visiting Maui, one should be extremely careful while sharing such pieces, as they should be shared only if they come from a reliable and verified source.

The next day, his son became the subject of a federal special counsel investigation. And since then, Biden has said virtually nothing to the media \u2014 not about Hunter or the fires or anything else.\nFour days of silence haven't gone unnoticed \u2014 not by the reporters who pressed White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday about why he has not spoken out more or by Republicans, who piled on criticism that Biden was failing to address the devastation, or by conservative media, who on Tuesday juxtaposed pictures of Biden at the beach with video of the fires.\nDonald Trump, in a video posted between attacks on the prosecutor who indicted him Monday, released  criticizing Biden\u2019s response to the fires.\n\u201cIt is a disgraceful thing that Joe Biden refuses to help or comment on the tragedy in Maui,\u201d he said. Trump also criticized the Democratic governor and referred dismissively to global warming.\nThe White House points to the response on the ground as proof that the Biden administration is taking the catastrophe seriously. Nearly 500 federal workers are deployed in Hawaii. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has provided 50,000 meals, 75,000 liters of water, 5,000 cots and 10,000 blankets. The Coast Guard and the Navy\u2019s 3rd Fleet supported response efforts, and the Marines provided Black Hawk helicopters to fight fires.\nBiden has also spoken with Gov. Josh Green, Sens. Mazie Hirono and Brian Schatz, Hawaii Democrats and other officials.\nHirono, whose office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, has defended the White House's response to the fires,  that she was \"glad to see so many on the right are so concerned about what\u2019s happening in Hawaii\" and asking Republicans to support more funding.\nResidents said over the weekend that they were getting more help from volunteers than from the government,  .\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be lectured by Republican officials in Washington who are doubling down on denial of the climate crisis that is devastating red and blue states, who attempted to slash the wildfire response budget,...[Content truncated]",
