The next day, his son became the subject of a federal special counsel investigation. And since then, Biden has said virtually nothing to the media \u2014 not about Hunter or the fires or anything else.\nFour days of silence haven't gone unnoticed \u2014 not by the reporters who pressed White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday about why he has not spoken out more or by Republicans, who piled on criticism that Biden was failing to address the devastation, or by conservative media, who on Tuesday juxtaposed pictures of Biden at the beach with video of the fires.\nDonald Trump, in a video posted between attacks on the prosecutor who indicted him Monday, released  criticizing Biden\u2019s response to the fires.\n\u201cIt is a disgraceful thing that Joe Biden refuses to help or comment on the tragedy in Maui,\u201d he said. Trump also criticized the Democratic governor and referred dismissively to global warming.\nThe White House points to the response on the ground as proof that the Biden administration is taking the catastrophe seriously. Nearly 500 federal workers are deployed in Hawaii. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has provided 50,000 meals, 75,000 liters of water, 5,000 cots and 10,000 blankets. The Coast Guard and the Navy\u2019s 3rd Fleet supported response efforts, and the Marines provided Black Hawk helicopters to fight fires.\nBiden has also spoken with Gov. Josh Green, Sens. Mazie Hirono and Brian Schatz, Hawaii Democrats and other officials.\nHirono, whose office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, has defended the White House's response to the fires,  that she was \"glad to see so many on the right are so concerned about what\u2019s happening in Hawaii\" and asking Republicans to support more funding.\nResidents said over the weekend that they were getting more help from volunteers than from the government,  .\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be lectured by Republican officials in Washington who are doubling down on denial of the climate crisis that is devastating red and blue states, who attempted to slash the wildfire response budget,...[Content truncated]",

Josh Green said as many as 1,700 buildings were probably destroyed in the fire and it looked like \u201cabout 80% of Lahaina is gone.\u201d\n    \n\n            Identification of Maui fire victims is not imminent as the wildfire death toll continues to climb, according to a county official.\n    \n\n        \u201cWe\u2019re talking about burn victims,\u201d the Maui county official told CNN.\u00a0\u201cIt would be unrealistic to expect identifications anytime soon.\u201d\n    \n\n            As to whether identification would be done on the island, or whether it would happen elsewhere, the official said all options were being discussed.\u00a0\n    \n\n            \u201cI can tell you that we\u2019re actively assessing that,\u201d the official said.\n    \n\nCatastrophic wildfires have ravaged the island of Maui, destroying communities and killing at least 53 people, according to county officials. Others remain unaccounted for.\n    \n\n            Gov. Josh Green, speaking to CNN, cited a previous natural disaster, the 1960 tsunami that caused 61 deaths. \u201cThis time, it\u2019s very likely\u00a0that our death totals will\u00a0significantly exceed that, I\u2019m\u00a0afraid,\u201d he said.\n    \n\n            The historic town of Lahaina, a hub for tourism and Maui\u2019s economy on the west side of the island, has borne the...[Content truncated]",
