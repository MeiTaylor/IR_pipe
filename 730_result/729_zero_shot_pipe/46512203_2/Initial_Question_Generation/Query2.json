Josh Green (D), opining that he wanted “to do nothing but blame \\ on global warming and other things that just popped into his head.” Trump also said that Biden responded to reporters over the weekend by saying, “with a laugh and a smile” that he had “no comment” on the situation.\nThose reporters were trying to ask Biden questions as he was entering a vehicle. In truth, Biden responded to the crisis several days ago, both in words and in action.\n### Related Story\n]\n|\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAmidst historic destruction, activists decry fossil fuels’ role in “apocalyptic” Hawaiian fires.\nBy\n ,\nAugust 13, 2023\n“Jill and I send our deepest condolences to the families of those who lost loved ones in the wildfires in...[Content truncated]",

Maui's emergency management chief resigned last week after the agency faced backlash for failing to activate its alarm system in the wake of the fire. \nTo date, 27 of the deceased have been identified and 11 families had been notified, Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen said earlier on Monday...[Content truncated]",

The next day, his son became the subject of a federal special counsel investigation. And since then, Biden has said virtually nothing to the media — not about Hunter or the fires or anything else.\nFour days of silence haven't gone unnoticed — not by the reporters who pressed White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday about why he has not spoken out more or by Republicans, who piled on criticism that Biden was failing to address the devastation, or by conservative media, who on Tuesday juxtaposed pictures of Biden at the beach with video of the fires.\nDonald Trump, in a video posted between attacks on the prosecutor who indicted him Monday, released  criticizing Biden’s response to the fires.\n“It is a disgraceful thing that Joe Biden refuses to help or comment on the tragedy in Maui,” he said. Trump also criticized the Democratic governor and referred dismissively to global warming.\nThe White House points to the response on the ground as proof that the Biden administration is taking the catastrophe seriously. Nearly 500 federal workers are deployed in Hawaii. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has provided 50,000 meals, 75,000 liters of water, 5,000 cots and 10,000 blankets. The Coast Guard and the Navy’s 3rd Fleet supported response efforts, and the Marines provided Black Hawk helicopters to fight fires.\nBiden has also spoken with Gov. Josh Green, Sens. Mazie Hirono and Brian Schatz, Hawaii Democrats and other officials.\nHirono, whose office didn’t respond to a request for comment, has defended the White House's response to the fires,  that she was \"glad to see so many on the right are so concerned about what’s happening in Hawaii\" and asking Republicans to support more funding.\nResidents said over the weekend that they were getting more help from volunteers than from the government,  .\n“We won’t be lectured by Republican officials in Washington who are doubling down on denial of the climate crisis that is devastating red and blue states, who attempted to slash the wildfire response budget,...[Content truncated]",

Today, as part of this commitment, President Biden is convening Cabinet and Agency officials who are supporting long-term recovery and rebuilding efforts on the ground – to discuss the work underway to support the people of Maui as they heal, rebuild, and recover over the long-term.\nAs President Biden made clear during his visit to Maui last week, the Biden-Harris Administration will do everything in its power to help Maui recover and rebuild from this tragedy. And throughout these efforts, the Administration will remain focused on respecting sacred lands, cultures, and traditions. The Administration will be there as long as it takes to complete response efforts.\nAs part of this commitment, President Biden is today announcing the Department of Energy is providing **$95 million through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to harden Hawai****ʻ****i’s** **electric grid,** improve service, limit damage during future events, and help prevent failures in the future that could lead to severe events. The funding will help strengthen critical transmission lines, including two on Maui; harden poles supporting critical facilities such as hospitals, water facilities, emergency response, and military; replace wooden poles with\nfire-resistant material; deploy intelligent switches and materials to help reduce wildfire risk; remove hazard trees; and, relocate the Maui control center to a more secure and resilient location. This investment will help reduce the likelihood of outages, reduce restoration times following outages, reduce risk of wildfire events, and increase grid operational resilience.\nHundreds of personnel from across dozens of Federal departments and agencies continue working with state and local partners on the ground to assess ongoing needs and provide resources and personnel to support response efforts...[Content truncated]",

Josh Green said as many as 1,700 buildings were probably destroyed in the fire and it looked like “about 80% of Lahaina is gone.”\n    \n\n            Identification of Maui fire victims is not imminent as the wildfire death toll continues to climb, according to a county official.\n    \n\n        “We’re talking about burn victims,” the Maui county official told CNN. “It would be unrealistic to expect identifications anytime soon.”\n    \n\n            As to whether identification would be done on the island, or whether it would happen elsewhere, the official said all options were being discussed. \n    \n\n            “I can tell you that we’re actively assessing that,” the official said.\n    \n\nCatastrophic wildfires have ravaged the island of Maui, destroying communities and killing at least 53 people, according to county officials. Others remain unaccounted for.\n    \n\n            Gov. Josh Green, speaking to CNN, cited a previous natural disaster, the 1960 tsunami that caused 61 deaths. “This time, it’s very likely that our death totals will significantly exceed that, I’m afraid,” he said.\n    \n\n            The historic town of Lahaina, a hub for tourism and Maui’s economy on the west side of the island, has borne the...[Content truncated]",
