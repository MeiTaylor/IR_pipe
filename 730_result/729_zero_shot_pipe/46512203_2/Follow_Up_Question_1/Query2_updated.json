According to the New York Post, the Grammy winner died from both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Her husband, John Reynolds, registered her death as such in London this week. According to the outlet, a respiratory tract infection that O\u2019Connor had at the time of her death was also a contributing factor. Before the official report, the singer was reported to have died of natural causes after being found \u201cunresponsive\u201d in her London apartment. In January 2022, O\u2019Connor lost her second youngest son, Shane Lunny, after he died by suicide. According to People, O\u2019Connor took to Twitter, now X, to mourn his passing in a since-deleted message. \u201cMy beautiful son, Nevi'im Nesta Ali Shane O'Connor, the very light of my life, decided to end his earthly struggle today and is now with God,\" she wrote. O\u2019Connor is survived by three other children, Jake Reynolds, Rois",

Mesa Mayor John Giles invoked the late Sen. John McCain and his motto of \u201cCountry First\u201d in making the case for Harris, saying that Republicans have \u201ca moral and ethical responsibility\u201d to choose country over party come November. Hailing Harris\u2019 candidacy as a return to political \u201cdecency,\u201d the mayor also praised her and President Joe Biden for their work investing in the battleground state\u2019s economy, saying the pair \u201care delivering thousands of new jobs to Arizonans and helping us grow critical industries.\u201d Giles, who has been mayor of Mesa since 2014, also took the opportunity to slam former President Donald Trump, saying he represents a \u201cthreat to democracy.\u201d Ticking off the points against Trump, including his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, Giles noted that the former president has done little to support the Grand Canyon State, preferring to exploit its immigration and border crises for \u201cpersonal political gain.\u201d\n]\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n\u00a9 2024 The Daily Beast Company LLC",
