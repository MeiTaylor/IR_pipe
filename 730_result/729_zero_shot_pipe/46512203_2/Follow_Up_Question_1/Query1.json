He then claimed without evidence that if a public health agency advises against a treatment, then that means the treatment actually works.â\nPolitifact also shot down Ardisâ claim that there are 19 toxins in cobra venom and that number related to the term âCOVID-19.â We already know the â19â in the virusâ name is because this coronavirus was identified in 2019.\nHe also claimed âthat the phrase âcoronavirus pandemicâ can translate in Latin to âthe popeâs venom pandemicâ or âking cobra venom pandemic.â Politifact cited an expert from the worldâs largest dictionary of Latin to show these translations were âcompletely false.â\nWe also reached out to experts who would be aware if there were venomous contaminants in the water supply. The , whose spokesperson said the comments on social media about these conspiracies astounded her.

Trump made similar comments on Thursday after learning he was being indicted by a federal grand jury, posting on social media that âJoe Biden has 1850 Boxes at the University of Delaware.â\n    \n\n            But Trumpâs vague insinuations that there is something improper about the existence of the Biden collection at the University of Delaware are baseless. The collection of donated documents is from Bidenâs 36-year tenure as a US senator for Delaware. Unlike presidents, who are subject to the Presidential Records Act, senators own their officesâ documents and can do whatever they want with them â donate them to colleges, keep them at their homes, give them to journalists, even throw them in the trash.\n    \n\n            âNo statute governs their retention or disposition and there is no public right of access to congressional records, under FOIA or any other statute,â Margaret Kwoka, a law professor at The Ohio State University and an expert on information law, said in a Friday email.\n    \n\n            Trump has also made false specific claims about the boxes of Bidenâs Senate documents. It is not true that ânobody even knows where they are.â It is public knowledge that these documents are stored at his alma mater. It is also not true that Biden âhas been totally uncooperativeâ and âwonât show the documents under any circumstances.â Biden consented to two FBI searches at the university â searches that did not initially appear to turn up any documents with classified markings, a source familiar with the investigation told CNNâs Paula Reid in February, though they were still being analyzed at the time.\n    \n\n            Hereâs a more detailed look at the facts about the documents at the University of Delaware.\n    \n\n            The approximately 1,850 boxes of Biden documents at the University of Delaware are papers from the presidentâs Senate career, which ran from 1973 to 2009 (when Biden was sworn in as vice president). While the Presidential Records Act says that presidential records belong to the public and that the National Archives and Records Administration gets custody of them the moment the president leaves office, records that are created and maintained within a senatorâs office âare the property of the senator,â the Senate website explains. \n    \n\n            And...[Content truncated]",

Apparently, Peters interviews a retired chiropractor named Bryan Ardis about âhis theory that the CDC planted king cobra venom in COVID-19 vaccines and the water supply in order to transfer Satanic DNA to unsuspecting people.â\nYes, thatâs the literal sentence written by Sommer. If you believe this, you didnât even need to be vaccinated to be subjected to âSatanic DNA.â We donât know if thatâs part of the microchip thing. Apparently, all this evolved from a TV show called âThe Blacklist,â in which a character played by James Spader suspects he has been poisoned by snake venom in his drink.\nArdis told Peters, âThey are using the water systems because they can target specific demographics.â Apparently, this video has been seen by millions, and a man in Pennsylvania named  started to market water filtration systems that he said would help remove that cobra venom from your water.\nGodlewski said in a video, Sommer reported, that he âstrongly advised that you stop drinking any water that is tap water, or even bottled water.â He said common filters you might buy for your home couldnât be trusted because at least one of the manufacturers was owned by âthe cabal.â\nSo Godlewski suggested you buy his filters, which, Sommer wrote, some customers complained about because of the price. So he raised $40,000 that he said would help the folks on fixed income buy his filters. \n**Just the facts**\n------------------\nNow this idea that there is snake venom in the COVID-19 vaccines has been around. The hoax claims that itâs in remdesivir, the COVID-19 treatment drug, and, yes, the water supply.\nFactcheck.org felt the need  to say that âCOVID-19 is caused by a virus, not snake venom.â That analysis even explained how the Catholic church was said to be complicit.
