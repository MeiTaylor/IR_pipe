Trump made similar comments on Thursday after learning he was being indicted by a federal grand jury, posting on social media that “Joe Biden has 1850 Boxes at the University of Delaware.”\n    \n\n            But Trump’s vague insinuations that there is something improper about the existence of the Biden collection at the University of Delaware are baseless. The collection of donated documents is from Biden’s 36-year tenure as a US senator for Delaware. Unlike presidents, who are subject to the Presidential Records Act, senators own their offices’ documents and can do whatever they want with them – donate them to colleges, keep them at their homes, give them to journalists, even throw them in the trash.\n    \n\n            “No statute governs their retention or disposition and there is no public right of access to congressional records, under FOIA or any other statute,” Margaret Kwoka, a law professor at The Ohio State University and an expert on information law, said in a Friday email.\n    \n\n            Trump has also made false specific claims about the boxes of Biden’s Senate documents. It is not true that “nobody even knows where they are.” It is public knowledge that these documents are stored at his alma mater. It is also not true that Biden “has been totally uncooperative” and “won’t show the documents under any circumstances.” Biden consented to two FBI searches at the university – searches that did not initially appear to turn up any documents with classified markings, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN’s Paula Reid in February, though they were still being analyzed at the time.\n    \n\n            Here’s a more detailed look at the facts about the documents at the University of Delaware.\n    \n\n            The approximately 1,850 boxes of Biden documents at the University of Delaware are papers from the president’s Senate career, which ran from 1973 to 2009 (when Biden was sworn in as vice president). While the Presidential Records Act says that presidential records belong to the public and that the National Archives and Records Administration gets custody of them the moment the president leaves office, records that are created and maintained within a senator’s office “are the property of the senator,” the Senate website explains. \n    \n\n            And...[Content truncated]",

Instead, they should join him in supporting the people of Maui.”\nThe posts on the country’s largest social media platforms, which largely appear to be spreading unchecked, are the latest test of how Silicon Valley will handle misinformation in the 2024 election cycle — and whether it will enforce its own policies.\nLow-quality videos are an example of what some misinformation researchers call “”: media that can mislead people through simple techniques, even amid growing concerns about more advanced ways to create misleading content through generative artificial intelligence. Another well-known example involved then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in a video that  to make it sound as if she was slurring her words.\nThe misleading content of the social media posts dovetails with one of the nicknames, “Sleepy Joe,” that former President Donald Trump has used for Biden.\nRepublicans aiming to defeat Biden in next year’s presidential election have often focused on signs of his age, a concern that’s widespread . Biden, 80, has responded by increasingly  about his age, while his advisers appear to be taking steps to minimize the job’s physical toll, including .\nTrump, 77, has a wide lead in  and  over other Republicans for the party’s presidential nomination, although resistance  remains.\nThe posts about Biden’s visit to Maui are the latest attempt by right-wing media to bend the rules of social media platforms, especially tech billionaire Elon Musk’s X app. Last month, conservative pundits spread  about the drowning death of the Obama family’s personal chef.\nAlthough Musk has changed many of X’s rules since he bought it last year, X’s website still has a written policy .\nX didn’t immediately respond to an email request for comment about the Hannity video. Fox News, on which Hannity has a show, also didn’t immediately respond to an email request. Hannity also didn’t immediately respond to a reply to his X post.\nSeveral videos on YouTube used the lower-resolution video to allege that Biden fell asleep. One, from pundit Tim Pool, had 116,000 views; another, from The Hill...[Content truncated]"

            "content": "[Content truncated]... to cover it up, the former president kept arguing that it would be unfair to prosecute him given that President Joe Biden took “1,850 boxes” of documents to the University of Delaware. \n    \n\n            Trump used the words “1,850 boxes” three times at a CNN town hall in May, adding two references to “1,800” boxes for good measure. Trump made similar comments on Thursday after learning he was being indicted by a federal grand jury, posting on social media that “Joe Biden has 1850 Boxes at the University of Delaware.”\n    \n\n            But Trump’s vague insinuations that there is something improper about the existence of the Biden collection at the University of Delaware are baseless. The collection of donated documents is from Biden’s 36-year tenure as a US senator for Delaware. Unlike presidents, who are subject to the Presidential Records Act, senators own their offices’ documents and can do whatever they want with them – donate them to colleges, keep them at their homes, give them to journalists, even throw them in the trash.\n    \n\n            “No statute governs their retention or disposition and there is no public right of access to congressional records, under FOIA or any other statute,” Margaret Kwoka, a law professor at The Ohio State University and an expert on information law, said in a Friday email.\n    \n\n            Trump has also made false specific claims about the boxes of Biden’s Senate documents. It is not true that “nobody even knows where they are.” It is public knowledge that these documents are stored at his alma mater. It is also not true that Biden “has been totally uncooperative” and “won’t show the documents under any circumstances.” Biden consented to two FBI searches at the university – searches that did not initially appear to turn up any documents with classified markings, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN’s Paula Reid in February, though they were still being analyzed at the time.\n    \n\n            Here’s a more detailed look at the facts about the documents at the University of Delaware.\n    \n\n            The approximately 1,850 boxes of Biden documents at the University of Delaware are papers from the president’s Senate career, which ran from 1973 to 2009 (when Biden was sworn in as vice president). While the Presidential Records Act says that presidential records belong to the public and that the National Archives and Records Administration gets custody of them the moment the president leaves office, records that are created and maintained within a senator’s office “are the property of the senator,” the Senate website explains. \n    \n\n            And...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What sources confirmed the misrepresentation of the Trump video and how widely has this misinformation spread?",
        "Answer": "The misrepresentation of the video claiming to show President Trump visiting Maui after the August 2023 wildfires has been confirmed by multiple sources. The key points include: 1. **Fact-Check Reports**: Various fact-checking organizations have debunked the claims circulating on social media. They confirmed that the video in question is an old clip from 2019, depicting Trump in Alabama following a tornado, not a recent response to the wildfires in Maui. This misinformation has been widely distributed through social media, leading many viewers to assume it was a current event connected to the wildfires. 2. **Historical Context and Social Media Dynamics**: Misinformation regarding public figures often spreads rapidly, especially during significant events like natural disasters. Reports indicate that misleading videos and posts have circulated extensively, fueled by narratives aligned with political discourse. As such, the misinformation about Trump’s alleged visit intertwines with ongoing political campaigns and narratives prevalent in social media. 3. **Media and Political Analysts**: Commentary from various media outlets and pundits highlights the trend of political misinformation, particularly in the context of electoral politics and how it skews public perception. Higher engagement on social media platforms has exacerbated the issue, particularly during election cycles as users share selective clips without verifying their authenticity. Overall, this misinformation about Trump’s visit to Maui is a significant example of how old footage can be misrepresented and spread widely, especially amidst political competition and disaster recovery narratives. The push for clarity and fact-checking from media organizations is crucial in addressing and correcting these narratives.",
