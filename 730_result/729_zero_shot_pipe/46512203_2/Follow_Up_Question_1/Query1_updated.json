Unlike presidents, who are subject to the Presidential Records Act, senators own their offices\u2019 documents and can do whatever they want with them \u2013 donate them to colleges, keep them at their homes, give them to journalists, even throw them in the trash.\n    \n\n            \u201cNo statute governs their retention or disposition and there is no public right of access to congressional records, under FOIA or any other statute,\u201d Margaret Kwoka, a law professor at The Ohio State University and an expert on information law, said in a Friday email.\n    \n\n            Trump has also made false specific claims about the boxes of Biden\u2019s Senate documents. It is not true that \u201cnobody even knows where they are.\u201d It is public knowledge that these documents are stored at his alma mater. It is also not true that Biden \u201chas been totally uncooperative\u201d and \u201cwon\u2019t show the documents under any circumstances.\u201d Biden consented to two FBI searches at the university \u2013 searches that did not initially appear to turn up any documents with classified markings, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN\u2019s Paula Reid in February, though they were still being analyzed at the time.\n    \n\n            Here\u2019s a more detailed look at the facts about the documents at the University of Delaware.\n    \n\n            The approximately 1,850 boxes of Biden documents at the University of Delaware are papers from the president\u2019s Senate career, which ran from 1973 to 2009 (when Biden was sworn in as vice president). While the Presidential Records Act says that presidential records belong to the public and that the National Archives and Records Administration gets custody of them the moment the president leaves office, records that are created and maintained within a senator\u2019s office \u201care the property of the senator,\u201d the Senate website explains. \n    \n\n            And...[Content truncated]",
