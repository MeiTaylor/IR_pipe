Hundreds more are missing. \nWhile some reported receiving text alerts, it is unclear why the warnings were not more widespread. Many residents have reported that strong winds knocked out communications systems hours before the fires arrived. \nHere's what we know. \nWe know now that the fires began on Tuesday, but there was no specific warning ahead of it. \nThe National Weather Service did issue a number of warnings for strong winds and dry weather that can help fuel wildfires. But that warning was cancelled on Wednesday.\nSoon after flames were reported on Maui on the morning of 8 August, officials ordered an evacuation order of an area near a school to the east of Lahaina. \nShortly before 0900 local time (2000 BST), Maui County's official website put out a statement in which they said that the brush fire had been \"100% contained\", although \"winds in the area remain a concern\". \nApart from a warning to avoid blocked roads, officials gave no further warnings regarding Lahaina until 16:45 local time, when the county said \"an apparent flare-up\" of the fire had caused the closure of a bypass near the town, as well as some evacuations. \nMore evacuations were announced later that afternoon, followed by an emergency declaration by Mayor Richard Bissen before 2200 local time that night. Tourists in some hotels were instructed to remain in place to avoid clogging up local roads. \nBy then, flames had already engulfed parts of Lahaina, forcing some residents to flee into the sea. \nHawaii has what officials have previously touted as the world's largest all-hazard public warning system, which includes a network of over 400 sirens across the state's many islands that can help alert residents and visitors to various kinds of threats. Eighty outdoor sirens are in Maui alone. \nThe head of the state's emergency management agency, Adam Weintraub, told the Associated Press this week that records do not suggest that those sirens were triggered on Maui on Tuesday. \nInstead, Mr Weintraub said, officials used emergency alerts sent to mobile phones as well as TVs and radio stations. \nIn the wake of the fire, many residents have reported not seeing these, prompting speculation that they came only after widespread power and communications outages occurred on Maui. \nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday night, fire chief Bradford Ventura said that the flames...[Content truncated]",
