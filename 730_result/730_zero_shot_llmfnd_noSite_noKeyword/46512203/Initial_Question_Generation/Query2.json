Climate change coverage has progressed leaps and bounds in recent years. Newsrooms have become far more cognizant about tying extreme weather events, like flash flooding and heat waves, to the larger trend. But still, there is considerable room for improvement.\n An aerial image taken on August 10, 2023 shows a person walking down Front Street past destroyed buildings burned to the ground in Lahaina in the aftermath of wildfires in western Maui, Hawaii. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images How a devastating combination of conditions triggered America's deadliest wildfire in more than a century]\n“Especially in the United States, most TV news reports on the ferocious heat and other weather extremes afflicting millions of people this summer have not even mentioned the words ‘climate change,’” Hertsgaard said. “The science is unequivocal on that connection and leaving it out leaves audiences not just uninformed but misinformed.”\nThe unprecedented wind-whipped wildfire that devastated the island of Maui last week, killing more than 100 people, has received high volumes of attention from major media outlets, which have gone to remarkable lengths to gather reporting from the scene. But,  from the progressive watchdog Media Matters, only 4% of television news segments about the disaster, during a two-day period starting on August 9, tied the catastrophe to climate change.\nMore alarmingly, perhaps, of the only eight segments that mentioned climate change during this particular window on television, all of them came from CNN and MSNBC. CNN mentioned climate change three times and MSNBC five times, according to Media Matters. ABC News, CBS News, and NBC News did not tie the fires to climate change in any of the 35 segments that aired. (Of course, it’s worth noting that many of these outlets have been drawing this connection on their digital platforms.)\nMichael Mann, the presidential distinguished professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science at the University of Pennsylvania, told Reliable Sources that he fears news organizations do not cover the climate crisis enough, outside extreme weather events.\n“Many media outlets still treat climate as a niche issue, giving it very little coverage except when an unprecedented bout of...[Content truncated]",

While the rest of the GOP field prepares for the first primary debate, the Trump team is already pivoting to a general election posture toward paid media, according to a person familiar with the super PAC’s strategy. MAGA Inc. is spending $1 million to air the new 30-second spot this week on Fox News, CNN and Newsmax, now up to a total of $3 million hitting the president since Aug. 7.\n**As for those anti-RON DeSANTIS ads that they ran for months?** The super PAC hasn’t aired one since June 22, while the Florida governor has continued to bleed support.

And just in case Team DeSantis tries to deny it, there’s this little detail: **_They actually wrote the policy down_** — and WaPo comes with receipts.\n**Just look at this quote:** **_“I could sell golf for $50k this morning.”_** That’s **HEATHER BARKER**, a top DeSantis aide/fundraiser, boasting in a 2019 email to other DeSantis aides about a wealthy lobbyist willing to pay top dollar to play a round with the then-newly elected governor and his wife, **CASEY DeSANTIS**.\n**But there’s plenty more where that came from:** According to the story, “to help them haul in large sums of money, the document \\ suggested that lobbyists be allowed to...[Content truncated]",
