Hundreds more are missing. \nWhile some reported receiving text alerts, it is unclear why the warnings were not more widespread. Many residents have reported that strong winds knocked out communications systems hours before the fires arrived. \nHere's what we know. \nWe know now that the fires began on Tuesday, but there was no specific warning ahead of it. \nThe National Weather Service did issue a number of warnings for strong winds and dry weather that can help fuel wildfires. But that warning was cancelled on Wednesday.\nSoon after flames were reported on Maui on the morning of 8 August, officials ordered an evacuation order of an area near a school to the east of Lahaina. \nShortly before 0900 local time (2000 BST), Maui County's official website put out a statement in which they said that the brush fire had been \"100% contained\", although \"winds in the area remain a concern\". \nApart from a warning to avoid blocked roads, officials gave no further warnings regarding Lahaina until 16:45 local time, when the county said \"an apparent flare-up\" of the fire had caused the closure of a bypass near the town, as well as some evacuations. \nMore evacuations were announced later that afternoon, followed by an emergency declaration by Mayor Richard Bissen before 2200 local time that night. Tourists in some hotels were instructed to remain in place to avoid clogging up local roads. \nBy then, flames had already engulfed parts of Lahaina, forcing some residents to flee into the sea. \nHawaii has what officials have previously touted as the world's largest all-hazard public warning system, which includes a network of over 400 sirens across the state's many islands that can help alert residents and visitors to various kinds of threats. Eighty outdoor sirens are in Maui alone. \nThe head of the state's emergency management agency, Adam Weintraub, told the Associated Press this week that records do not suggest that those sirens were triggered on Maui on Tuesday. \nInstead, Mr Weintraub said, officials used emergency alerts sent to mobile phones as well as TVs and radio stations. \nIn the wake of the fire, many residents have reported not seeing these, prompting speculation that they came only after widespread power and communications outages occurred on Maui. \nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday night, fire chief Bradford Ventura said that the flames...[Content truncated]",

Climate change coverage has progressed leaps and bounds in recent years. Newsrooms have become far more cognizant about tying extreme weather events, like flash flooding and heat waves, to the larger trend. But still, there is considerable room for improvement.\n An aerial image taken on August 10, 2023 shows a person walking down Front Street past destroyed buildings burned to the ground in Lahaina in the aftermath of wildfires in western Maui, Hawaii. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images How a devastating combination of conditions triggered America's deadliest wildfire in more than a century]\n“Especially in the United States, most TV news reports on the ferocious heat and other weather extremes afflicting millions of people this summer have not even mentioned the words ‘climate change,’” Hertsgaard said. “The science is unequivocal on that connection and leaving it out leaves audiences not just uninformed but misinformed.”\nThe unprecedented wind-whipped wildfire that devastated the island of Maui last week, killing more than 100 people, has received high volumes of attention from major media outlets, which have gone to remarkable lengths to gather reporting from the scene. But,  from the progressive watchdog Media Matters, only 4% of television news segments about the disaster, during a two-day period starting on August 9, tied the catastrophe to climate change.\nMore alarmingly, perhaps, of the only eight segments that mentioned climate change during this particular window on television, all of them came from CNN and MSNBC. CNN mentioned climate change three times and MSNBC five times, according to Media Matters. ABC News, CBS News, and NBC News did not tie the fires to climate change in any of the 35 segments that aired. (Of course, it’s worth noting that many of these outlets have been drawing this connection on their digital platforms.)\nMichael Mann, the presidential distinguished professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science at the University of Pennsylvania, told Reliable Sources that he fears news organizations do not cover the climate crisis enough, outside extreme weather events.\n“Many media outlets still treat climate as a niche issue, giving it very little coverage except when an unprecedented bout of...[Content truncated]",

            "content": "[Content truncated]....\nLocal evacuations first took place on Tuesday, followed by an announcement that the flames were \"100% contained\". \nBy the following day, however, fast-moving flames had engulfed Maui's Lahaina town. \nAbout 80% of the town has been destroyed, according to officials. \nAt least 96 have been reported dead in Maui County. Hundreds more are missing. \nWhile some reported receiving text alerts, it is unclear why the warnings were not more widespread. Many residents have reported that strong winds knocked out communications systems hours before the fires arrived. \nHere's what we know. \nWe know now that the fires began on Tuesday, but there was no specific warning ahead of it. \nThe National Weather Service did issue a number of warnings for strong winds and dry weather that can help fuel wildfires. But that warning was cancelled on Wednesday.\nSoon after flames were reported on Maui on the morning of 8 August, officials ordered an evacuation order of an area near a school to the east of Lahaina. \nShortly before 0900 local time (2000 BST), Maui County's official website put out a statement in which they said that the brush fire had been \"100% contained\", although \"winds in the area remain a concern\". \nApart from a warning to avoid blocked roads, officials gave no further warnings regarding Lahaina until 16:45 local time, when the county said \"an apparent flare-up\" of the fire had caused the closure of a bypass near the town, as well as some evacuations. \nMore evacuations were announced later that afternoon, followed by an emergency declaration by Mayor Richard Bissen before 2200 local time that night. Tourists in some hotels were instructed to remain in place to avoid clogging up local roads. \nBy then, flames had already engulfed parts of Lahaina, forcing some residents to flee into the sea. \nHawaii has what officials have previously touted as the world's largest all-hazard public warning system, which includes a network of over 400 sirens across the state's many islands that can help alert residents and visitors to various kinds of threats. Eighty outdoor sirens are in Maui alone. \nThe head of the state's emergency management agency, Adam Weintraub, told the Associated Press this week that records do not suggest that those sirens were triggered on Maui on Tuesday. \nInstead, Mr Weintraub said, officials used emergency alerts sent to mobile phones as well as TVs and radio stations. \nIn the wake of the fire, many residents have reported not seeing these, prompting speculation that they came only after widespread power and communications outages occurred on Maui. \nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday night, fire chief Bradford Ventura said that the flames...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "Is there verified evidence confirming that Donald Trump visited Maui after the August 2023 wildfires?",
        "Answer": "There is no verified evidence confirming that Donald Trump visited Maui after the August 2023 wildfires. A Trump campaign spokesperson explicitly stated that the claims of Trump's visit are \"completely fabricated\". Furthermore, news reports concerning the aftermath of the wildfires do not mention any visit by Trump, instead focusing on the responses to the disaster and the challenges faced by the residents of Maui. Given the strong denial from Trump's spokesperson and the absence of any confirmed sightings or reports detailing Trump's presence in Maui, I would rate the confidence in my answer at 95%. This high level of confidence is based on direct evidence from a credible source and the lack of supporting evidence for the claim of Trump's visit.",
