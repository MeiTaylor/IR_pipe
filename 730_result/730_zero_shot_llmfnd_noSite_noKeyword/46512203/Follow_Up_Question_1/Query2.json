A 9-year-old video was altered to add the laser beam. An  of the same footage can be seen in news reports from 2014 about an explosion at a gas station in Makhachkala, a southwestern Russian city on the Caspian Sea. Lasers powerful enough to start such a fire could not be seen by the naked eye, as they use infrared technology, an aerospace engineering expert told The Associated Press.\nTHE FACTS: In the aftermath of the , social media users have shared altered and miscaptioned images, falsely claiming they prove a   that the fires were started by a directed-energy weapon. As these posts circulated, a video shared on Instagram claimed to show such a weapon being used.\nThe video shows what appears to be a red laser beam shooting down from the sky and starting a fire in front of a gas station, which explodes seconds later. Captions on the video read, “LASER BEAM WEAPON” and “RED LASER BEAM ATTACK?”\nRELATED COVERAGE\n      ]\n      ]\n      ]\nOne post that shared the video wrote: “This is how it looks to see DEWs in action.”\n“DEW” stands for directed-energy weapon.

That includes “high energy lasers and other high power electromagnetics.”\nBut the laser beam in the video being shared online was edited into the footage. It does not appear in an  posted on YouTube in August 2014 by Russian media outlet RIA Dagestan. The fire and resulting explosion, however, do materialize.\nThe outlet  that the incident occurred on Aug. 8, 2014, in Makhachk...[Content truncated]",

The original image - of the Waiola Church in Lahaina in flames on 8 August - has no laser beam or ray of light visible.\nTwo other false images have been racking up huge numbers of views.\nOne shows a fireball and a bright streak of light rising up towards the night sky. It, too, has been accompanied by claims that wildfires are not a natural phenomenon. \nBut a search on the internet for previous versions of this image reveals the photo shows a controlled burn at an Ohio oil refinery and was first posted online in January 2018. The streak of light, known as a \"light pillar\", is an optical illusion formed by reflections off ice crystals on a cold day...[Content truncated]",

Troy Nehls, R-Texas, also shared the lower-resolution version on X.\nA spokesperson for Nehls said in a statement: “Everyone with eyes can draw their own conclusion about whether President Biden was nodding off in the video.”\nAsked for comment about the Maui videos, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in an email: “It’s unfortunate they feel the need to lie. Instead, they should join him in supporting the people of Maui.”\nThe posts on the country’s largest social media platforms, which largely appear to be spreading unchecked, are the latest test of how Silicon Valley will handle misinformation in the 2024 election cycle — and whether it will enforce its own policies.\nLow-quality videos are an example of what some misinformation researchers call “”: media that can mislead people through simple techniques, even amid growing concerns about more advanced ways to create misleading content through generative artificial intelligence.

Fox News, on which Hannity has a show, also didn’t immediately respond to an email request. Hannity also didn’t immediately respond to a reply to his X post.\nSeveral videos on YouTube used the lower-resolution video to allege that Biden fell asleep.

We’re told the Harris campaign is expected to announce their own large media buy later this morning, coming on the heels of a $50 million commitment last week from the Future Forward super PAC.
