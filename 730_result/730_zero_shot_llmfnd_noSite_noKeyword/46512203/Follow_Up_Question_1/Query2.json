A 9-year-old video was altered to add the laser beam. An  of the same footage can be seen in news reports from 2014 about an explosion at a gas station in Makhachkala, a southwestern Russian city on the Caspian Sea.

The original image - of the Waiola Church in Lahaina in flames on 8 August - has no laser beam or ray of light visible.\nTwo other false images have been racking up huge numbers of views.\nOne shows a fireball and a bright streak of light rising up towards the night sky. It, too, has been accompanied by claims that wildfires are not a natural phenomenon. \nBut a search on the internet for previous versions of this image reveals the photo shows a controlled burn at an Ohio oil refinery and was first posted online in January 2018. The streak of light, known as a \"light pillar\", is an optical illusion formed by reflections off ice crystals on a cold day...[Content truncated]",

Whatâs conspicuously not included are suggestions that sheâs a âDEI hire,â allegations she covered up Bidenâs mental state, clips of her laughing, mentions of Venn diagrams or any of the other attacks that have gone viral among the MAGA faithful but do little to move the needle among a broader audience.\n**Trump wonât have the airwaves to himself** this week, of course. Weâre told the Harris campaign is expected to announce their own large media buy later this morning, coming on the heels of a $50 million commitment last week from the Future Forward super PAC. Expect to see upbeat, biographical efforts to reintroduce the VP as the new Democratic standard-bearer.\n**But Trump insiders arenât fretting.** Far from it, according to our conversations last night with senior GOP officials, who remain confident that the sheen surrounding Harris will soon fade and their attacks on her record will sink in with critical swing voters.\n**âSo Harris has a good week** because Democrats are in such disarray that they had to force the sitting president to no longer run for president?â one of those officials sarcastically asked. âHas the Democratic base coalesced?
