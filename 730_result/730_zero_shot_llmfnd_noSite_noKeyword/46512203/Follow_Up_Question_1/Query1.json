So far, Democrats have publicly supported Biden’s response. The president has been in regular contact with Hawaii Gov. Josh Green,  the administration’s response and the president’s “full support.” Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii also thanked Biden for his speed approving a federal disaster declaration during an appearance of CNN’s “State of the Union” as she described her experience witnessing the wildfires’ devastation.\nThat included a photo Biden tweeted from aboard Air Force One speaking by phone with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell and Green, maps and binders spread out before him on his desk.\nDuring his remarks, Biden pledged that the state would have “every asset, every asset they need” for ongoing recovery and rebuild efforts.\nThe president mourned the loss of life and “generations of native Hawaiian history turned into ruin” while reiterating a robust federal response, even as some on Maui have voiced frustration at the slow pace of aid.\n“You always hear this phrase, and I’ve been to so many disasters in my career, it...[Content truncated]",

Maui's emergency management chief resigned last week after the agency faced backlash for failing to activate its alarm system in the wake of the fire. \nTo date, 27 of the deceased have been identified and 11 families had been notified, Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen said earlier on Monday...[Content truncated]",

Nearly 500 federal workers are deployed in Hawaii. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has provided 50,000 meals, 75,000 liters of water, 5,000 cots and 10,000 blankets. The Coast Guard and the Navy’s 3rd Fleet supported response efforts, and the Marines provided Black Hawk helicopters to fight fires.\nBiden has also spoken with Gov. Josh Green, Sens. Mazie Hirono and Brian Schatz, Hawaii Democrats and other officials.\nHirono, whose office didn’t respond to a request for comment, has defended the White House's response to the fires,  that she was \"glad to see so many on the right are so concerned about what’s happening in Hawaii\" and asking Republicans to support more funding.\nResidents said over the weekend that they were getting more help from volunteers than from the government,  .\n“We won’t be lectured by Republican officials in Washington who are doubling down on denial of the climate crisis that is devastating red and blue states, who attempted to slash the wildfire response budget, and who defended the Trump administration cutting Puerto Rico off from hurricane relief,” said Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman.\nWith the death toll expected to continue to climb, Biden flew to the 2024 battleground state of Wisconsin on Tuesday to mark the first anniversary of an ambitious climate change package that is central to his campaign message.

I’ve been to too many disaster areas,”  of the considerations that go into making the trip. “But I want to go and make sure we got everything they need. I want to be sure we don’t disrupt the ongoing recovery efforts.”\nCritics have seized on what they see as a potential vulnerability.\nThe Republican National Committee sent out an email Monday with a picture of Biden sitting in a beach chair in a sandy stretch of Delaware while “Hawaiians are left to fend for themselves.”\nDoug Heye, a former RNC official, said Biden’s relative silence was “surprising” and “disappointing.”\nBiden had “always been portrayed as somebody who would be a great consoler-in-chief,” Heye said. “And, you know, here we have the deadliest wildfire in our nation’s history, and he’s been silent.”\nHaving lost a wife and a daughter in a car crash and a son to cancer, Biden has embraced the role of soothing those who are in pain, invoking his own...[Content truncated]",

You’ve got Tim Scott. You’ve got Mike Pence. They all voted to raise the debt. And Donald Trump added 8 trillion to our debt,” Haley said.\nScott is a South Carolina senator, DeSantis a former Florida representative and Pence a former congressman from Indiana.\nHaley said, “So, you tell me. Who are the big spenders? I think it’s time for an accountant in the White House.”\nIt was Donald Trump’s famous line on “The Apprentice,” but at the debate, “You’re fired!” was taken over by one of his top GOP challengers.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said that “a major reason” for America’s current struggles is “because how this federal government handled COVID-19 by locking down this economy.”\nDeSantis, who has talked often on the campaign trail about how he “kept Florida open” during the pandemic, said at the debate that, “As your president, I will never let the deep state bureaucrats lock you down.”\nOf Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert during the pandemic, DeSantis said, “You don’t take somebody like Fauci and coddle him.

Chris Christie, who has promised to build his presidential run around stopping Trump, giving a lengthy answer defending his own record in his home state.\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence defended the record of the “Trump-Pence administration” and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis took a page from Trump’s political playbook by pledging to fire Dr. Anthony Fauci, drawing applause from the crowd in Milwaukee.\nBut most of the early debate focused on the candidates on stage ripping President Joe Biden and his administration’s economic policies.\nVivek Ramaswamy emerged as a popular target early in the debate, drawing cheers from the audience when he introduced himself.\n“Let me just address a question that is on everybody’s mind at home tonight,” the biotech entrepreneur said. “Who the heck is this skinny guy with a funny last name...[Content truncated]",
