He may believe that the closer the relationship becomes between himself and Kim, the more eager South Korean policymakers will be to maintain dialogue with Russia. It was this logic that in the late 1980s led the South Korean president, Roh Tae-woo, to launch the policy of _nordpolitik_ \u2013 reaching out to Moscow to put pressure on Pyongyang. In fact, Putin\u2019s courting of North Korea early in his own presidency followed exactly this logic.\n North Korea will \u2018pay a price\u2019 if it supplies arms to Russia, says US Read more]\nThe third consideration that may weigh on Putin\u2019s mind is whether North Korea is a trustworthy partner. In fact, it most certainly is not. Pyongyang spent the cold war exploiting disagreements among its allies and playing them off against one another. It proved notoriously wilful and unpredictable and, on more than one occasion (for instance, during its 1968 capture of the USS Pueblo and its 1969 downing of a US EC-121 surveillance plane), pulled tricks that could have dragged Moscow into an unwanted confrontation with the US.\nNorth Korea is also well known for becoming an economic burden on its reluctant friends and partners. What bargain Kim will attempt to drive with Russia is still unknown, but he is unlikely to sell himself cheaply.\nDespite these considerations, Putin may well have already made the strategic choice to draw closer to North Korea. This is in part the consequence of the new situation Russia finds itself in. The demise of the post-cold war world and the return of bloc mentality tend to encourage these kinds of realignments. The elephant in the room is Pyongyang\u2019s longtime sponsor China, which has also been drawing closer to Russia by the logic of its own deepening conflict with the US. The last time these three countries were on the same wavelength was in the late 1940s to early 1950s, which cannot be described as a happy time for north-east Asia.\nIt is as yet unclear whether Kim will meet Putin, but the relationship between their countries is clearly shifting. And not because North Korea is changing, but because Russia is. It is beginning to look more and more like North Korea. Whether or not North Korean armaments find their way to the frontlines in Ukraine, Russia\u2019s descent into the depths of tyranny will put a smile of satisfaction on Kim\u2019s face.\n*   Sergey Radchenko is Wilson E Schmidt distinguished professor at the Henry A Kissinger Center, Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies\nExplore more on these topics\n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n*   \n...[Content truncated]",
