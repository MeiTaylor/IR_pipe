With Russia’s vaunted military machine having been proved something of a paper tiger by the Ukrainians, there is an implied humiliation in shopping around for weapons in places like North Korea, a disdained client state at the best of times. There are also important practical considerations that Putin must weigh before embracing Kim.\n!\n‘Kim Jong-un was seen proudly showing Sergei Shoigu around the latest models of North Korean weaponry. Amid the smiles and camaraderie, a new relationship was being born.’ Photograph: EyePress News/Shutterstock\nThe first – violating the sanctions regime that Russia has helped built up over the years – is probably the least of Putin’s hurdles. Now that Russia itself has become a pariah state, on the receiving end of extensive western sanctions, it is only reasonable that the Kremlin might reach out to fellow rogues. You may argue, of course, that the (partial) dismantling of the sanctions regime will bury all hopes for Pyongyang’s denuclearisation, a goal to which the Kremlin is, in theory, still committed. But Putin may well decide that this is the least of his problems at this time.\nThe second consideration is potentially more important. By overdoing North Korea, the Kremlin risks undermining its relationship with South Korea. Granted, the war in  has taken a toll on this relationship already, as Seoul joined western sanctions against Russia. South Korea’s exports to Russia plummeted by 37% in 2022 (imports decreased by 15%). But Seoul joined these sanctions only reluctantly, and many South Korean companies continue operating in Russia. South Korea is something of a weak link in the western sanctions front, a situation the Kremlin could exploit to its advantage if it had the tactical acumen to do so.\nPutin may conclude, however, that by forging a new relationship with Pyongyang he could increase his leverage with South Korea. He may believe that the closer the relationship becomes between himself and Kim, the more eager South Korean policymakers will be to maintain dialogue with Russia. It was this logic that in the late 1980s led the South Korean president, Roh Tae-woo, to launch the policy of _nordpolitik_ – reaching out to Moscow to put pressure on Pyongyang. In fact, Putin’s courting of North Korea early in his own presidency followed exactly this logic.\nThe third consideration that may weigh on Putin’s mind...[Content truncated]",
