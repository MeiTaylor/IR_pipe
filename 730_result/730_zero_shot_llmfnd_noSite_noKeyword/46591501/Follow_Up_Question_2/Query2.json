Thank God there is such a service; bless Maté for his work there. (Disclosure: I visited and conducted workshops at Insite and PHS in January.)\nMaté maintains a human communion with his patients. He does so by describing his own maladies, his ADD and shopping addiction, which he analogizes to severe drug addictions. Fair enough. It _is_ important to recognize our common humanity (although some think that as a successful middle-class physician Maté is stretching this connection). But, for Maté, they are all brain diseases.\nBeyond this, Maté has a theory of addiction rooted in  abuse. Maté combines his clinical experiences with brain research claiming the source of addiction is in formative brain chemicals. For Maté, the first five years of life (and even  in the womb) dictate the likelihood of addiction. He then relates this theoretical point of view to studies connecting , abuse and lack of love and  to not only life problems (as they have been for some time) but to deficiencies in people's ability to process endorphins and —the neurochemicals in our bodies that provide us with both pleasure and pain relief.\nMaté then claims that addiction results from deficiencies (lack of receptors) in these neuro-systems that cause people with addictions to self-medicate to replace their missing neurostimulation. In this sense, people are addicted to drugs as replacements for the brain chemicals their own bodies fail to process. Those addicted to things other than drugs are reacting to the same internal chemistry, but with different external stimulants.\nIt is important to respect Maté's work with individuals living with addictions. For this reason, people who work with clients from a  perspective—that is, they accept people as they are, and seek to help those in need...[Content truncated]",

He took to singing Jailhouse Rock at the top of his voice with all the low crooning and pelvis-jiggling of the King himself. One day, as I tucked him in, he looked at me very earnestly and asked: “Johann, will you take me to Graceland one day?” Without really thinking, I agreed. I never gave it another thought, until everything had gone wrong.\nTen years later, Adam was lost. He had dropped out of school when he was 15, and he spent almost all his waking hours alternating blankly between screens – a blur of YouTube, WhatsApp and porn. (I’ve changed his name and some minor details to preserve his privacy.) He seemed to be whirring at the speed of Snapchat, and nothing still or serious could gain any traction in his mind. During the decade in which Adam had become a man, this fracturing seemed to be happening to many of us. Our ability to pay attention was cracking and breaking. I had just turned 40, and wherever my generation gathered, we would lament our lost capacity for concentration. I still read a lot of books, but with each year that passed, it felt more and more like running up a down escalator. Then one evening, as we lay on my sofa, each staring at our own ceaselessly shrieking screens, I looked at him and felt a low dread. “Adam,” I said softly, “let’s go to Graceland.” I reminded him of the promise I had made. I could see that the idea of breaking this numbing routine ignited something in him, but I told him there was one condition he had to stick to if we went. He had to switch his phone off during the day. He swore he would.\nWhen you arrive at the gates of Graceland, there is no longer a human being whose job is to show you around. You are handed an iPad, you put in little earbuds, and the iPad tells you what to do – turn left; turn right; walk forward. In each room, a photograph of where you are appears on the screen, while a narrator describes it. So as we walked around we were surrounded by blank-faced people, looking almost all the time at their...[Content truncated]",

He also reminded the audience that “TED can’t shy away from controversy on issues that matter so much”—a statement I very much agreed with and appreciated. Because he said as much, I left the conference fairly confident that TED would release and promote my talk just like any other, in spite of the staff and audience members who were upset by it.\nTwo weeks later, Anderson emailed to tell me that there was “blowback” on my talk and that “\\ome internally are arguing we shouldn’t post it.” In the email, he told me that the “most challenging” blowback had come from a “well-known” social scientist (who I later learned was ). He quoted from Grant’s message directly:\n> _Really glad to see TED offering viewpoint diversity—we need more conservative voices—but as a social scientist, was dismayed to see Coleman Hughes deliver an inaccurate message._\n> \n> _His case for color blindness is directly contradicted by an extensive body of rigorous research; for the state of the science, see Leslie, Bono, Kim & Beaver (2020, Journal of Applied Psychology). In a meta-analysis of 296 studies, they found that whereas color-conscious models reduce prejudice and discrimination, color-blind approaches often fail to help and sometimes backfire._\nI read the  that Grant referenced, titled “On Melting Pots and Salad Bowls: A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Identity-Blind and Identity-Conscious Diversity Ideologies,” expecting to find arguments against color blindness. I was shocked to find that the paper largely supported my talk. In the results section, the authors write that “colorblindness is negatively related to stereotyping” and “is also negatively related to prejudice.” They also found that “meritocracy is negatively related to discrimination.”\nI wrote back to Anderson:\n> _Far from a refutation of my talk, this meta-analysis is closer to an endorsement of it._\n> \n> _The only anti–color blindness finding in the paper is that color blindness & meritocracy are associated with opposing DEI policies. Well, I do oppose race-based DEI policies in most (but not all) cases. Unapologetically. But that is a philosophical disagreement, not an example of me delivering incorrect social science._\n> \n> _I feel it would be unjustified not to release my talk simply because many people disagree with my philosophical perspective. By that standard, most TED talks would never get released._\nTo which...[Content truncated]",

He is the author of “” and the host of the TED podcast “.”\nIt’s been two decades, but I still feel jittery when I think of an old boss of mine. One day she nominated me for an award for service to the organization. Then she threatened to fire me for raising a concern about a colleague being mistreated. “If you ever speak up out of turn again,” she said, “I’ll have you fired.” I walked on eggshells until the day she quit.\nWe often think about relationships on a spectrum from positive to negative. We gravitate toward loving family members, caring classmates and supportive mentors. We do our best to avoid the cruel uncle, the playground bully and the jerk boss.\nBut the most toxic relationships aren’t the purely negative ones. They’re the ones that are a mix of positive and negative.\nWe often call them frenemies, supposed friends who sometimes help you and sometimes hurt you. But it’s not just friends. It’s the in-laws who volunteer to watch your kids but belittle your parenting. The roommate who gets you through a breakup and then starts dating your ex. The manager who praises your work but denies you a promotion.\nEveryone knows how...[Content truncated]",

                    "content": "In 2010, researchers from Columbia and Harvard Universities examined whether brief postural adjustments – 'power poses' – could produce positive psychological, behavioural and hormonal outcomes. Their experiment revealed an emphatic 'yes' on all three questions, with the everyday implications clearly apparent. Stressful interpersonal contexts, such as job interviews, presentations and important meetings, could be helped through preparatory postural adjustment.\nAs the decade progressed, power posing became an idea whose time had come; , widespread organisational acceptance and a number of eye-catching interpretations by leading politicians. Despite this widening embrace, deeper academic questions emerged. Replication attempts did not reproduce the complete breadth of original results, and by 2016 power posing was firmly embroiled in the 'replication crisis' affecting social psychology.\nBut power posing would not go away. Larger quantitative examinations of its evidentiary credentials have suggested that significant benefits do remain… though with some caveats. With a recent systematic review and meta-analysis shedding further light on how postures can affect our emotions and behaviours, it is time to reflect on power posing's chequered first decade. Where it came from, where it now stands … and where to next?\nOrigins\n-------\nWithin social psychology, research into embodiment and embodied cognition explores how our postures and bodily movements can influence our emotional states (Veenstra et al., 2017). Its lineage can be traced back to the ideomotor action ideas of 19th century philosopher and psychologist William James, who asserted that emotions arise from physiology, so that bodily expressions contributed to the consequent feeling of emotions (James, 1950). In more recent times, embodiment has provided a rich terrain for exploration. The manipulation of facial expressions, voice management, breathing and posture can induce diverse emotional feelings, including happiness, sadness, anger and fear (Laird & Lacasse, 2013).\nPhysical posture has provided a particularly insightful lens for examining feelings of power – and powerlessness – across both human and animal studies (Ellyson & Dovidio, 1985; Huang et al., 2011). And referencing the gamut of postural research literature, three researchers from Columbia and Harvard Universities – Dana Carney, Amy Cuddy and Andy Yap – put forward an elegantly simple question in the September 2010 issue of _Psychological Science_: Can posed displays cause a person to feel more powerful?\nPower posing is born\n--------------------\nThe researchers identified two distinct nonverbal dimensions universally associated with demonstration – and...[Content truncated]",

But part of me knew, you can’t just do it post hoc.\nI somehow sort of persuaded myself that, well, you can justify this. It was only because I was so desperate to get a job because I failed to get a job my first time on the job market. And so my whole career was on the line. I’ll cut out these two outliers, and I didn’t feel right about it. And I thought, but okay, I’m not going to write this paper up. I’m not going to submit it. Let me run more. Let me collect more subjects, to be sure about this. So I collected more subjects, and I didn’t get the effect. So I dropped that line. But I felt I did feel it. I was kind of aware that I was aware that I was doing it and it felt wrong. But I did it anyway for at least a few weeks.\r\nI think that actually now that you mentioned it that might be that that incident actually could well be part of why I in particular and treating truth as sacred. I think more so than then some other people in the academy.\nElizabeth  \nHelpful. Well, lots to come back to there. But first I want to wind back to the beginning of your story and just locate you and where you where you came from. So I’d love you to tell me a little bit about your childhood and particular the big ideas that were in the air, philosophical, religious,\r\npolitical, that were formative on young Jonathan when he was running around. \nJonathan Haidt  \nWell, you know, young Jonathan had a very standard upper middle class suburban American postwar childhood. Born in 1963. Raised in Scarsdale,\r\nNew York, a suburb north of the city. My father was an attorney, prototypical,\r\nquintessential Ashkenazi Jewish story. My grandparents all arrived from Europe in 1907, fleeing terrible conditions, dirt poor, worked in the garment industry, their children went to college, their children were successful. A very typical American Jewish story. And while my parents were raised in a world that had a little anti semitism, America has been fantastic for the Jews compared to anywhere else on the planet, by the time I came along, it was like nothing. It was gone in the 70s and 80s. It’s back now, but it was gone for a number of decades. While I wasn’t in any sense an intellectual as a child, I was very curious. I always love to take things apart. One of my favourite things...[Content truncated]",
