I’ve recently finished graduate school, found a job, and am getting ready to move from Wisconsin to California. As I’m still getting used to my new life in a new country, there is a presidential election going on back home. President Hassan Rouhani is seeking re-election for a second term, campaigning on a moderate platform against his conservative rival.\nJust like many recent immigrants, I’m still following the political developments of my home country very closely. This election is happening two years after the Iran-US nuclear deal, and a year after Donald Trump was elected president in the United States. I’m afraid that with the election of a hardliner in Iran, the two countries will head directly towards a war. I support Rouhani’s re-election, even though on most grounds he is ideologically as far from me as one could possibly imagine.\nAnd then I watch a music video released by the Rouhani campaign. (Rouhani Campaign Ad); (This video and the other eleven campaign videos discussed in this essay can also be found, in order, in the accompanying video slider, right or below.) Around three minutes long, the song title is Dobareh Iran (“Again, Iran”), Rouhani’s campaign slogan. The video starts with a simple montage of close-ups of Rouhani’s supporters, mostly isolated in a crowd using a shallow depth of field. People from different ethnicities, different ages, wearing different clothing. Mostly men, a few conservatively dressed women. The images are paced down to a slow-motion, slightly contrasting the more upbeat music and the faster editing pace. Every face is dead serious, deep into the eyes of every close-up you can see the deep concern. I see a reflection of myself in every single face. We are all thinking of the same thing, we understand each other, even though I am just looking at those faces behind the glass screen of a monitor thousands of miles away. I feel all of us are separate, but we are all one.\nThe music slowly rises. As Rouhani’s confident, smiling face appears on the screen, the singer sings “again, a smile.” The images cut from Rouhani’s smiling face to a close-up of the smiling face of a supporter. I also smile, instinctively, in response to them; I cannot control myself. The music rises more and...[Content truncated]",

            "content": {
                "content": "In 2010, researchers from Columbia and Harvard Universities examined whether brief postural adjustments – 'power poses' – could produce positive psychological, behavioural and hormonal outcomes. Their experiment revealed an emphatic 'yes' on all three questions, with the everyday implications clearly apparent. Stressful interpersonal contexts, such as job interviews, presentations and important meetings, could be helped through preparatory postural adjustment.\nAs the decade progressed, power posing became an idea whose time had come; , widespread organisational acceptance and a number of eye-catching interpretations by leading politicians. Despite this widening embrace, deeper academic questions emerged. Replication attempts did not reproduce the complete breadth of original results, and by 2016 power posing was firmly embroiled in the 'replication crisis' affecting social psychology.\nBut power posing would not go away. Larger quantitative examinations of its evidentiary credentials have suggested that significant benefits do remain… though with some caveats. With a recent systematic review and meta-analysis shedding further light on how postures can affect our emotions and behaviours, it is time to reflect on power posing's chequered first decade. Where it came from, where it now stands … and where to next?\nOrigins\n-------\nWithin social psychology, research into embodiment and embodied cognition explores how our postures and bodily movements can influence our emotional states (Veenstra et al., 2017). Its lineage can be traced back to the ideomotor action ideas of 19th century philosopher and psychologist William James, who asserted that emotions arise from physiology, so that bodily expressions contributed to the consequent feeling of emotions (James, 1950). In more recent times, embodiment has provided a rich terrain for exploration. The manipulation of facial expressions, voice management, breathing and posture can induce diverse emotional feelings, including happiness, sadness, anger and fear (Laird & Lacasse, 2013).\nPhysical posture has provided a particularly insightful lens for examining feelings of power – and powerlessness – across both human and animal studies (Ellyson & Dovidio, 1985; Huang et al., 2011). And referencing the gamut of postural research literature, three researchers from Columbia and Harvard Universities – Dana Carney, Amy Cuddy and Andy Yap – put forward an elegantly simple question in the September 2010 issue of _Psychological Science_: Can posed displays cause a person to feel more powerful?\nPower posing is born\n--------------------\nThe researchers identified two distinct nonverbal dimensions universally associated with demonstration – and...[Content truncated]",

            "content": "In 2010, researchers from Columbia and Harvard Universities examined whether brief postural adjustments – 'power poses' – could produce positive psychological, behavioural and hormonal outcomes. Their experiment revealed an emphatic 'yes' on all three questions, with the everyday implications clearly apparent. Stressful interpersonal contexts, such as job interviews, presentations and important meetings, could be helped through preparatory postural adjustment.\nAs the decade progressed, power posing became an idea whose time had come; , widespread organisational acceptance and a number of eye-catching interpretations by leading politicians. Despite this widening embrace, deeper academic questions emerged. Replication attempts did not reproduce the complete breadth of original results, and by 2016 power posing was firmly embroiled in the 'replication crisis' affecting social psychology.\nBut power posing would not go away. Larger quantitative examinations of its evidentiary credentials have suggested that significant benefits do remain… though with some caveats. With a recent systematic review and meta-analysis shedding further light on how postures can affect our emotions and behaviours, it is time to reflect on power posing's chequered first decade. Where it came from, where it now stands … and where to next?\nOrigins\n-------\nWithin social psychology, research into embodiment and embodied cognition explores how our postures and bodily movements can influence our emotional states (Veenstra et al., 2017). Its lineage can be traced back to the ideomotor action ideas of 19th century philosopher and psychologist William James, who asserted that emotions arise from physiology, so that bodily expressions contributed to the consequent feeling of emotions (James, 1950). In more recent times, embodiment has provided a rich terrain for exploration. The manipulation of facial expressions, voice management, breathing and posture can induce diverse emotional feelings, including happiness, sadness, anger and fear (Laird & Lacasse, 2013).\nPhysical posture has provided a particularly insightful lens for examining feelings of power – and powerlessness – across both human and animal studies (Ellyson & Dovidio, 1985; Huang et al., 2011). And referencing the gamut of postural research literature, three researchers from Columbia and Harvard Universities – Dana Carney, Amy Cuddy and Andy Yap – put forward an elegantly simple question in the September 2010 issue of _Psychological Science_: Can posed displays cause a person to feel more powerful?\nPower posing is born\n--------------------\nThe researchers identified two distinct nonverbal dimensions universally associated with demonstration – and...[Content truncated]"

                    "description": "If the video was edited to focus solely on the moments when Kim Jong Un and Putin raised their glasses to toast, it could lead to the misrepresentation of the nature of their interaction. A lack of footage showing their expressions or behaviors immediately following the toast could create an illusion of camaraderie that might not exist in the actual event. The context of their strained diplomatic relationship suggests that such ceremonial gestures might not reflect genuine feelings of trust or friendship."

By not incorporating commentary or background information, the video could mislead viewers into interpreting the leaders' interactions as more friendly or cooperative than they genuinely are. This manipulation might stem from an effort to portray a stronger alliance through superficial gestures, ignoring deeper issues at play in their relationship."

                    "description": "Research suggests that body language can significantly affect perceptions of power and trust in social interactions. If the video displays the leaders in close proximity and engaged in toasting without showing body language indicative of skepticism or discomfort, this selective representation may skew viewer perception. For example, if they appeared rigid or avoided eye contact after raising their glasses, these subtle cues might be lost in a manipulated version of the video that highlights only the act of toasting itself."

If the video has been manipulated to present a more relaxed or congenial atmosphere than what was authentically present, viewers may interpret their relationship incorrectly. The potential for miscommunication and misinterpretation around their non-verbal cues—if they were edited to appear more engaging than they truly were—may lead to a perceived alliance that is largely superficial."
