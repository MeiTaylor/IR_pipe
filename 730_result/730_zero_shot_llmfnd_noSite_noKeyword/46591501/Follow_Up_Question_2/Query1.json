If the director is unknown, someone in a similar role, such as a producer and/or writer, can be credited. To clarify what role the person has in the production, their job title such as Director is put after their name in round brackets if the job title is known.\n**Who to Credit - Streaming Video from a Website**\nFor videos from websites such as YouTube or Vimeo, credit the person who posted the content. If a real name is provided, use that followed by the person's user name in square brackets. If the real name of the person who posted the content is not known, just use their user name without brackets.\nNote: It is not necessary to specify how you watched a film or video (e.g. motion picture, DVD, streaming online).\nIn the Body of a Paper\n----------------------\n**Books, Journals, Reports, Webpages, etc.:** When you refer to titles of a “stand-alone work,” as the APA calls them on their  such as books, journals, reports, and webpages, you should italicize them. Capitalize words as you would for an article title in a reference, e.g., In the book _Crying in H Mart: A memoir_, author Michelle Zauner (2021) describes her biracial origin and its impact on her identity.\n**Article or Chapter:** When you refer to the title of a part of a work, such as an article or a chapter, put quotation marks around the title and capitalize it as you would for a journal title in a reference, e.g., In the...[Content truncated]",

We were able to extract audio from a video and edit the two separately. Like VlogNow VN Video Editor, Filmora Video Editor & Maker lets you tap to indicate beats on the music timeline. The beat icons can guide you in your editing of your video so you’ll have smoother transitions. However, you can also let Filmora Video Editor & Maker automatically generate the beats, a function not available in VlogNow VN Video Editor.\n    \n\n            Of course, Filmora Video Editor & Maker has a full range of tools for adjusting exposure, shadows and colors and much more.\n    \n\n            We liked that Filmora Video Editor & Maker exports directly to Facebook, Instagram, Telegram, TikTok, YouTube and, of course, your smartphone’s gallery where you can share via any resident app.\n    \n\n            The free version of Filmora Video Editor & Maker generates watermarked videos. The Premium version is $10 per month (billed quarterly) or $50 per year (billed annually). In addition to removing the watermark, the Premium version includes 1GB of cloud storage.\n    \n\n            Filmora Video Editor & Maker doesn’t support Dropbox, Google Photos or other third-party cloud storage for import or export. Also, when we purchased our Premium monthly installation for testing, it took a little digging as the monthly payment option wasn’t obvious to us at first.\n    \n\n            Filmora Video Editor & Maker is a feature-rich program with the largest and most varied content libraries installed with the app. What’s more, we found we could do more — and have more fun — with our test videos in Filmora Video Editor & Maker than in any of the other apps we tested.\n    \n\n            Mobile video editing apps aren’t precise or full-featured when compared to desktop computer apps. But they are quick and easy...[Content truncated]",

I’ve recently finished graduate school, found a job, and am getting ready to move from Wisconsin to California. As I’m still getting used to my new life in a new country, there is a presidential election going on back home. President Hassan Rouhani is seeking re-election for a second term, campaigning on a moderate platform against his conservative rival.\nJust like many recent immigrants, I’m still following the political developments of my home country very closely. This election is happening two years after the Iran-US nuclear deal, and a year after Donald Trump was elected president in the United States. I’m afraid that with the election of a hardliner in Iran, the two countries will head directly towards a war. I support Rouhani’s re-election, even though on most grounds he is ideologically as far from me as one could possibly imagine.\nAnd then I watch a music video released by the Rouhani campaign. (Rouhani Campaign Ad); (This video and the other eleven campaign videos discussed in this essay can also be found, in order, in the accompanying video slider, right or below.) Around three minutes long, the song title is Dobareh Iran (“Again, Iran”), Rouhani’s campaign slogan. The video starts with a simple montage of close-ups of Rouhani’s supporters, mostly isolated in a crowd using a shallow depth of field. People from different ethnicities, different ages, wearing different clothing. Mostly men, a few conservatively dressed women. The images are paced down to a slow-motion, slightly contrasting the more upbeat music and the faster editing pace. Every face is dead serious, deep into the eyes of every close-up you can see the deep concern. I see a reflection of myself in every single face. We are all thinking of the same thing, we understand each other, even though I am just looking at those faces behind the glass screen of a monitor thousands of miles away. I feel all of us are separate, but we are all one.\nThe music slowly rises. As Rouhani’s confident, smiling face appears on the screen, the singer sings “again, a smile.” The images cut from Rouhani’s smiling face to a close-up of the smiling face of a supporter. I also smile, instinctively, in response to them; I cannot control myself. The music rises more and...[Content truncated]",
