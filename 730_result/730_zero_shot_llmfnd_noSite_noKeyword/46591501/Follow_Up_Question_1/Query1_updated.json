The promotion of his younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, and the development of her public profile have raised speculation that she could be in line to be the successor. In recent years, she has joined her brother at summits with U.S. President Donald J. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, visited South Korea for the Olympics, and issued statements in her name as Pyongyang escalated tensions with Seoul in June 2020. Other close relatives who could also be involved in a power transition are Kim Sol-song, an older half sister, or Kim\u2019s older brother, Kim Jong-chul. Some family members, however, have fallen out of favor, including Kim\u2019s uncle Jang, who was married to Kim Kyong-hui, the daughter of Kim Il-sung. Kim Jong-nam, Kim\u2019s half brother, was assassinated in February 2017 in Malaysia in an attack suspected to have been carried out by North Korea.\nChief policymaking comes from the WPK\u2019s Central Committee and three subordinate institutions: the Political Bureau, or Politburo; the Control Commission; and the Executive Policy Bureau, which also controls surveillance and appoints top personnel across the party, cabinet, and military. The Central Committee\u2019s Organization Guidance Department (OGD) and Propaganda and Agitation Department are among the most influential party agencies. The Central Committee is made up of around twenty departments, ranging from the sciences to agriculture, that link to civilian state and military bodies. The governmental departments submit policy ideas to the respective entities of the party\u2019s Central Committee, who then deliberate, tweak, and approve initiatives. The party exercises policy control through this process. Decisions on matters such as North Korea\u2019s summits with South Korea and the United States have likely followed consultation between Kim and close aides, all of whom hold high positions within the party.\nMore on:\n\nNorth Korea\n\n\nPolitics and Government\n\n\nAuthoritarianism\n\n\nKim Jong-un\n\nThe party, first founded in the late 1940s, initially had strong ties to the Soviet and Chinese ruling Communist Parties, but as Kim Il-sung consolidated his position in the aftermath of the Korean War (1950\u20131953), the juche state philosophy came to dominate North Korean politics. Juche, translated as self-reliance, emphasizes independence and sovereignty as principles to guide the nation\u2019s politics, economy, and defenses. In North Korea, the military, the internal security apparatus, and the cabinet all play a supporting role to enact the party\u2019s vision, says Ken Gause, an expert on North Korean leadership at the Virginia-based research organization CNA, adding that \u201cthe military and the party are fused very closely.\u201d\nAnother ideological tenet,\u00a0...[Content truncated]",

How does individual performance compare with the wisdom of the crowds, and how do these performances compare to the leading model\u2019s performance? Does access to the model\u2019s predictions and certainty levels help or hinder participants\u2019 discernment? And, what explains variation in human and ma-chine performance; specifically, what is the role of video-level characteristics, can emotional priming influence participants\u2019 performance at detecting deepfakes, and does specialized processing of faces play a role in human and machine deepfake detection? Crowdsourcing and averaging individuals\u2019 responses are promising and practical solutions for handling the scale of mis-information that would be otherwise overwhelming for an individual expert. Recent empirical research finds that averaged responses of ordinary people are on-par with third-party fact checkers for both factual claims in articles 47 and overall accuracy of content from URL domain names 48 , 49 . In order to comprehensively compare humans to the leading AI model and evalu-ate collective intelligence against its artificial counterpart, we need to conduct two comparisons: How often do individuals outperform the model and how often does the the crowd wisdom outperform the model\u2019s prediction? While a machine will consistently predict the same result for the same input, human judgment depends on a range of factors including emotion. Recent research in social psychology suggests that negative emotions can reduce gullibility 50 , 51 ,which could perhaps improve individual\u2019s discernment of videos. In particular, anger has been shown to reduce depth of thought by promoting reliance on stereotypes and previously held beliefs 52 . Moreover, priming people with emotion has been demonstrated to both increase and decrease people\u2019s gullibility depending on the category of emotion 53 and hinder people\u2019s ability to discern real from fake news 54 . The role of emotion in deepfake detection is of practical concern because people share misinformation, especially political misinformation, because of its novelty and emotional content 55 . While a detailed examination of emotions as potential mechanisms to explain deepfake detection performance is outside the scope of this paper, we have included a pre-registered randomized experiment to evaluate whether experimentally elicited anger impairs participants\u2019 performance in detecting deepfakes. Based on research demonstrating human\u2019s expert visual processing of faces, we may expect humans to perform quite well at identifying the synthetic face manipulations in deepfake videos. Research in visual neuroscience and perceptual psychology has shown that the human visual system is equipped with mechanisms dedicated for face perception 56 . For example, there is a region of the brain specialized for processing faces 57 . Human infants show sensitivity to faces even...[Content truncated]",

Are humans or the leading machine learning model more capable of detecting algorithmic visual manipulations of videos? How should content moderation systems be designed to detect and flag video-based misinformation? We present data showing that ordinary humans perform in the range of the leading machine learning model on a large set of minimal context videos. While we find that a system integrating human and model predictions is more accurate than either humans or the model alone, we show inaccurate model predictions often lead humans to incorrectly update their responses. Finally, we demonstrate that specialized face processing and the ability to consider context may specially equip humans for deepfake detection.\nAbstract\n--------\nThe recent emergence of machine-manipulated media raises an important societal question: How can we know whether a video that we watch is real or fake? In two online studies with 15,016 participants, we present authentic videos and deepfakes and ask participants to identify which is which. We compare the performance of ordinary human observers with the leading computer vision deepfake detection model and find them similarly accurate, while making different kinds of mistakes. Together, participants with access to the model\u2019s prediction are more accurate than either alone, but inaccurate model predictions often decrease participants\u2019 accuracy. To probe the relative strengths and weaknesses of humans and machines as detectors of deepfakes, we examine human and machine performance across video-level features,...[Content truncated]",

In 2018, Kim Jong Un engaged in new diplomatic efforts with South Korea, the US, China, Russia, and others. Between March and May 2018, Kim Jong Un, who had not met any world leaders since he came to power in December 2011, met twice with Chinese President Xi Jinping, twice with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, and once with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.\nOn human rights, the international community has continued to press the North Korean government to expand its engagement with United Nations human rights mechanisms, including action on the findings of the UN Commission of Inquiry (COI) report on human rights in North Korea that found the government committed crimes against humanity including extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape and other forms of sexual violence, and forced abortion.\nOn December 11, 2017, for the fourth consecutive year, the UN Security Council put North Korea\u2019s egregious human rights violations  as a threat to international peace and security.

Numerous North Korea observers expected the regime to fail with the accession of the 27-year-old Kim Jong Un. Such expectations were reasonable since very few non-monarchical regimes have pulled off consecutive hereditary successions. Kim Jong Un has therefore defied expectations by not just surviving, but consolidating power.\nSo how did the North Korean regime pull off its second leader succession? Fortunately, events preceding Kim\u2019s succession in 2011 provide useful insights about future potential succession issues in North Korea, and elite politics in North Korea more generally. To understand how Kim Jong Il enabled his son\u2019s succession and consolidation, we therefore need to study how he manipulated intra-elite power relations within the regime.\nThe authors address this topic by analyzing how Kim Jong Il manipulated elites through invitations to public leadership events. Kim Jong Il significantly increased the prominence of civilians within the regime through these events. This facilitated Kim Jong Un\u2019s succession by enabling him to implement his preferred policies and preventing the military acting as a veto-player who could act against his wishes or even turn the young leader into their puppet. The final section examines the implications of the paper's findings for contemporary North Korean leadership politics.\n.\n* * *\nThe Understanding North Korea roundtable series is a joint program of the National Committee on North Korea and the Wilson Center\u2019s Hyundai Motor - Korean Foundation Center for Korean History and Public Policy.
