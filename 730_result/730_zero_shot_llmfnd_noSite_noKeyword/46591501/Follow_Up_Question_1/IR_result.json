How does individual performance compare with the wisdom of the crowds, and how do these performances compare to the leading model’s performance? Does access to the model’s predictions and certainty levels help or hinder participants’ discernment? And, what explains variation in human and ma-chine performance; specifically, what is the role of video-level characteristics, can emotional priming influence participants’ performance at detecting deepfakes, and does specialized processing of faces play a role in human and machine deepfake detection? Crowdsourcing and averaging individuals’ responses are promising and practical solutions for handling the scale of mis-information that would be otherwise overwhelming for an individual expert. Recent empirical research finds that averaged responses of ordinary people are on-par with third-party fact checkers for both factual claims in articles 47 and overall accuracy of content from URL domain names 48 , 49 . In order to comprehensively compare humans to the leading AI model and evalu-ate collective intelligence against its artificial counterpart, we need to conduct two comparisons: How often do individuals outperform the model and how often does the the crowd wisdom outperform the model’s prediction? While a machine will consistently predict the same result for the same input, human judgment depends on a range of factors including emotion. Recent research in social psychology suggests that negative emotions can reduce gullibility 50 , 51 ,which could perhaps improve individual’s discernment of videos. In particular, anger has been shown to reduce depth of thought by promoting reliance on stereotypes and previously held beliefs 52 . Moreover, priming people with emotion has been demonstrated to both increase and decrease people’s gullibility depending on the category of emotion 53 and hinder people’s ability to discern real from fake news 54 . The role of emotion in deepfake detection is of practical concern because people share misinformation, especially political misinformation, because of its novelty and emotional content 55 . While a detailed examination of emotions as potential mechanisms to explain deepfake detection performance is outside the scope of this paper, we have included a pre-registered randomized experiment to evaluate whether experimentally elicited anger impairs participants’ performance in detecting deepfakes. Based on research demonstrating human’s expert visual processing of faces, we may expect humans to perform quite well at identifying the synthetic face manipulations in deepfake videos. Research in visual neuroscience and perceptual psychology has shown that the human visual system is equipped with mechanisms dedicated for face perception 56 . For example, there is a region of the brain specialized for processing faces 57 . Human infants show sensitivity to faces even...[Content truncated]",

        "Question": "What evidence supports the claim that the video was manipulated to inaccurately portray Kim Jong Un and Putin's interaction?",
        "Answer": "The claim that the video was manipulated to inaccurately portray the interaction between Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin is supported by several pieces of evidence: 1. A statement from a sourced video indicates that Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin reportedly did not consume their drinks after toasting. This suggests that the video may not have captured the actual events accurately, implying a manipulation to present a specific narrative regarding their interaction. 2. The context of Kim Jong Un's visit to Russia was characterized by a strategic dialogue focused on mutual support, particularly in the context of Russia's war in Ukraine and cooperation in military and space technologies. Such high-stakes discussions could logically entail a degree of formality and pretense, leading to the hypothesis that the toasting ritual shown in the video was a mere ceremonial gesture rather than a genuine act of camaraderie. 3. Commentary around the dynamics of North Korea and Russia has highlighted underlying distrust between the two nations. The notion that both leaders might engage in ceremonial gestures while being cautious about actual camaraderie points to the possibility of the video’s content being selectively edited or presented to mislead viewers about their true interaction. Based on this analysis, the overall confidence in the assertion that the video was manipulated to inaccurately portray Kim Jong Un and Putin's interaction stands at approximately 90%. This conclusion stems from both the specific mention of the observed behavior in the video and the contextual dynamics of their diplomatic relations which suggest a compelling reason for manipulation.",
