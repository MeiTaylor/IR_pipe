The promotion of his younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, and the development of her public profile have raised speculation that she could be in line to be the successor. In recent years, she has joined her brother at summits with U.S. President Donald J. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, visited South Korea for the Olympics, and issued statements in her name as Pyongyang escalated tensions with Seoul in June 2020. Other close relatives who could also be involved in a power transition are Kim Sol-song, an older half sister, or Kim\u2019s older brother, Kim Jong-chul. Some family members, however, have fallen out of favor, including Kim\u2019s uncle Jang, who was married to Kim Kyong-hui, the daughter of Kim Il-sung. Kim Jong-nam, Kim\u2019s half brother, was assassinated in February 2017 in Malaysia in an attack suspected to have been carried out by North Korea.\nChief policymaking comes from the WPK\u2019s Central Committee and three subordinate institutions: the Political Bureau, or Politburo; the Control Commission; and the Executive Policy Bureau, which also controls surveillance and appoints top personnel across the party, cabinet, and military. The Central Committee\u2019s Organization Guidance Department (OGD) and Propaganda and Agitation Department are among the most influential party agencies. The Central Committee is made up of around twenty departments, ranging from the sciences to agriculture, that link to civilian state and military bodies. The governmental departments submit policy ideas to the respective entities of the party\u2019s Central Committee, who then deliberate, tweak, and approve initiatives. The party exercises policy control through this process. Decisions on matters such as North Korea\u2019s summits with South Korea and the United States have likely followed consultation between Kim and close aides, all of whom hold high positions within the party.\nMore on:\n\nNorth Korea\n\n\nPolitics and Government\n\n\nAuthoritarianism\n\n\nKim Jong-un\n\nThe party, first founded in the late 1940s, initially had strong ties to the Soviet and Chinese ruling Communist Parties, but as Kim Il-sung consolidated his position in the aftermath of the Korean War (1950\u20131953), the juche state philosophy came to dominate North Korean politics. Juche, translated as self-reliance, emphasizes independence and sovereignty as principles to guide the nation\u2019s politics, economy, and defenses. In North Korea, the military, the internal security apparatus, and the cabinet all play a supporting role to enact the party\u2019s vision, says Ken Gause, an expert on North Korean leadership at the Virginia-based research organization CNA, adding that \u201cthe military and the party are fused very closely.\u201d\nAnother ideological tenet,\u00a0...[Content truncated]",
