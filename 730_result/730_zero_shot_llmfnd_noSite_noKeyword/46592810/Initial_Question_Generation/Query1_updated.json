This claim is highly controversial; most scientists believe the virus spilled into human populations through natural zoonosis (transfer directly from an infected non-human animal), similar to the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV outbreaks, and consistent with other pandemics in human history.[1] Available evidence suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was originally harbored by bats, and spread to humans from infected wild animals, functioning as an intermediate host, at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019.[5][6] Several candidate animal species have been identified as potential intermediate hosts.[13] There is no evidence SARS-CoV-2 existed in any laboratory prior to the pandemic,[14][15][16] or that any suspicious biosecurity incidents happened in any laboratory.[17]\n\nMany scenarios proposed for a lab leak are characteristic of conspiracy theories.[18] Central to many is the misplaced suspicion about the proximity of the outbreak to a virology institute that studies coronaviruses, the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). Most large Chinese cities have laboratories that study coronaviruses,[14][need quotation to verify][19] and virus outbreaks typically begin in rural areas, but are first noticed in large cities.[20] If a coronavirus outbreak occurs in China, there is a high likelihood it will occur near a large city, and therefore near a laboratory studying coronaviruses.[20][21] The idea of a leak at the WIV also gained support due to secrecy during the Chinese government's response.[14][22] The lab leak theory and its weaponization by politicians have both leveraged and increased anti-Chinese racism.[23] Scientists from WIV had previously collected virus samples from bats in the wild, and allegations that they also performed undisclosed work on such viruses are central to some versions of the idea.[24] Some versions, particularly those alleging genome engineering, are based on misinformation or misrepresentations of scientific evidence.[25][26][27]\n\nThe idea that the virus was released...[Content truncated]",

When burned, all that oil and gas will release vast amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.  \nA new facility there aims to do the opposite. Rows of giant fans spread across a flat, arid field will pull carbon dioxide from the air and then pump it deep underground. When completed,  could capture 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, doing the air-scrubbing work of some 40 million trees.  \nCanadian firm  is designing and building this \"direct-air capture\" facility with , a joint venture between a subsidiary of . and the private equity firm . Carbon Engineering will devote much of 2021 to front-end engineering and design work in Texas, with construction slated to start the following year and operations by 2024, the partners say. The project is the biggest of its kind in the world and will likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars to develop.  \nCarbon Engineering is among a handful of companies with major direct-air capture developments underway this year.

He is the third child and second son of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and a younger brother of King Charles III. Andrew was born second in the line of succession to the British throne and is now eighth, and the first person in the line who is not a descendant of the reigning monarch.\nAndrew served in the Royal Navy as a helicopter pilot and instructor and as the captain of a warship. During the Falklands War, he flew on multiple missions including anti-surface warfare, casualty evacuation, and Exocet missile decoy. In 1986, he married Sarah Ferguson and was made Duke of York. They have two daughters: Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie. Their marriage, separation in 1992, and divorce in 1996 attracted extensive media coverage. As Duke of York, Andrew undertook official duties and engagements on behalf of his mother. He served as the UK's Special Representative for International Trade and Investment for 10 years until July 2011.\nIn 2014, Virginia Giuffre alleged that, as a 17-year-old, she was sex trafficked to Andrew by convicted sex offenders Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Andrew denied any wrongdoing. Following criticism for his association with Epstein and Maxwell, Andrew resigned from public roles in May 2020, and his honorary military affiliations and royal charitable patronages were removed by the Queen in January 2022. He was the defendant in a civil lawsuit over sexual assault filed by Giuffre in New York State. The lawsuit was settled out of court in February 2022; in the settlement, Andrew paid an undisclosed sum to Giuffre.\nEarly life\nGordonstoun school in Scotland\nPrince Andrew with his parents and brother Edward at the opening of the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Alberta\nAndrew was born in the Belgian Suite of Buckingham Palace on 19 February 1960 at 3:30 p.m., the third child and second son of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. He was baptised in the palace's Music Room on 8 April 1960.\nAndrew was the first child born to a reigning British monarch since Princess Beatrice in 1857.
