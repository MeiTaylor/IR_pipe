This is a very sad moment,” he told reporters in Lyon, France.\n    \n\nOne way in: Under the Israeli siege, the only corridor through which Palestinians or aid can pass in and out of Gaza is the Rafah Crossing that borders Egypt.\n    \n\n            Egypt on Thursday denied reports of the crossing being closed, saying it has however sustained damage due to repeated Israeli airstrikes on the Palestinian side of the border.\n    \n\n            CNN could not independently verify whether the crossing is open.\n    \n\n            Hamas on Friday told Palestinians living in Gaza not to leave their homes, according to a statement sent to media organizations.\n    \n\n            The armed group, which governs the territory, accused Israel of engaging in “psychological warfare” by sending messages that told Palestinian civilians and employees of international organizations to evacuate to the south.\n    \n\n        “The occupation is attempting to spread and circulate false propaganda through various means, aiming to create confusion among citizens and undermine the stability of our internal front,” the statement said, referring to Israel.\n    \n\n\n\n            Employees of “international institutions” remained at their posts and were not evacuating, the statement claimed. CNN has not independently verified the claim.\n    \n\n            Israel is maintaining its bombardment of Gaza in response to Hamas terror attacks that killed more than 1,300 people and has amassed more than 300,000 reservists along its southern border — but has not confirmed whether it is planning an intensified military operation.\n    \n\n            The Israeli military on Friday called on all civilians in Gaza City to evacuate “southwards.” The UN has said the order for 1.1 million people to leave northern Gaza was “impossible” without major humanitarian consequences.\n\n\n            The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) on Friday said it has relocated its central operations center and international staff in Gaza to the south of the besieged enclave.\n    \n\n            The silence on Lebanon’s border with Israel is deafening. After five days of near constant crossfire between fighters in Lebanon and Israeli forces, the guns seem to have largely gone quiet.\n    \n\n            This remains one of the most important, and dangerous, fault lines in this volatile region. Following the surprise Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, this frontier — largely calm since the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war — is even more charged with consequence.\n    \n\nAny conflict erupting here could pour fuel on the raging fire of the current Hamas-Israel war by drawing in the most powerful paramilitary group in the Middle East: Iran-backed Hezbollah...[Content truncated]",

This breach of that professionalism will be dealt with through disciplinary measures,” it said in a statement.\nAdd Al Jazeera to the list… The Supremacy around the media coverage of this isn't even subtle. pic.twitter.com/ZuZtJ70K69\n— T...[Content truncated]",

President Putin has also visited China in October 2023, reportedly to further strengthen Russian Chinese ties.]\nRussia has also sought to build its influence elsewhere in the world, particularly in Africa. Russia is the chief arms supplier to African nations, accounting for 40 percent of African imports of major weapons systems between 2018 and 2022.] Russian private military companies (PMCs) including the Wagner group are also known to be active in many African countries.] Indeed, the Wagner group is accused of significant human rights abuses in Mali and seeking to take advantage of instability in Niger following the recent coup in the country.] There have also been allegations that the Wagner group was directly or indirectly involved in the Niger coup itself, and protesters taking to the streets have been seen waving Russian flags.] The US is also reportedly worried about similar Russian PMC involvement in other countries in the Sahel region.]\nIn other significant recent international moves, in March 2023 Russia agreed a deal with neighbouring Belarus to station tactical nuclear weapons on its territory.] In addition, Russia has declared its noncompliance with the New START Treaty, designed to reduce the number of nuclear weapons held by the US and the Russian Federation, and indeed Russia has claimed that the treaty is now suspended.] The US has called these actions “irresponsible and unlawful”. On 26 October 2023, Russia announced that it had staged a wide-scale military exercise to rehearse its ability to deliver a “massive nuclear strike by strategic offensive forces in response to an enemy nuclear strike”.] It followed news earlier in October that Russia had reportedly successfully tested a nuclear-powered cruise missile.]\n### 1.3 China\nThe UK government has described China as an “epoch-defining and systemic challenge” to the UK.] Its approach towards China is based on several factors, including shared economic interests, security concerns and human rights considerations.\nIn recent decades, relations between the UK and China have encountered several challenges including geopolitical differences such as China’s use of force around Taiwan and its militarisation of disputed islands in the South China Sea.] There have also been tensions between the UK and China over the latter’s imposition of the national security law (NSL) in Hong Kong in June 2020 and in relation to human rights more broadly,] cybersecurity concerns including risks and potential threats posed by Chinese companies,] sanctions imposed on British parliamentarians by China, and allegations that China has been spying on UK interests.

During their meeting, Lavrov and Hussein discussed Iraq’s position on the Ukraine War and their mutual concern about the conflict’s secondary impacts, such as food insecurity and energy market instability. The remainder of Lavrov’s trip, which included meetings with Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, President Abdul Latif Rashid and Parliament Speaker Mohammed al-Halbussi, underscored the enduring strength of Russia-Iraq relations, and Iraq’s state INA news agency highlighted Russia as a “partner and friend.”\nDue to divided public opinion on Russia’s invasion and the conflict’s secondary economic impacts, Iraq has struck a cautious tone toward the Ukraine War. Russia’s primary objective in Iraq is to ensure that its extensive energy sector investments remain as immune as possible to Western sanctions. This objective has faced serious setbacks in recent months, as payment difficulties and commercial disruptions threaten Russia’s decade-long economic outreach to Iraqi Kurdistan.\nA Delicate Balancing Act\nSince Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Iraq has refrained from publicly condemning Russia’s aggression.

This Global Risk Analysis outlines a number of locations where new crises may emerge or where a particular situation may notably deteriorate within the next six months, causing a spike in humanitarian needs. \nThe risks included in this report were based on the identification of: \n• 'Emerging crises' (emerging risks) following new events or factors (triggers) that may emerge over the coming six months. Such triggers would point towards a hazard materialising, which would result in new or more severe humanitarian needs in a monitored context. \n• Potential 'rapid and marked deterioration' in an existing crisis \nthat, because of a combination of deteriorating trends and new events, may significantly deteriorate in the next six months, leading to worse humanitarian outcomes. We run a trend analysis to identify such risks. It should be noted that a humanitarian situation that deteriorates at the same pace is considered a trend and not a risk. This report does not include trends. \nACAPS closely monitors previously identified risks to see if they materialise. You can find the updates on the risks identified in the March 2023 ACAPS Global Risk Analysis at the end of this report .ACAPS has identified risks over the next...[Content truncated]",

The People’s Defense Forces formed new collaborations with ethnic armed factions that were already in direct conflict with the military.xviii Consequently, Myanmar entered into a full-scale civil war.\nThe root causes of the war, apart from the coup d’état that followed the violent crackdown, trace back to colonial period and postcolonial rule, when the country faced serious challenges in nation-building. Military rule took over the country within a decade after independence. Tensions rose between the various minorities and the majority Bama population for land, resources, religion, and other socioeconomic reasons.

The coverage highlighted the seriousness of the crisis and its implications for security in Europe and globally.xxii\nIt was not too long before bias in media narratives could be observed, with certain outlets emphasizing specific aspects of the conflict over others, primarily based on their country’s geopolitical interests. Western media outlets emphasized Russia’s aggression and violation of international law.
