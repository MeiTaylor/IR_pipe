After five days of near constant crossfire between fighters in Lebanon and Israeli forces, the guns seem to have largely gone quiet.\n    \n\n            This remains one of the most important, and dangerous, fault lines in this volatile region. Following the\u00a0surprise Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, this frontier \u2014 largely calm since the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war \u2014 is even more charged with consequence.\n    \n\nAny conflict erupting here could pour fuel on the raging fire of the current Hamas-Israel war by drawing in the most powerful paramilitary group in the Middle East: Iran-backed Hezbollah...[Content truncated]",

This Global Risk Analysis outlines a number of locations where new crises may emerge or where a particular situation may notably deteriorate within the next six months, causing a spike in humanitarian needs. \nThe risks included in this report were based on the identification of: \n\u2022 'Emerging crises' (emerging risks) following new events or factors (triggers) that may emerge over the coming six months. Such triggers would point towards a hazard materialising, which would result in new or more severe humanitarian needs in a monitored context. \n\u2022 Potential 'rapid and marked deterioration' in an existing crisis \nthat, because of a combination of deteriorating trends and new events, may significantly deteriorate in the next six months, leading to worse humanitarian outcomes. We run a trend analysis to identify such risks. It should be noted that a humanitarian situation that deteriorates at the same pace is considered a trend and not a risk. This report does not include trends. \nACAPS closely monitors previously identified risks to see if they materialise. You can find the updates on the risks identified in the March 2023 ACAPS Global Risk Analysis at the end of this report .ACAPS has identified risks over the next...[Content truncated]",

The People\u2019s Defense Forces formed new collaborations with ethnic armed factions that were already in direct conflict with the military.xviii Consequently, Myanmar entered into a full-scale civil war.\nThe root causes of the war, apart from the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat that followed the violent crackdown, trace back to colonial period and postcolonial rule, when the country faced serious challenges in nation-building. Military rule took over the country within a decade after independence. Tensions rose between the various minorities and the majority Bama population for land, resources, religion, and other socioeconomic reasons. There are more than 135 ethnic minorities in Myanmar, some of which are not even recognized officially by the Burmese government. Most of the major ethnic minorities have established their own jurisdictions and guerilla forces as their way of self-determination.xix\nThe death toll resulting from the ongoing civil war is difficult to verify, though figures as high as 38,000 are estimated to have been killed since February 2021, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project.xx Large-scale displacement of refugees into Thailand and other neighboring states continues. Severe human rights abuses \u2013 including extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, scorched earth, and indiscriminate attacks on civilian populations \u2013 are well documented in the case of the Myanmar civil war. In addition, the slow genocide continues against Rohingya minorities in northwestern Myanmar through severe restrictions of movement, economic activity, and access to aid.xxi\n**4\\. INTERNATIONAL RESPONSES TO THE CONFLICT IN UKRAINE**\nThe international responses to the conflict in Ukraine are manifested in a wide variety of domains, ranging from media to economic aid to political actions to military assistance. This is in addition to international humanitarian aid and responses from civil society organizations.\n**Media Coverage**\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 triggered a sudden surge in international media coverage on \u201cthe war in Europe.\u201d News outlets worldwide reported the invasion in real time, particularly on the wide-scale destruction and civilian casualties. The coverage highlighted the seriousness of the crisis and its implications for security in Europe and globally.xxii\nIt was not too long before bias in media narratives could be observed, with certain outlets emphasizing specific aspects of the conflict over others, primarily based on their country\u2019s geopolitical interests. Western media outlets emphasized Russia\u2019s aggression and violation of international law. They highlighted Ukraine\u2019s struggle for sovereignty and its freedom to choose the influence it preferred.xxiii\nOn the contrary, the...[Content truncated]",
