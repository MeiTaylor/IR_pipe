GENERAL OBSERVATIONS AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \nOn 3 March 2022 the Moscow Mechanism of the human dimension of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) was invoked by Ukraine supported by 45 participating States. Consequently, a Mission of three experts was appointed on 14 March 2022, which according to the rules of the Moscow Mechanism was to complete its work within three weeks and therefore delivered its report to Ukraine as the inviting state on 5 April 2022. The mandate was defined as to \n• Establish the facts and circumstances surrounding possible contraventions of OSCE commitments, and violations and abuses of international human rights law and international humanitarian law; \n• Establish the facts and circumstances of possible cases of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including due to deliberate and indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure; and to collect, consolidate, and analyze this information with a view to presenting it to relevant accountability mechanisms, as well as national, regional, or international courts or tribunals that have, or may in future have, jurisdiction. \nGiven the wide mandate, the Mission invited all potential sources to contribute evidence and did receive support from many sides, in particular from NGOs on the ground and from those with particular investigative capacities. Unfortunately, the Permanent Representation of the Russian Federation informed the Mission upon request that it considered the Moscow Mechanism largely outdated and redundant. The Permanent Representation also declined to nominate a liaison person but referred the Mission to the official statements and briefings of the Government of the Russian Federation, which made it impossible for the Mission to take account of the Russian position on all pertinent incidents, except based on official open sources and websites. A detailed assessment of most allegations of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) violations and the identification of war crimes concerning particular incidents has not been possible. Nevertheless, the mission found clear patterns of IHL violations by the Russian forces in their conduct of hostilities. If they had respected their IHL obligations in terms of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack and concerning specially protected objects such as hospitals, the number of civilians killed or injured would have remained much lower. Similarly, considerably fewer houses, hospitals, cultural properties, schools, multi-story residential buildings, water stations and electricity systems would have been damaged or destroyed. Furthermore, much of the conduct of Russian forces displayed in the parts of Ukraine it occupied before and after 24 February 2022, including through its proxies, the self...[Content truncated]",

But both in Ukraine and around the world, the war is also increasing vulnerability to climate change, proliferating long-term security risks, complicating efforts on decarbonization and hindering multilateral climate action. \n— Ukraine already faced challenges in mitigating and adapting to climate change. The invasion has made the country even more vulnerable, having damaged the environment, destroyed infrastructure and thrown large parts of the population into poverty and displacement. \n— The effects of the war are being felt far beyond Ukraine’s borders, particularly in terms of food and energy security. Russia’s on–off blockade of Ukraine’s food exports via the Black Sea and the impact of sanctions on Russia’s own food and fertilizer exports have led to unprecedented volatility in global food prices. That volatility has increased hunger and deprivation. \n— The war has also upended global energy politics. Energy independence, belatedly viewed as a precondition to political security, is now a renewed concern for policymakers. What this means for climate action is uncertain. In the short term, new carbon emissions risk being locked in, as worries over energy independence could encourage countries to delay or cancel action on reducing their carbon footprints. But Russia’s actions in fact provide a compelling argument for phasing down reliance on fossil fuels. \n— Ultimately, the war may prove a milestone in an emerging period of ‘deglobalization’ that could make collective action on global challenges, including climate change, more difficult. But much depends on actions taken now. Post-war, with international help, Ukraine can rebuild its damaged infrastructure and leap forward to a more resilient, cleaner and low-emission future. Meanwhile, it is more important than ever to promote the necessary multilateral cooperation that can help the world to avert dangerous climate change and adapt to its effects. 3 Chatham House \n# 01 Introduction The cascading impacts of war in Ukraine are affecting people not just in Ukraine but around the world. \nThe full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia may have begun on 24 February 2022, but it was preceded by the illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia in early 2014 and more than eight years of de facto occupation in...[Content truncated]",

Conflict escalates across Ukraine, and Russia indiscriminately \ntargets civilian infrastructure. Air strikes increase throughout the country. Biological \nand chemical agents cause significant casualties, while nuclear coercion escalates, with \nRussia moving its nuclear attack capacities closer to the Ukrainian borders or destabilising \nnuclear power plants. Ukraine’s economy contracts, exports decrease, and attacks on critical infrastructure drive inflation and limit the financial capacity for reconstruction. Living \nconditions deteriorate as the Government of Ukraine (GOU) struggles to meet the demand for \nessential services, relying more heavily on humanitarian organisations. Displacement within and from the country rises, aggravating regional disparities. Basic needs become harder to meet, psychological trauma increases, and access for humanitarian assistance becomes \nmore severely restricted. \n# Scenario 2: turbulent \nConflict intensifies locally, affecting new regions. Front lines shift, particularly in the east and south, while new areas in the north come under attack. The increased use of private military \ncompanies (PMCs) prolongs the pressure on Ukraine and ramps up uncertainty around war \ndevelopments. Air strikes continue to target military and civilian infrastructure, causing \ndamage and disruption. Attacks on Kyiv (including guerrilla-style operations) and sabotage \nand guerrilla-style attacks within Russia increase. The presence of PMCs leads to increased human rights abuses. Despite some degree of stability in the Ukrainian economy thanks to international assistance and the renewal of the Grain Deal, economic activities are severely hampered in conflict-affected areas. Displacement occurs, mostly for short distances within the country, and access to basic needs and services becomes more challenging. Humanitarian operations face significant constraints, with progressively limited access, increased security risks, and disrupted supply chains. \n# Scenario 3: protracted \nConflict in Ukraine remains at a similar level as in early 2023, with occasional localised \nescalations and minimal territorial gains by both sides. Aerial attacks continue to cause \ndamage, while front lines remain heavily shelled, impeding access to essential services. The Ukrainian economy struggles to recover, facing high inflation and limited opportunities for economic growth. Displacement protracts,...[Content truncated]",

With all candidates allowed to stand, the presidential election avoided some of the controversies of 2018. But despite Tshisekedi’s wide margin of victory, the polls were marked by chaos and reports of rigging. The political landscape remains deeply divided, and in the east, both Ituri and North Kivu provinces are rocked by instability. In the former, the Allied Democratic Forces continues its murderous campaign against civilians, attacking targets in Uganda, too, despite a Ugandan military campaign in Ituri since late 2021. In North Kivu, the 23 March Movement, widely seen as backed by Rwanda, continues to fight the Congolese army, which is backed by informal auxiliaries as well as allies from the Southern African Development Community. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have fled their homes as fighting spreads. Crisis Group aims to provide detailed recommendations on h"

Meanwhile, leaked UN report noted heavy Rwandan military presence in North Kivu (see Rwanda).\nNew govt took office after months of delay. National Assembly 11 June endorsed new 54-member strong govt under PM Suminwa, dominated by President Tshisekedi’s Union for Democracy and Social Progress and close associates. Sidelining or demoting of senior ruling-coalition figures and their parties – including National Assembly head Vital Kamerhe and FM Lutundula – incited discontent over perceived power grab by Tshisekedi. Meanwhile, church observation mission 17 June published final report on Dec 2023 general elections, criticising electoral commission’s handling of vote. \nDans cet épisode d’Afrique 360°, Enrica Picco et Rinaldo Depagne reçoivent Richard Moncrieff, directeur du projet des Grands Lacs, et Onesphore Sematumba, analyste pour la République Démocratique du Congo (RDC) et le Burundi à International Crisis Group, pour parler du conflit meurtrier à l’est de la  RDC et de ses conséquences humanitaires dévastatrices.\nThe gruelling war in Ukraine continues, with Russian forces creeping forward amid fierce fighting. To stop Russia’s immediate momentum and withstand its assault, Kyiv and its backers will need to move quickly to fix problems that have hindered the Ukrainian effort to date.\nIn this episode of The Horn, Alan Boswell talks with Crisis Group expert Richard Moncrieff about the attacks in Kinshasa last weekend and escalating violence in eastern Congo amid shifting regional alliances.\nThe eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has become a battleground for several regional armies and numerous rebel bands. Crisis Group expert Onesphore Sematumba explains the ins and outs of the deadly conflict in this interview.  \nThis week on Hold Your Fire!, Richard is joined by Richard Moncrieff, Crisis Group’s Great Lakes director, to discuss M23 rebels’ advances in eastern DR Congo, Rwanda’s involvement and whether diplomacy and a southern African force can curb violence. \nHaving won a second term in December’s divisive, chaotic polls, Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi faces the tasks of reuniting the country and addressing raging violence in the east.

This outbreak was classified as SARS-CoV2 and is the cause of the COVID-19 disease. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declares it a Pandemic and today it is considered the greatest challenge in global health that humanity has faced since World War II and it is estimated that between 40 and 60% of the population worldwide will catch the virus. This has caused enormous challenges in countries around the world in social, economic, environmental and obviously health issues. These challenges are mainly due to the effects of the established quarantines in almost all capitals and major cities around the world, from Asia, Europe to America. However, these lockdown which began worldwide from January 23, have had a significant impact on the environment and on the air quality of cities as recently reported by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and ESA (European Space Agency), with reductions according to them of up to 30% in some of the epicenters such as the case of Wuhan. Knowing that air pollution causes approximately 29% of lung cancer deaths, 43% of COPD deaths, and 25% of ischemic heart disease deaths,...[Content truncated]",
