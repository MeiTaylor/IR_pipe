But both in Ukraine and around the world, the war is also increasing vulnerability to climate change, proliferating long-term security risks, complicating efforts on decarbonization and hindering multilateral climate action. \n— Ukraine already faced challenges in mitigating and adapting to climate change. The invasion has made the country even more vulnerable, having damaged the environment, destroyed infrastructure and thrown large parts of the population into poverty and displacement. \n— The effects of the war are being felt far beyond Ukraine’s borders, particularly in terms of food and energy security. Russia’s on–off blockade of Ukraine’s food exports via the Black Sea and the impact of sanctions on Russia’s own food and fertilizer exports have led to unprecedented volatility in global food prices. That volatility has increased hunger and deprivation. \n— The war has also upended global energy politics. Energy independence, belatedly viewed as a precondition to political security, is now a renewed concern for policymakers. What this means for climate action is uncertain. In the short term, new carbon emissions risk being locked in, as worries over energy independence could encourage countries to delay or cancel action on reducing their carbon footprints. But Russia’s actions in fact provide a compelling argument for phasing down reliance on fossil fuels. \n— Ultimately, the war may prove a milestone in an emerging period of ‘deglobalization’ that could make collective action on global challenges, including climate change, more difficult. But much depends on actions taken now. Post-war, with international help, Ukraine can rebuild its damaged infrastructure and leap forward to a more resilient, cleaner and low-emission future. Meanwhile, it is more important than ever to promote the necessary multilateral cooperation that can help the world to avert dangerous climate change and adapt to its effects. 3 Chatham House \n# 01 Introduction The cascading impacts of war in Ukraine are affecting people not just in Ukraine but around the world. \nThe full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia may have begun on 24 February 2022, but it was preceded by the illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia in early 2014 and more than eight years of de facto occupation in...[Content truncated]",

This is followed by an assessment of what threat this poses in the broader strategic context of the war and after it will be over. The analysis brings forward two key points. First, groups like these are a product and exponent of political warfare by state actors, featuring as tools for covert action. Second, by incorporating such militias into the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the Ukrainian government makes their radical attitudes diminish. Nationalism, even in the extreme spectrum of political ideology, could be a product of the war. Meeting the criteria for integration into the European Union is an important factor stimulating rule-based order and deradicalization processes.

But both in Ukraine and around the world, the war is also increasing vulnerability to climate change, proliferating long-term security risks, complicating efforts on decarbonization and hindering multilateral climate action. \n— Ukraine already faced challenges in mitigating and adapting to climate change. The invasion has made the country even more vulnerable, having damaged the environment, destroyed infrastructure and thrown large parts of the population into poverty and displacement. \n— The effects of the war are being felt far beyond Ukraine’s borders, particularly in terms of food and energy security. Russia’s on–off blockade of Ukraine’s food exports via the Black Sea and the impact of sanctions on Russia’s own food and fertilizer exports have led to unprecedented volatility in global food prices. That volatility has increased hunger and deprivation. \n— The war has also upended global energy politics. Energy independence, belatedly viewed as a precondition to political security, is now a renewed concern for policymakers. What this means for climate action is uncertain. In the short term, new carbon emissions risk being locked in, as worries over energy independence could encourage countries to delay or cancel action on reducing their carbon footprints. But Russia’s actions in fact provide a compelling argument for phasing down reliance on fossil fuels. \n— Ultimately, the war may prove a milestone in an emerging period of ‘deglobalization’ that could make collective action on global challenges, including climate change, more difficult. But much depends on actions taken now. Post-war, with international help, Ukraine can rebuild its damaged infrastructure and leap forward to a more resilient, cleaner and low-emission future. Meanwhile, it is more important than ever to promote the necessary multilateral cooperation that can help the world to avert dangerous climate change and adapt to its effects. 3 Chatham House \n# 01 Introduction The cascading impacts of war in Ukraine are affecting people not just in Ukraine but around the world. \nThe full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia may have begun on 24 February 2022, but it was preceded by the illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia in early 2014 and more than eight years of de facto occupation in...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What evidence exists to support ongoing hardships in Kyiv that contradict the beach party's portrayal?",
        "Answer": "There is substantial evidence supporting the ongoing hardships in Kyiv that contradict the portrayal of leisurely beach parties and normalcy seen in the viral video. Here are several points highlighting these contradictions:\n\n1. **Intensifying Military Conflict**: Recent reports indicate that the situation in various frontline cities, such as Bakhmut, is deteriorating. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that Russian forces have intensified their efforts to capture Bakhmut, leading to significant civilian distress and military confrontations. The ongoing violence contradicts the carefree atmosphere depicted in the beach party video.\n\n2. **Humanitarian Crises and Living Conditions**: A report outlines that living conditions in Ukraine are becoming increasingly strained due to the continuing conflict. As air strikes target military and civilian infrastructure, people in affected areas face severe challenges in meeting basic needs. Access to essential services is deteriorating, and humanitarian assistance is becoming more restricted, which undermines the image of a society enjoying beach parties whilst war rages on.\n\n3. **Economic Impact and Displacement**: The war has had dire economic consequences for Ukraine, leading to a contraction of the economy, rising inflation, and increased displacement within the country. Many citizens are struggling to cope due to destroyed infrastructure and ongoing military pressure, creating an environment where leisure activities like beach parties may not reflect the broader societal reality.\n\n4. **Broader Global and Local Impacts**: The war's consequences extend beyond immediate military conflicts, affecting food and energy security and exacerbating poverty among the population. The blockade of Ukrainian food exports has resulted in global food price volatility, leading to increased hunger and hardship in Ukraine, contrasting sharply with the carefree leisure depicted in the viral beach party video.\n\nIn conclusion, while the beach party video presents a snapshot of leisure in Kyiv, the evidence clearly demonstrates that ongoing hardships due to war complicate this portrayal. The current reality in Ukraine is marked by military conflict, economic distress, and humanitarian crises, making the video an oversimplified representation of life amid war.",
