After five days of near constant crossfire between fighters in Lebanon and Israeli forces, the guns seem to have largely gone quiet.\n    \n\n            This remains one of the most important, and dangerous, fault lines in this volatile region. Following the\u00a0surprise Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, this frontier \u2014 largely calm since the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war \u2014 is even more charged with consequence.\n    \n\nAny conflict erupting here could pour fuel on the raging fire of the current Hamas-Israel war by drawing in the most powerful paramilitary group in the Middle East: Iran-backed Hezbollah...[Content truncated]",

Prigozhin on Friday accused Russia\u2019s military of attacking a Wagner camp and killing a \u201chuge amount\u201d of his men. He vowed to retaliate with force, insinuating that his forces would \u201cdestroy\u201d any resistance, including roadblocks and aircraft.\n    \n\n            Prigozhin later rowed back on his threat, saying his criticism of the Russian military leadership was a \u201cmarch of justice\u201d and not a coup \u2013 but by that point he appears to have already crossed a line with the Kremlin.\n    \n\n            Late on Friday, Prigozhin said his fighters had entered Russia\u2019s Rostov region.\n    \n\nWhat Russia\u2019s saying. Russia\u2019s defense ministry has denied attacking Wagner troops, calling the claim \u201cinformational propaganda.\u201d And the FSB also opened a criminal case against Prigozhin for his threats, accusing him of calling for \u201can armed rebellion.\u201d\n    \n\n            Russian President Vladimir Putin is aware of the situation, according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.\n    \n\n            Russian officials meanwhile appeared to take no chances with security measures stepping up in Moscow, according to Russian state media TASS.
