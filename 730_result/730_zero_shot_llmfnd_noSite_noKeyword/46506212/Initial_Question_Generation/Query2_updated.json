Comparably, that figure was only 9 percent a month into the war and 7 percent in May 2022.\nIt has also become a Republican talking point both for 2024 hopefuls and congressional lawmakers  to pass the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) if it includes more money for Ukraine.\n> Beach club in Kyiv during the war.         \n> \n> \nThough the TikTok clip does not offer dire images of destruction that many imagine war to look like, reports from as early as last summer document Ukrainians returning...[Content truncated]",

However, other users on Twitter soon weighed in that the video was actually filmed at the Strandbad Pl\u00f6tzensee, a lake in the city of Berlin, Germany!\nAnother video also circulated showing a party-like gathering at the Ibiza Beach Club in Odesa. It does resemble the images and videos on the club's official website, and it is\u2014or at least was\u2014a very popular hotspot, yet, it remains unclear when the video may have actually been filmed. The club's Facebook page hasn't been updated since 2018 and no videos have been posted to its YouTube page since July of 2021\u2014more than six months before Russia launched its unprovoked invasion.\nIt would appear that the Ibiza Beach Club in Odesa may still be closed.\nHowever, there is a grain of truth to the story. As Reuters reported on Saturday, several beaches in the city have been officially opened for swimming, but bathing in the sea is banned during air raid alerts. It is also important to note the city has been repeatedly attacked with missiles and drones, while the waters have been littered with hundreds of sea mines. In other words, people may be swimming in Ukraine, but it is hardly the party atmosphere some on social media have suggested.\n\"This is a classic piece of disinformation. There are a few interesting things about this. First, this is what I always think of as a 'cheap fake' instead of a 'DeepFake,'\" said Dr. Cliff Lampe, professor of information and associate dean for academic affairs in the School of Information at the University of Michigan.\n\"The only thing they did was to add a tag to an already existing video,\" explained Lampe. \"No AI needed, just the simplest of video techniques. We've seen this several times, and these cheap fakes are very prevalent as a type of disinformation.\"\nLampe added that whoever first posted the video was also clever in that it uses attractive people to immediately grab attention, but then also layers on sexual moral judgment onto anti-Biden or anti-war intents.\n\"Disinformation needs to gather attention, which this effectively did, and it is more effective when it hits on multiple levels of outrage,\" said Lampe. \"I wouldn't say this changed any minds.

There isn't much left of the building that previously housed apartments and the bar, which had been turned into a bomb shelter. It took a direct hit in the early days of the war, killing and wounding those inside.\nGrim irony for a bar named after the legendary war author Earnest Hemingway.\nUndeterred, the people behind the bar reopened it just a few blocks away as soon as they could.\n\"I had mixed feelings,\" owner Konstantin Kuts told CBS News. \"Because I lost my business, but I did not lose my life.

Like the vast majority of Maersk staffers, he had no idea when he might return to work.

Under a highway overpass, across some trash-strewn railroad tracks, and through a concrete gate stands the four-story headquarters of Linkos Group, a small, family-run Ukrainian software business.\nUp three flights of stairs in that building is a server room, where a rack of \u00adpizza-box-sized computers is connected by a tangle of wires and marked with handwritten, numbered labels.

The conflict has also seen Ukraine become a  for Russian cyberwar tactics. In 2015 and 2016, while the Kremlin-linked hackers known as  were busy breaking into the US Democratic National Committee\u2019s servers, another group of agents known as  was hacking into dozens of Ukrainian governmental organizations and companies. They penetrated the networks of victims ranging from media outlets to railway firms, detonating logic bombs that destroyed terabytes of data. The attacks followed a sadistic seasonal cadence. In the winters of both years, the saboteurs capped off their destructive sprees by causing widespread power outages\u2014the first confirmed blackouts induced by hackers.\nBut those attacks still weren\u2019t Sandworm\u2019s grand finale.

These are, first and\u00a0foremost, the\u00a0consequences of\u00a0our\nown mistakes made at\u00a0different periods of\u00a0time. But these are also the\u00a0result\nof\u00a0deliberate efforts by\u00a0those forces that have always sought to\u00a0undermine our\nunity. The\u00a0formula they apply has been known from time immemorial\u00a0\u2013 divide and\u00a0rule. There is nothing new here. Hence the\u00a0attempts to\u00a0play on\u00a0the\u00a0\u201dnational question\u201c and\u00a0sow discord among people, the\u00a0overarching\ngoal being to\u00a0divide and\u00a0then to\u00a0pit the\u00a0parts of\u00a0a\u00a0single people against one\nanother.\nTo\u00a0have a\u00a0better understanding of\u00a0the\u00a0present and\u00a0look into the\u00a0future, we\nneed to\u00a0turn to\u00a0history. Certainly, it is impossible to\u00a0cover in\u00a0this article\nall the\u00a0developments that have taken place over more than a\u00a0thousand years. But\nI\u00a0will focus on\u00a0the\u00a0key, pivotal moments that are important for\u00a0us to\u00a0remember,\nboth in\u00a0Russia and\u00a0Ukraine.\nRussians, Ukrainians, and\u00a0Belarusians are all descendants of\u00a0Ancient Rus,\nwhich was the\u00a0largest state in\u00a0Europe. Slavic and\u00a0other tribes across the\u00a0vast\nterritory\u00a0\u2013 from Ladoga, Novgorod, and\u00a0Pskov to\u00a0Kiev and\u00a0Chernigov\u00a0\u2013\nwere bound together by\u00a0one language (which we now refer to\u00a0as\u00a0Old Russian),\neconomic ties, the\u00a0rule of\u00a0the\u00a0princes of\u00a0the\u00a0Rurik dynasty, and\u00a0\u2013 after\nthe\u00a0baptism of\u00a0Rus\u00a0\u2013 the\u00a0Orthodox faith. The\u00a0spiritual choice made by\u00a0St.\nVladimir, who was both Prince of\u00a0Novgorod and\u00a0Grand Prince of\u00a0Kiev, still\nlargely determines our affinity today. \nThe\u00a0throne of\u00a0Kiev held a\u00a0dominant position in\u00a0Ancient Rus. This had been\nthe\u00a0custom since the\u00a0late 9th century. The\u00a0Tale of\u00a0Bygone Years captured for\u00a0posterity the\u00a0words of\u00a0Oleg the\u00a0Prophet about Kiev, \u201dLet it...[Content truncated]",

Most of these images date from before the war, however, and some of the establishments where they were filmed have been closed since the conflict began in February 2022.        \nIssued on: 12/05/2023 - 14:09\nIf you only have a minute Several posts, including one with a video viewed more than 8 million times, claim to show current scenes of the nightlife in Kyiv, apparently showing that the population of Ukraine is using donations from the West to throw these parties despite the war. The footage in the video, however, comes from scenes filmed in 2021, or in establishments that have been closed since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. Nightlife has indeed resumed in Kyiv over the past few months after the curfew in the city was extended to midnight in March. However, the venues shown in these videos say they have not received any donations, instead organising parties to donate their profits to the Ukrainian army.\u00a0The fact-check, in detail\"Meanwhile in Kyiv nightclubs \u2026 Please donate more money!\" says the Twitter account @RadioGenova, which often shares pro-Russian disinformation, above a video compilation showing Ukrainians partying in nightclubs.\"So...[Content truncated]",
