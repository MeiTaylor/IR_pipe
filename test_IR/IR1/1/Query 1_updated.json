This was the most awesome sight I've experienced so far in Florida! We saw over 50 black tip sharks in the shallow water all at the same time just feet from where we were standing. . The sharks were chasing small bait fish to feed. There were people in the water and even though the sharks would get close out of curiosity, they never bothered anyone (that's not in their nature). . Sharks are amazing animals that need protection because their lives are very important to the ecosystem and the Earth. . They provide balance to the ocean ecosystems. Without them, the oceans would become unhealthy which is not only harmful to the life within it, but it's also harmful to humans. The ocean provides the Earth with over 50% of the oxygen we need to survive. If the ocean becomes unhealthy, the oxygen will eventually be depleted and humanity will cease to exist. . WE NEED SHARKS. .

Long-time readers of TetZoo \u2013 those who remember or read things from versions 2 (the ScienceBlogs years) and 3 (the SciAm years) \u2013 may remember the several articles there devoted to Cadborosaurus, the supposed sea monster of the British Columbian coast. Partly because those articles have been corrupted or paywalled by their hosters, I figured it\u2019s time to republish the better part of my Cadborosaurus thoughts here at tetzoo.com. Plus I\u2019ve just produced some quantity of text on the subject for one my TetZoocryptomegathreads at Twitter. Ok\u2026 Cadborosaurus: the background. European colonists of coastal British Columbia, Canada and Washington, USA claimed \u2013 from the 1880s onwards* \u2013 to witness a large sea monster in the region\u2019s coastal waters. Sometimes said to have a head shaped like that of a camel or horse, sometimes said to be hump-backed or serpentine, and sometimes said to be furry or hairy, or scaly, or wrinkled, it became associated in particular with British Columbia\u2019s Cadboro Bay. In 1933, editor and journalist Archie H. Wills at the Victoria Daily Times adopted the name Cadborosaurus for this mystery sea creature, a moniker first suggested in a letter written to the Victoria Daily Times by I. Vacedun in 1933. * A possible 1791 account was also accepted by some researchers (LeBlond 2001).
