        "Question": "Is there verifiable documentation or eyewitness testimony corroborating the presence of a shark on the flooded highway during Hurricane Ian in Florida?",
        "Answer": "Yes, there is verifiable documentation and eyewitness testimony corroborating the presence of a shark in flooded areas during Hurricane Ian in Florida, although the specific claim of it being on a highway has not been definitively substantiated.\n\n1. Eyewitness Testimony: A local real estate agent named Dominic Cameratta confirmed he filmed a video showing a large fish thrashing around in a flooded backyard in Fort Myers. He initially did not identify it clearly but later concluded it resembled a shark after zooming in, echoing others' sentiments.\n\n2. Verification of Video Authenticity: The Associated Press and Storyful conducted analyses of the video metadata and interviewed Cameratta to confirm the origin of the footage. This due diligence helped establish that the video depicting the shark was indeed genuine, suggesting a real occurrence rather than a hoax.\n\n3. Context of Such Incidents: Past incidences of supposed sharks appearing in flooded urban areas have often been hoaxes, but the circumstances surrounding this instance, particularly the confirmation by reputable news sources and eyewitness accounts, lend credibility to this particular case. This event seems to have been an exception, as previous videos circulated were confirmed as fake.\n\nBased on this evidence and analysis, I would evaluate my confidence in the answer as 85%. While there is substantial verification surrounding the shark's presence, the specific claims of it being on a highway remain somewhat ambiguous, needing more contextual clarity.",
