Fox News host Sean Hannity was among those who shared low-resolution video on X, the social media app formerly known as Twitter. Hannity’s post was viewed more than 425,000 times within a few hours, and similar videos posted by others received thousands more views on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok. Higher-resolution from the nonpartisan network C-SPAN shows that Biden looked downward for about 10 seconds while he was seated at a table. In the video, Biden watches someone who’s speaking, coughs, looks downward and then nods in agreement with the speaker. Then he looks up again. He later delivered a speech to the same audience. The higher-resolution video shows that Biden kept his eyes open for most of the time he was looking downward. His open eyes aren’t clearly visible in the lower-quality videos. At least one member of Congress, Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, also shared the lower-resolution version on X. A spokesperson for Nehls said in a statement: “Everyone with eyes can draw their own conclusion about whether President Biden was nodding off in the video.” Asked for comment about the Maui videos, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in an email: “It’s unfortunate they feel the need to lie. Instead, they should join him in supporting the people of Maui.” The posts on the country’s largest social media platforms, which largely appear to be spreading unchecked, are the latest test of how Silicon Valley will handle misinformation in the 2024 election cycle — and whether it will enforce its own policies. Low-quality videos are an example of what some misinformation researchers call “”: media that can mislead people through simple techniques, ... [Content truncated]",

The entire population there are shouting - 'Fk Joe Biden.' #MauiFires,\" says an August 21, 2023 post sharing the video on Twitter, which has rebranded as \"X.\" Similar posts spread in multiple languages across X and other platforms, including Facebook, TikTok and Telegram, after Biden traveled to Hawaii on August 21 to tour the deadliest wildfires the United States has seen in more than a century. The Democrat's visit came nearly two weeks after the historic town of Lahaina was leveled, killing at least 114 people. But the clip has been altered to add the insulting chant. It appears to have originated with \"il Donaldo Trumpo,\" a popular pro-Donald Trump account that has previously shared other videos targeting Biden with similarly manipulated audio. The footage is lifted from C-SPAN, which posted an identical recording to X of Biden walking alongside First Lady Jill Biden, Hawaii Governor Josh Green and Hawaii First Lady Jaime Green (archived here). The C-SPAN video shows the group passing the same charred car ruins as they walked toward a podium where Biden spoke, but it does not feature any chanting of expletives. President Biden and First Lady Dr. Biden tour Lahaina Streets. https://t.co/LTx6vGgZM2pic.twitter.com/bF0RSKYsXK No such chant is audible in footage of the same moment captured by AFP and other news organizations, including The Washington Post. AFP contacted the White House for comment, but no response was forthcoming. An AFP photojournalist who captured photos and video on the ground in Maui also observed no protesters or anti-Biden chanting as the president surveyed the damage and approached the outdoor podium.

Though all current evidence points to an accidental start, potentially exacerbated by negligence, much discourse online suggested something far more sinister: that the creation of large-scale wildfires on the island of Maui was part of a secret plan. The reasons suggested for this plan varied, from the purported desire of the federal government to “fake” climate change impacts, to the claim that particular elites desired to burn long-standing landholders off of their property to expand their land holdings. On the platform formerly known as Twitter (now X), where much of the discourse centered on the idea that the government had used a “direct energy weapon” to start the fire, discourse participants engaged in conspiracy theory construction, poring over videos, photos, maps, and planning documents, constructing a grand, interconnected argument from dozens of pieces of “evidence.” The discourse was prominent enough that for a time X’s top autocomplete suggestion for “maui fires” was “maui fires deliberate.” With conversation on X, as measured by the search results, overrun by such theories we became interested in what discourse on other platforms looked like. In this Center for an Informed Public rapid research report, we look at YouTube content discussing the fire’s causes through two methods. First, using a search term set expanded by ChatGPT, we identified videos related to the cause of the fires through scanning search results on X for YouTube links. Second, we use that same set of terms to search directly through the YouTube interface. The data collection for this report was executed between August 22 and August 23, 2023, providing ...

Of course, it is a fantasy-the kind of fantasy that sustains political activism in an era where the roles of fan, consumer, and citizen are intertwined. A friend recently e-mailed me, without comment, a short video, edited together out of footage from newscasts and Trump’s hit TV show, The Apprentice. As I watched it, my first impression was that it was a fan-made spoof of reality television. Then, I watched more. Framed as a mock preview for The Apprentice, the narrator explains, “George W. Bush is assigned the task of being president. He drives the economy into the ground, uses lies to justify war, spends way over budget, and almost gets away with it until the Donald finds out.” The video cuts to a boardroom, where Trump is demanding to know “who chose this stupid concept” and then telling George W. that he’s fired. Donald’s disapproving look is crosscut with Bush shaking his head in disbelief and then disappointment. An announcer then intones: “Unfortunately, ‘The Donald’ can’t fire Bush for us. But we can do it ourselves. Join us at TrueMajority Action. We’ll fire Bush together, and have some fun along the way.” Just like those videos of that clumsy and overweight kid pretending to be a Jedi now making their way around the Web, or the “wassup” parodies that we all got a year or so ago, this is so funny you have to pass it on. TrueMajority is a grassroots organization, founded by Ben Cohen (of Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream). Its goals are to increase voter participation in the 2004 election and to rally support behind a progressive agenda. According to its website, the group ... [Content truncated]",

By Tiffany Hsu As natural disasters and extreme environmental conditions became more commonplace around the world this summer, scientists pointed repeatedly to a shared driver: climate change. Conspiracy theorists pointed to anything but. Some claimed falsely that the record-smashing heat waves blistering parts of North America, Europe and Asia were normal, and that they had been sensationalized as part of a globalist hoax. Others made up tales that cloud-seeding airplanes or a nearby dam, rather than torrential rains, had caused the unusually intense flooding in northern Italy (and in places like Vermont and Rwanda). The devastating wildfire on Maui this month produced especially ludicrous claims. Social media that racked up millions of views blamed the blaze on a “directed energy weapon” (the evidence: years-old footage not recorded in Hawaii). And as Florida braced this week for Hurricane Idalia, some people claimed incorrectly online that such storms are not affected by fossil fuel emissions. The unfounded claims that now regularly follow natural disasters and dangerous weather, contradicting a preponderance of scientific evidence, can often seem frivolous and fantastical. They persist, however — attracting large audiences and frustrating climate experts, who say the world has little time to evade a global warming catastrophe. The claims can start with blog posts paid for by the oil and gas industry, or from rumors shared among neighbors. Online forums are filled with comments in multiple languages that reject both the science behind fossil fuel emissions and the scientists’ authority. Sometimes, they are amplified by top politicians and pundits — the Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, for example, called climate change a “hoax” during the first primary debate last week. “It’s really one of ...

Biden had been attacked for an initial \"no comment\" after being asked about the death toll, and faced further scrutiny at a community event on Monday for making a joke that appeared to compare the deadly blaze with almost losing his '67 Corvette. Video from that same event this week, shared on social media, has since been used by conservative commentators to suggest Biden fell asleep as community leaders spoke. The Claim Several posts by conservative commentators on X, formerly Twitter, on August 22, 2023, suggested that Joe Biden fell asleep during an engagement event in Lahaina, Hawaii, which addressed the recent wildfires in Maui. A post by DC_Draino, since viewed more than 400,000 times, stated Biden \"just fell asleep during a ceremony in Hawaii honoring the hundreds of Americans killed by the fires.\" Trending Politics' Collin Rugg also sent a post, since viewed more than 560,000 times, which stated: \"Biden appears to briefly fall asleep during a ceremony in Maui honoring the hundreds of people who died.\" Another post by Fox News host Sean Hannity, since viewed more than 102,000 times, stated: \"Biden appears to fall asleep during a ceremony in Hawaii honoring the hundreds of Americans killed by the fires.\" The Facts The comments based on the clip shared on X, taken from the community event in Lahaina, Hawaii, are inaccurate. The clips, taken from a TV broadcast, are of particularly low quality, making it hard to tell whether the president's eyes are open or not. There is no way to tell from them whether he is sleeping and, alone, may well just ... [Content truncated]",

Now, many who lost homes and jobs wonder if there will be a place for them in Lahaina. By Jill Cowan and Michael Corkery Jill Cowan reported from Maui, Hawaii. For years, Lahaina has had everything that makes Hawaii special: sweeping views of the Pacific, a charming main street and a rich cultural heritage. Lahaina also has everything that makes Hawaii an increasingly difficult and frustrating place to live. Tourism dominates, putting pressure on the environment and disrupting daily life. Wealthy visitors drive home values to astonishing heights (the median home price in the Lahaina area is $1.7 million), placing homeownership out of reach for most permanent residents. Within its small patch of western Maui, the oceanfront community of 13,000 people — once a center of whaling and ancient Hawaiian power — contains all of the economic tensions that have simmered beneath Hawaii’s gorgeous surface for years. Those strains are being laid bare by the devastating and deadly wildfires that leveled Lahaina last week. Officials and residents stress that the fires did not discriminate, wiping out fancy vacation rentals and modest homes dating back to the days of Lahaina’s sugar plantations. Mick Fleetwood, a leader of the band Fleetwood Mac, lost his popular restaurant, Fleetwood’s on Front Street, and the staff members lost their employer.
