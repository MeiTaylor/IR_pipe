Fox News host Sean Hannity was among those who shared low-resolution video on X, the social media app formerly known as Twitter. Hannity’s post was viewed more than 425,000 times within a few hours, and similar videos posted by others received thousands more views on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok. Higher-resolution from the nonpartisan network C-SPAN shows that Biden looked downward for about 10 seconds while he was seated at a table. In the video, Biden watches someone who’s speaking, coughs, looks downward and then nods in agreement with the speaker. Then he looks up again. He later delivered a speech to the same audience. The higher-resolution video shows that Biden kept his eyes open for most of the time he was looking downward. His open eyes aren’t clearly visible in the lower-quality videos. At least one member of Congress, Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, also shared the lower-resolution version on X. A spokesperson for Nehls said in a statement: “Everyone with eyes can draw their own conclusion about whether President Biden was nodding off in the video.” Asked for comment about the Maui videos, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in an email: “It’s unfortunate they feel the need to lie. Instead, they should join him in supporting the people of Maui.” The posts on the country’s largest social media platforms, which largely appear to be spreading unchecked, are the latest test of how Silicon Valley will handle misinformation in the 2024 election cycle — and whether it will enforce its own policies.

        "Question": "Does the video accurately depict Trump visiting Maui after the August 2023 wildfires, or is it manipulated?",
        "Answer": "The video does not accurately depict Donald Trump visiting Maui after the August 2023 wildfires; it is manipulated. The footage being circulated is not from Maui but from Trump's visit to Beauregard, Alabama, in March 2019, following a tornado that struck the area. Multiple fact-checking sources confirm this misinformation. For example, Snopes highlights that the video incorrectly claims to show Trump in Maui while it actually features his visit after a tornado in Alabama, where he spoke with survivors in a church serving as a disaster relief center. Similarly, USA Today clarifies that the video shared on social media showing Trump with a FEMA truck and residents is old footage from Alabama, emphasizing that he has not visited Maui after the wildfires. Another source, Lead Stories, reinforces that as of August 19, 2023, Trump had not visited Maui following the wildfires, and it supports the conclusion that the viral video is outdated. Based on this thorough analysis of the evidence from reputable fact-checking websites, I am confident that the video is manipulated and does not depict Trump visiting Maui after the August 2023 wildfires.",
