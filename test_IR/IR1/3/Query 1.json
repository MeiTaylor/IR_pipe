Yuki Iwamura / AFP via Getty Images Former President Donald Trump published a video message to the people of Hawaii on Monday, using the opportunity to make political digs at President Joe Biden and voicing skepticism over any suggestion that the climate crisis was partly responsible for the devastation. “I would like to express my sympathy and warmest regards to the people of Hawaii,” , “and specifically all of those who have been so gravely and irreparably hurt by the tragedy of the wildfires in Maui, something the likes of which have seldom been seen anywhere at any time.” Trump then shifted gears, saying the catastrophe “should never have happened,” that the government “was not prepared” to deal with the wildfires, and claiming the aftermath “is going ...

The president and first lady Jill Biden arrived nearly two weeks after ferocious, wind-whipped blazes claimed at least 115 lives — and likely many more. They returned to the U.S. mainland later in the day, arriving in Reno, Nevada overnight en route to Lake Tahoe, where the Bidens are scheduled to vacation for several days.

He also met with community elders out of the earshot of reporters. In brief remarks, Mr. Biden said the federal government will be with the people of Maui for as long as they are needed, while being \"respectful\" of the sacred ground and wishes of the people of Maui. \"We're focused on what's next — that's rebuilding the long-term — rebuilding for long-term — and doing it together to help get us back on our feet,\" the ...

The president and his wife, first lady Jill Biden, arrived on the Hawaiian island on Monday - 13 days after the wildfires that claimed at least 114 lives and devastated the historic town of Lahaina. After touring, the damage, he promised the federal government would help Maui \"for as long as it takes\" to recover from the devastation. \"The country grieves with you, stands with you and will do everything possible to help you recover,\" he said in a speech, delivered next to a 150-year-old banyan tree in Old Lahaina which had been burned in the fires. \"Today it's burned, but it's still standing,\" Mr Biden said of the tree. !

I believe it's a very powerful symbol of what we can and will do to get through this crisis.\" **Criticism of Biden's response** It comes after Biden and his administration faced criticism over the response to the wildfires - the deadliest in the US in more than a century. A protester held out a banner urging \"relief for Maui now\" as the president's motorcade weaved through the streets of Lahaina, while another signed urged Mr Biden to \"listen to the people\". ![Image 3: A woman holds a sign as U.S. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden visit the fire-ravaged town of Lahaina on the island of Maui in Hawaii, U.S., August 21, 2023.

Robert Dyckman, 74, and Buddy Jantoc, 79, were the first to be named. On Wednesday night local time in Hawaii, County Maui officials confirmed Melva Benjamin, 71, Virginia Dofa, 90 and Alfredo Galinato, 79, were also killed in the fires. More than 1,000 people are estimated still to be missing. The fire, which destroyed the historic town of Lahaina within hours, has been followed by a slow and gruelling search for victims. Mr Jantoc's body was discovered at his home in an old people's home in Lahaina, the New York Times reported.

Another 20 canine teams are expected to join the search, said Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) Administrator Deanne Criswell on Wednesday. \"This is a really hard disaster. And this is a really difficult search operation,\" she told reporters in Washington DC. \"This is also going to be a very long and hard recovery.\" Previously on Tuesday evening, Governor Josh Green said 27% of the disaster site had been searched. In a televised address he warned the number of dead could climb significantly and even double over the next 10 days.
