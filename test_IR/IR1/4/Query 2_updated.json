The popularity of the film resulted in it becoming one of the most commercially successful silent films as well as one of the first films to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award. Janet Gaynor, Frank Borzage, and Benjamin Glazer won Oscars for their work on the film, specifically awards for Best Actress, Best Directing (Dramatic Picture), and Best Writing (Adaptation), respectively. \"Seventh Heaven\" also marked the first time often-paired stars Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell worked together.

Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001. On the campaign trail, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a \"disaster\" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so US troops out of the country.

Let's get out!\"But in September 2017, he agreed to send 3,000 extra troops to bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated. Earlier that year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat, targeting a tunnel complex near Afghanistan's border with Pakistan that was said to have been used by the so-called Islamic State group (IS).Around 100 IS militants were thought to have been killed in the huge blast and President Trump praised his armed forces for \"another successful job\".
