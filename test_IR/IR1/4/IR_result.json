The North Korean leader showed a big interest in rocket technology. In turn, Kim was full of praise for his host.

Find out what he has said about your country, which foreign leaders he has met or called since taking office, and which countries he has mentioned in his tweets. Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001. On the campaign trail, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a \"disaster\" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so US troops out of the country. Back in 2013, he tweeted: \"We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!\"But in September 2017, he agreed to send 3,000 extra troops to bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated. Earlier that year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat, targeting a tunnel complex near Afghanistan's border with Pakistan that was said to have been used by the so-called Islamic State group (IS).Around 100 IS militants were thought to have been killed in the huge blast and President Trump praised his armed forces for \"another successful job\". Afghan officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in Kabul, but former President Hamid Karzai said the country should not be used as a \"testing ground for new and dangerous weapons\". Mr Trump and Mr Ghani met during the UN General Assembly in September 2017 to discuss their commitment to combating terrorism and improving economic development opportunities for American companies in Afghanistan.

        "Question": "What were the specific interactions and toasts between Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin reported in other footage from the event?",
        "Answer": "During the meeting between Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin, several specific interactions and toasts were reported, particularly during a state dinner that concluded their formal discussions.\n\n1. **Warm Greetings and Handshakes**: Upon Kim's arrival, Putin warmly welcomed him with a handshake. The atmosphere was noted to be friendly and engaging, with both leaders sharing smiles and visible camaraderie as they interacted [Query 1_evidence 3].\n\n2. **Endorsement of Putin's Actions**: In his remarks, Kim Jong Un praised Putin's leadership and expressed full support for Russia's actions in Ukraine. He referred to Russia’s military efforts as a \"sacred struggle\" against Western imperialism, which underscores the cordial relations between the two leaders and the underlying strategic motivations for their meeting [Query 1_evidence 1].\n\n3. **Toasting at the State Dinner**: During the state dinner, Kim proposed a toast to Putin’s health, which prompted the crowd to stand to show their support. This gesture demonstrates not only the formalities typically associated with such diplomatic gatherings but also the intent to strengthen their bilateral ties through mutual respect and positive affirmations [Query 1_evidence 1].\n\n4. **Discussion of Military Cooperation**: The leaders discussed the potential for military cooperation, which includes possible arms dealings and assistance with North Korea's satellite program.
