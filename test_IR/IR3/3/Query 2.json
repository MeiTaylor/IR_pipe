But a closer look at a video clip showed the president was blinking and nodding as a speaker spoke. Biden wasn't sleeping. President Joe Biden’s critics often inspect his public appearances for signs that he is unfit to lead. A common is that he falls asleep during important events. The latest iteration is no different.Posting a clip on X, formerly Twitter, from an event with survivors of the recent , Fox News host Sean Hannity Aug. 22, \"Biden appears to fall asleep during a ceremony in Hawaii honoring the hundreds of Americans killed by the fires.\"Another X user the same video and wrote, \"Joe Biden appears to be sleeping while listening to survivors speak about ...

Though all current evidence points to an accidental start, potentially exacerbated by negligence, much discourse online suggested something far more sinister: that the creation of large-scale wildfires on the island of Maui was part of a secret plan. The reasons suggested for this plan varied, from the purported desire of the federal government to “fake” climate change impacts, to the claim that particular elites desired to burn long-standing landholders off of their property to expand their land holdings.On the platform formerly known as Twitter (now X), where much of the discourse centered on the idea that the government had used a “direct energy weapon” to start the fire, discourse participants engaged in conspiracy theory construction, poring over videos, photos, maps, and planning documents, constructing a grand, interconnected argument from dozens of pieces of “evidence.” The discourse was prominent enough that for a time X’s top autocomplete suggestion for “maui fires” was “maui fires deliberate.”With conversation on X, as measured by the search results, overrun by such theories we became interested in what discourse on other platforms looked like. In this Center for an Informed Public rapid research report, we look at YouTube content discussing the fire’s causes through two methods. First, using a search term set expanded by ChatGPT, we identified videos related to the cause of the fires through scanning search results on X for YouTube links. Second, we use that same set of terms to search directly through the YouTube interface. The data collection for this report was executed between August 22 and August 23, 2023, providing a view of the ... [Content truncated]",

Of course, it is a fantasy-the kind of fantasy that sustains political activism in an era where the roles of fan, consumer, and citizen are intertwined.A friend recently e-mailed me, without comment, a short video, edited together out of footage from newscasts and Trump’s hit TV show, The Apprentice. As I watched it, my first impression was that it was a fan-made spoof of reality television. Then, I watched more. Framed as a mock preview for The Apprentice, the narrator explains, “George W. Bush is assigned the task of being president. He drives the economy into the ground, uses lies to justify war, spends way over budget, and almost gets away with it until the Donald finds out.” The video cuts to a boardroom, where Trump is demanding to know “who chose this stupid concept” and then telling George W. that he’s fired. Donald’s disapproving look is crosscut with Bush shaking his head in disbelief and then disappointment.An announcer then intones: “Unfortunately, ‘The Donald’ can’t fire Bush for us. But we can do it ourselves. Join us at TrueMajority Action. We’ll fire Bush together, and have some fun along the way.” Just like those videos of that clumsy and overweight kid pretending to be a Jedi now making their way around the Web, or the “wassup” parodies that we all got a year or so ago, this is so funny you have to pass it on.TrueMajority is a grassroots organization, founded by Ben Cohen (of Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream). Its goals are to increase voter participation in the 2004 election and to rally support behind a progressive agenda. According to its website, the group has attracted more ... [Content truncated]",

Others made up tales that cloud-seeding airplanes or a nearby dam, rather than torrential rains, had caused the unusually intense flooding in northern Italy (and in places like Vermont and Rwanda). The devastating wildfire on Maui this month produced especially ludicrous claims. Social media that racked up millions of views blamed the blaze on a “directed energy weapon” (the evidence: years-old footage not recorded in Hawaii). And as Florida braced this week for Hurricane Idalia, some people claimed incorrectly online that such storms are not affected by fossil fuel emissions.The unfounded claims that now regularly follow natural disasters and dangerous weather, contradicting a preponderance of scientific evidence, can often seem frivolous and fantastical. They persist, however — attracting large audiences and frustrating climate experts, who say the world has little time to evade a global warming catastrophe.The claims can start with blog posts paid for by the oil and gas industry, or from rumors shared among neighbors. Online forums are filled with comments in multiple languages that reject both the science behind fossil fuel emissions and the scientists’ authority. Sometimes, they are amplified by top politicians and pundits — the Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, for example, called climate change a “hoax” during the first primary debate last week.“It’s really one of the worst challenges we have to deal with,” said ...
