Rating: ] A that frequently goes viral on social media is often presented as an awkward exchange between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin, betraying a lack of trust between the two. A popular account on X, for example, shared the clip in late 2023 with the caption \"Trust issues\": ! This video was manipulated. The portion appearing to show the two leaders placing their full drinks on the table after toasting is simply a clip of the two picking their glasses up played in reverse. The full shows the action as it occurred, and it ends with both leaders sipping from their drinks after their toast: This meeting occurred in Russia on April 25, 2019, following a breakdown of talks between former U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim over North Korea's nuclear program, with Putin attempting to serve as a mediator, as by The Washington Post: > Russian President Vladimir Putin emerged from his first summit with Kim Jong Un \\ saying that North Korea needs international security guarantees, not just U.S. pledges, to consider giving up its nuclear arsenal. > > Putin\u2019s call for more multinational involvement contrasts sharply with President Trump\u2019s strategy of one-on-one dialogue with the North Korean leader. It also reinforced North Korea\u2019s attempt to link security and sanctions relief as twin demands in negotiations over its nuclear program. Because the video was manipulated to suggest a sequence of events that did not happen, the claim is False. #### Sources ... [Content truncated]",

During the cold war, North Korea was Moscow\u2019s key ally in north-east Asia. But at that time, the North Koreans were, at best, poor supplicants to a mighty superpower. Today, Kim\u2019s hermit kingdom stands tall and proud as Russia\u2019s partner in crime. Putin\u2019s engagement with North Korea is as old as his presidency. But the relationship was generally more exotic than practical. Russia\u2019s real partner was , which consistently ranked among its top 10 trade partners, with nearly $30bn in trade volume in 2021. North Korea was never an attractive partner, and it was subject to very restrictive sanctions that Russia, as a permanent member of the UN security council, had helped craft. Until it invaded Ukraine, Russia tried to abide by them in letter and spirit. Everything changed with the invasion. In May 2022 \u2013 in a development that may foreshadow the beginning of the end for the North Korean sanctions regime \u2013 Russia (and China) vetoed a UN security council resolution that would penalise Pyongyang for another round of missile tests. In July 2022, Pyongyang recognised the Russian-occupied puppet republics of Donetsk and Luhansk (just over two months before their annexation by Russia made this recognition moot).

AILSA CHANG, HOST: Seven time zones east of Moscow today, Russian President Vladimir Putin greeted the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un. Russia had announced Kim was coming for this summit of two authoritarians, but details of the meeting's timing and location were kept secret until Kim's arrival in his armored train after a two-day journey from Pyongyang. NPR's Charles Maynes reports from Moscow that each leader is looking to gain something from the other.CHARLES MAYNES, BYLINE: Kim's state visit came at Putin's invitation. And the setting, once revealed, was clearly designed to impress. North Korea had recently failed to place its own spy satellites into orbit, so Putin chose the venue of Russia's new Vostochny Cosmodrome for the summit, welcoming Kim with a warm handshake and, later, a personal tour.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Non-English language spoken).MAYNES: As Putin looked on, officials from Roscosmos, the Russian space agency told Kim about the latest in Russian space technology. In fact, before Kim's arrival, Putin told reporters Russia would help North Korea's quest to launch a satellite. That's why we're here, said Putin. The North Korean leader showed a big interest in rocket technology. In turn, Kim was full of praise for his host. Speaking through an interpreter in official remarks before the press, Kim fully endorsed Russia's invasion of Ukraine, calling it part of a sacred struggle to defend Russia against Western imperialism. The day ended with a state dinner and remarks from both leaders.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SUPREME LEADER KIM JONG UN: (Speaking Korean).MAYNES: Through an interpreter, Kim toasted Putin's health...(SOUNDBITE OF CHAIRS MOVING)MAYNES: ...And the crowd rose to its feet as Kim called for ...
