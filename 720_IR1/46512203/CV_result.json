        "Question": "Does the video depict President Trump visiting Maui post-wildfires, or is it altered or misrepresented?",
        "Answer": "The video does not depict President Trump visiting Maui post-wildfires; rather, it is altered or misrepresented. The evidence indicates that the footage circulating on social media is actually from a 2019 visit by Trump to Beauregard, Alabama, following a tornado disaster, not from a recent trip to Maui after the wildfires. Several fact-checking sources have confirmed this: 1. Snopes states that the video is being misrepresented as showing Trump's visit to Maui. In reality, it is footage from a trip Trump made in 2019 to Alabama, where he addressed survivors of a tornado that had caused significant damage. 2. USA Today also affirms that Trump has not visited Maui following the devastating wildfires. The video in question shows events from his 2019 Alabama visit, specifically at a church serving as a disaster relief center, and not any recent visit to Hawaii. 3. Sportskeeda corroborates the claims made by the other sources, asserting that the video circulating as evidence of Trump's visit to Maui is indeed an old video from 2019, intended to mislead viewers about his presence in the aftermath of the wildfires.",
