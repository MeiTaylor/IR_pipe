I started my military career in May 2022, providing medical aid to wounded soldiers. I also had to carry the bodies of those who had passed away. At first, I thought of war in straightforward terms: It was all about life and death. Today, I think differently. War is just one more form of human life with all its characteristic features: laughter and tears, love and jealousy, laziness, courage and fear. Often this manifests in unexpected ways. For example, recently I was walking around Niu York \u2014 not the American metropolis but a Ukrainian village between Bakhmut and Avdiivka in the Donbas region, where war has been going on since 2014. Niu York is only a few miles away from the front line. Enemy mortar shells often land in the yards of local people, with horrible consequences. I was walking down the street when I heard a shell exploding a few hundred yards away \u2014 a 120mm mortar shell, by the sound of it. By force of habit, I threw myself to the ground. After a few seconds, I raised my head and saw an elderly man sitting on a nearby bench as though nothing had happened, holding a bouquet of lilacs. Explosion, dust, I\u2019m lying on the ground, and the guy is just sitting there with a bouquet in his hands. Shaking off the dust, I shouted: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you get on the ground? Aren\u2019t you afraid that you might be hurt by shrapnel?\u201d \u201cWhy should I get on the ground? I\u2019m not that young anymore. I\u2019d just make my clothes dirty. If it hits, it hits.\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s that for?\u201d I glanced at the bouquet of lilacs. \u201cFor my wife. I\u2019m ... [Content truncated]",

Some 5.3 million children face barriers preventing access to education, including 3.6 million children directly affected by school closures. This places children in Ukraine at risk of losing critical years of schooling and social development. Since February 2022, UNICEF has supported nearly 1.5 million of the most vulnerable children in Ukraine to access formal and non-formal education, including early learning. Since war began, over 2,600 schools have been damaged and over 400 destroyed across Ukraine, according to the Ministry of Education. Only approximately 25 per cent of Ukrainian schools nationwide have been able to offer full-time, in-person learning since September. In addition, UNICEF surveys show that fewer than a half of families with children under five-years-old were able to return to kindergarten and join educational activities. Damage to schools and power cuts following attacks on critical infrastructure have also hindered children\u2019s ability to access education in-person and online, putting the future for millions of children at risk. \u201cEvery child must have access to quality and safe education, even amidst the war. Education is critical to children\u2019s well-being and social development. It cannot be put on hold without risking the future of an entire generation. Lives of millions will be infinitely harder if we fail to help them continue their education now,\u201d emphasized UNICEF Ukraine Representative Murat Sahin. Beyond education, schools also play a critical role in the social development of children, which is critical for managing the psychosocial stressors and traumas that war brings. It provides a peer group where children can talk through problems, access to adults outside of the family environment to help with the processing of emotions, and a place ... [Content truncated]",

UNICEF has been part of the humanitarian response to the escalation of war in Ukraine since Day One, scaling up emergency operations alongside partners inside the country and in refugee transit and destination countries. More than 5.9 million people have fled Ukraine for safety in neighboring host countries and beyond \u2014 the largest displacement of people in Europe since World War II \u2014 while over 3.7 million people remain internally displaced. Active fighting continues in many of Ukraine's communities in the east and south, with an estimated 2.9 million people living at or near the front lines. Children continue to suffer under relentless attacks. Since February 2022, 579 children have been killed and 1,284 children have been injured. Thousands of schools, hospitals and homes have been damaged or destroyed, along with critical water and energy infrastructure, putting children\u2019s lives and well-being at risk.

To make Ukraine a fit country for heroes to live in.\u201d A Ukrainian official said that to me in Kyiv a few weeks ago, playing off of the famous quote from British Prime Minister David Lloyd George. It\u2019s a fitting statement for a country struggling terribly to keep itself from being wiped off the map, yet at the same time building a resilient and proud nation in the hearts of every citizen. Amid the devastation and loss is a pervasive national dream for what comes next. In Ukraine, no one says \u201cafter the war\u201d\u2013\u2013only \u201cafter the victory.\u201d I recently returned from Ukraine where RDI led a delegation of Americans involved in supporting the war effort, including prominent writers and former government officials (including our very own Board President, Senator Heidi Heitkamp). Our goals in Ukraine were simple.
