Some 5.3 million children face barriers preventing access to education, including 3.6 million children directly affected by school closures. This places children in Ukraine at risk of losing critical years of schooling and social development. Since February 2022, UNICEF has supported nearly 1.5 million of the most vulnerable children in Ukraine to access formal and non-formal education, including early learning. Since war began, over 2,600 schools have been damaged and over 400 destroyed across Ukraine, according to the Ministry of Education. Only approximately 25 per cent of Ukrainian schools nationwide have been able to offer full-time, in-person learning since September. In addition, UNICEF surveys show that fewer than a half of families with children under five-years-old were able to return to kindergarten and join educational activities. Damage to schools and power cuts following attacks on critical infrastructure have also hindered children\u2019s ability to access education in-person and online, putting the future for millions of children at risk. \u201cEvery child must have access to quality and safe education, even amidst the war. Education is critical to children\u2019s well-being and social development. It cannot be put on hold without risking the future of an entire generation. Lives of millions will be infinitely harder if we fail to help them continue their education now,\u201d emphasized UNICEF Ukraine Representative Murat Sahin. Beyond education, schools also play a critical role in the social development of children, which is critical for managing the psychosocial stressors and traumas that war brings. It provides a peer group where children can talk through problems, access to adults outside of the family environment to help with the processing of emotions, and a place ... [Content truncated]",

These polls were published from 27 September until 5 October 2022. Key findings are based on one multi-countries survey as well as on surveys conducted in Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland and Slovakia. Polls from Ukraine and Russia are also presented. The EU and NATO are considered important for national security: A recent poll carried out across ten member states and their transatlantic partners, found that on average 81% of the EU citizens surveyed believe the EU is important for the national security of their country. The plurality of respondents in almost all the EU countries surveyed say that relations with Russia would be best managed through the EU. The same survey found that the share of respondents saying that NATO plays an important role in the security of their country is 78%, an increase of 11 points from 2021. Overall, 65% of respondents describe the EU\u2019s influence as very or generally positive. This picuture is confirmed by another survey carried out in France, which found that confidence in the EU is increasing markedly in the context of multiple crisis. In Poland, pollsters found that 60% of respondents want the NATO to go further by providing even more weapons and heavy equipment for Ukrainian troops. Support for Ukraine is mostly stable: A multi-country survey found clear support for Ukraine becoming a member of the EU (63%) and of NATO (58%) among respondents. Ukrainians themselves are even more positive about these prospects, according to this survey . 86% are in favour of their country joining the EU, while ... [Content truncated]",

Policy stances toward humanitarian protection have similarly ping-ponged between greater openness and restriction, with access to protection narrowing during the global pandemic while at the same time expanding in important ways in response to high-profile displacement from Venezuela, Afghanistan, and most recently, Ukraine. While some leaders have leveraged fears around COVID-19 to push through more restrictive policies, others have shown incredible creativity in regularizing large displaced populations and ...

Geo and chrono-located smartphone footage of military aggression under occupation can now spread through social media and even serve as evidence in international tribunals.

Both Russia and Ukraine have used every tool available to them and employed distinct tactics to shape public perceptions as the war continues.

Pictures from Ukraine by combat photographers, including contract photographer James Nachtwey and Associated Press photojournalists Felipe Dana, Mstyslav Chernov and Evgeniy Maloletka, have brought to light the horrific consequences of Russia\u2019s invasion and the unconscionable treatment of innocent civilians. Fifty years ago, I was in the same position as those photographers, working for the Associated Press in Vietnam.
