Media can also play a big role in how people see the world around them and how they interpret important international events, including war and conflict. As the Israel-Hamas war continues, we asked , journalist and , to analyze differences between how US media and international news outlets are covering the conflict and discuss how media coverage can impact how the public perceives war. Coverage of the Israel-Hamas war has been constant since the start of the conflict on October 7. What have you observed about how US media outlets are approaching this conflict? How does this compare to how news outlets based outside of the US are covering the war? Hamas’ horrific October 7 attack on Israel made headlines for several days, and the media still covers personal stories about individual hostages. However, the attack and Hamas’s nature as a terrorist group have been eclipsed by coverage of Palestinian causalities suffered in Gaza, as they are more current, far greater in numbers, and are captured in daily videos on television. The conflict has been cruel and tragic to everyone, but US media is often crisis-oriented and covers the war as a “play by play,” as opposed to presenting a broader picture of the impact of the conflict. American coverage of the military campaign tends to lean towards the Israeli and American governments’ narratives, sometimes at the expense of adequately representing Palestinian viewpoints. The number of Palestinian causalities is often reported with a caveat that numbers come from the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, as if to cast doubt on their legitimacy.

    "QA": {
        "Question": "What evidence shows how leisure activities in Kyiv during the war impact the perception of the conflict’s severity and reality?",
        "Answer": "Leisure activities in Kyiv during the ongoing war significantly impact the perception of the conflict's severity and reality in several ways. Firstly, the existence of vibrant social scenes, such as beach parties and nightlife, can create a misleading narrative regarding the overall situation in Ukraine. For instance, videos and images showing busy beaches in Kyiv have led some individuals to believe that the war is exaggerated or less severe than reported. This sentiment was notably expressed in social media posts claiming that the scenes of leisure contradict the portrayal of Ukraine as a war-torn country, thus suggesting that there may not be a legitimate conflict occurring. Such perceptions can stem from the fact that different regions within Ukraine experience varied levels of conflict intensity, with Kyiv situated more than 300 miles from the active front lines. This geographic difference contributes to the difficulty in visualizing the war's immediate impact on day-to-day life in the capital where social activities continue. Secondly, social media reactions to leisure activities during the war often lead to skepticism regarding the necessity of Western support for Ukraine. The cheerful atmosphere depicted in leisure videos fosters doubts about the severity of the war and invites questions about media narratives surrounding the conflict. For instance, several social media engagements echo skepticism about the media's portrayal of the war in light of images showing people enjoying summer days. This demonstrates how leisure activities can inadvertently alter public perception, leading individuals to believe that the situation in Ukraine may not warrant the level of international assistance it receives. In summary, while leisurely activities in Kyiv reflect the resilience of its citizens and their desire to maintain a semblance of normality amid conflict, they also contribute to a distorted perception of the war's severity. The ongoing enjoyment of life in one area does not negate the serious and complex realities of the conflict being faced in other regions of the country.",
