Credit...Natalie Keyssar for The New York Times Credit...Natalie Keyssar for The New York Times * Sept. 13, 2023 Late on a muggy evening in mid-July, Samantha Power, administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, and Bridget Brink, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, boarded a night train from Kyiv to Odesa, accompanied by a few staff members and a discreet security detail. Earlier that day, Ukrainian naval drones had damaged the bridge connecting Russia to occupied Crimea, the second such attack of the war. Hours later, the Kremlin announced it would not renew the Black Sea Grain Initiative, a deal brokered last year by Turkey and the United Nations that, in a little less than a year, had allowed Ukraine to export nearly 33 million tons of grain from its three major remaining ports. By the time the train pulled into Odesa the next morning, the city and surrounding areas had endured a night of ferocious Russian attacks: approximately 25 Iranian-made drones and several cruise missiles, according to a Ukrainian official. The attacks would keep coming, blowing off the roof of a cathedral, destroying a wholesale market, and \u2014 roughly 24 hours after Power\u2019s own visit to it \u2014 damaging a stately Sea Port Administration building near the seafront. The port itself was silent: no ships, no cargo, no people. Odesa is a principal lifeline not only for Ukraine\u2019s heavily agricultural economy, but also for millions of people in some of the world\u2019s poorest countries. In Vladimir Putin\u2019s effort to blockade Ukraine, he\u2019s also pushing millions of vulnerable people toward hunger. Image !

It started as a small university job, which then turned into a full-time job when I dropped out of higher education. The money was great, and I loved the atmosphere, but the antisocial work hours were rather undesirable as a teetotal non-drinker. In February 2022, after working six or seven nights a week for months, I began to burn out and lose my passion, which led me to start searching for something new. On the night of February 23rd, 2022, I was working one of my regular nightclub photography jobs at Kuda York. From what I remember of this particular shift, the night was fairly uneventful, and everything was business as usual. That was until my shift came to an end around 3 am on the morning of the 24th, when news was just breaking online that Russia had once again violated Ukraine's borders, and a full-scale invasion had begun. The news made me want to do something to help, but I had no idea what I could do. It wasn't until a conversation over dinner in early March with my friend Sean that I realized that I didn't need to pick up a weapon to help Ukraine, but I could use my camera to tell stories instead. Images are my weapon. Sean introduced me to his friend Ondrej, who had documented the war before the escalation last year. He invited me to join him in Poland to document the refugee crisis. Around 10 days later, I was in Poland at the Ukraine border crossing, witnessing the mass exodus of refugees fleeing the war firsthand. Soon after arriving, I realized the gravity of ...

The Arttalkers Toastmasters club based in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, posted a simple message to its members on the Telegram Messenger app that day: Dear all, taking into account the situation, no meetings for now. Please stay safe and donate money to volunteers. At that time, Calin Gilea, DTM, was the District 110 Director. A member of the Timisoara English Speakers in western Romania, he was in the midst of visiting clubs in his District and had been pricing out flights to visit clubs in Ukraine just before the war began. Gilea knew the importance of Toastmasters in people\u2019s lives and felt that maintaining continuity would be important. \u201cI knew that I had to act,\u201d he says. He proposed using funds from a District Reserve account to cover dues for members of the nine Ukrainian clubs. However, it was not an option, as organizational regulations restrict use of operational funds for paying member dues. Ultimately, the Toastmasters International Board of Directors approved use of funds from the Ralph C. Smedley Memorial Fund\u00ae to renew the dues of approximately 170 Toastmasters in Ukraine. In the meantime, offers of help from Toastmasters and others came in, including opportunities to shelter in western Ukraine or neighboring countries. Information was shared about European countries whose governments were offering asylum to Ukrainians. On February 27, only a few days after the first attack, Gilea sent a message via Facebook to the members of District 110. He reported that he had been in contact with Toastmasters leadership in Ukraine and that a plan to directly assist members was in ... [Content truncated]",

It has been more than a year since my last visit, and I have been looking forward to being able to, eventually, reconnect with partners and friends \u2013 and witness the impact of the war with my own eyes. Every single day, Ukrainians pay a high price for the right to live in an independent country, a country which has chosen a path towards EU integration. I admire their tenacity. Recently, more than 16 months since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, I finally found myself with a train ticket to Kyiv \u2013 the only possible way to travel these days. With the wheels clicking steadily on steel tracks I was reminded of childhood train trips from Armenia to the Black Sea. Only this time I was not travelling to enjoy the beach. I went to a country at war, with air raid sirens going off almost every night. I experienced some of the terror that Ukrainians live through on a day-to-day basis.

Every morning at the hotel and out on streets I would listen to people discus events of the previous night. ... [Content truncated]",

Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv's military administration, said on Telegram that a barrage of ammunition was fired by Shahed drones over the capital. \"The enemy's UAVs were launched by many groups and came to attack Kyiv in waves, from different directions, while constantly changing the vectors of movement along the route,\" Popko said. Air raid sirens were sounded several times in Kyiv, and no casualties or critical damage were recorded in the city according to currently available information, he added. Ukrainian servicemen of the 123rd Territorial Defense Brigade prepare to fire a mortar over the Dnipro River toward Russian positions, in an undisclosed location in the Kherson region, on November 6, 2023, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. While Ukraine's recapture of Kherson city last November was a shock defeat for the Kremlin, Russian forces on the opposing bank still control swathes of territory and shell towns and villages they retreated from. The Dnipro, Europe's fourth-longest river and a historic trading route, has become a key front since Ukrainian troops pushed Russian forces back over its banks in the south last year.

Residents were woken by explosions before dawn on Saturday, and for more than six hours, the booms of Kyiv's air defences echoed through the city. There was wave after wave of attacks from the north and east. Officials said more than 75 Iranian-made Shahed drones were fired at the capital - all but one were shot down.

A kindergarten was among the buildings damaged. For several quiet weeks, Moscow had been suspected of stockpiling missiles. That abruptly ended this morning.

As winter continues to bite, it had been feared that Russia would resume its tactic of targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure. With 16,000 homes being left without ... [Content truncated]",

The room was heavy with an air of frustration. Austin, in his deliberate baritone, asked Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov about Ukraine\u2019s decision-making in the opening days of its long-awaited counteroffensive, pressing him on why his forces weren\u2019t using Western-supplied mine-clearing equipment to enable a larger, mechanized assault, or using smoke to conceal their advances. Despite Russia\u2019s thick defensive lines, Austin said, the Kremlin\u2019s troops weren\u2019t invincible. 1/3 Reznikov, a bald, bespectacled lawyer, said Ukraine\u2019s military commanders were the ones making those decisions. But he noted that Ukraine\u2019s armored vehicles were being destroyed by Russian helicopters, drones and artillery with every attempt to advance.

The meeting in Brussels, less than two weeks into the campaign, illustrates how a counteroffensive born in optimism has failed to deliver its expected punch, generating friction and second-guessing between Washington and Kyiv and raising deeper questions about Ukraine\u2019s ability to retake decisive amounts of territory. As winter approaches, and the front lines freeze into place, Ukraine\u2019s most senior military officials acknowledge that the war has reached a stalemate. This examination of the lead-up to Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive is based on interviews with more than 30 senior officials from Ukraine, the United States and European nations. It provides new insights and previously unreported details about America\u2019s deep involvement in the military planning behind the counteroffensive and ... [Content truncated]",
