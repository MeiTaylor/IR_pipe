At least five people were killed, including three children, in a Ukrainian attack on Crimea on Sunday, according to the Russian defence ministry, which said the supply of missiles made the United States responsible for the attack. One person was also killed and ten others wounded by Russian strikes on Ukraine’s eastern city of Kharkiv, regional governor Oleh Synehubov said. The Ukrainian attack on the Russian-occupied Crimean peninsula was conducted with five US-supplied Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles, the Russian defence ministry said. It added that four had been shot down, and that a fifth had detonated in mid-air. The ministry claimed that US specialists had set the missiles’ flight coordinates on the basis of information from US spy satellites. There has been no response from the US, which began supplying Ukraine with the missiles earlier this year. Footage aired on Russian state television showed people running from a beach and some people being carried off sun loungers. Authorities in Crimea said missile fragments had fallen near a beach on the north side of the city of Sevastopol. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, though most of the world still considers the territory part of Ukraine. Separately, in the Belgorod region, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram that one person was killed and three wounded after Ukrainian drones hit the Russian town of Graivoron. At least 30 drones were destroyed over Russia’s western region of Bryansk, which borders Ukraine, Governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram. No damage was reported. Russia’s air defence systems also destroyed drones over the Smolensk region, Vasily Anokhin, governor of the region in Russia’s west, said on Telegram. ### Sign up for Al Jazeera #### Weekly Newsletter The latest news from ...

A video of Ukrainians partying at a beach club has gone viral amid a debate overseas about whether or not the United States and the West should support any for the war. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, the U.S. has committed to more than $60 billion in , the most of any of Kyiv's Western allies.

It could have been a scene from almost anywhere. But it's not anywhere — it's Kharkiv, not far from the Russian border in eastern , and within easy reach of missiles and airstrikes. While many buildings remain boarded up in Ukraine's second largest city, the remote yet real possibility of dying hasn't stopped many of its residents from living. Among those who have refused to cower from Russia's war, are 20-year-old student George Soldutenko and his friends, Nicolai and Andrei. !

You know how sports memorabilia stores sometimes sell basketballs autographed by an entire N.B.A. team? Well, I was imagining that Donald Trump could sell white flags at $1,000 a pop that say, “We surrendered Ukraine to Russia,” autographed by him and the House and Senate MAGA sycophants he’s assembled to deny Ukrainians the weapons they need to stave off Vladimir Putin’s onslaught. For an extra $500, you could get a white flag autographed solely by Trump and J.D. Vance and emblazoned with Vance’s immortal words, “I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine.” Or one signed by House Speaker Mike Johnson, big enough to sum up his worldview: I was for Ukraine aid until I was against it, but I could be for it again if Trump is not against it. This is a matter of principle for me. Either way, it’s all Biden’s fault. And then the ultimate collector’s item. For an extra $1,000, a giant white surrender flag, made from the softest Sea Island cotton, signed by Lindsey Graham, that says: “I gave up the principles of John McCain and a free Ukraine because Trump told me to. But I got a round of golf at Trump’s West Palm Beach course. Can I still be on ‘Meet the Press’?” The last gift comes with a pair of Trump’s new branded tennis shoes, guaranteed by Trump and personally tested by Graham, to be the fastest shoe on the market to run away from any ally or foe — or anything principled that you’ve ever said. The possibilities are endless, because Trump’s G.O.P. has become bottomless. It now manifests an infinite willingness to engage in any form of ... [Content truncated]",
