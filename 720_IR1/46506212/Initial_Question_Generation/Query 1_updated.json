At least five people were killed, including three children, in a Ukrainian attack on Crimea on Sunday, according to the Russian defence ministry, which said the supply of missiles made the United States responsible for the attack. One person was also killed and ten others wounded by Russian strikes on Ukraine\u2019s eastern city of Kharkiv, regional governor Oleh Synehubov said. The Ukrainian attack on the Russian-occupied Crimean peninsula was conducted with five US-supplied Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles, the Russian defence ministry said. It added that four had been shot down, and that a fifth had detonated in mid-air. The ministry claimed that US specialists had set the missiles\u2019 flight coordinates on the basis of information from US spy satellites. There has been no response from the US, which began supplying Ukraine with the missiles earlier this year. Footage aired on Russian state television showed people running from a beach and some people being carried off sun loungers. Authorities in Crimea said missile fragments had fallen near a beach on the north side of the city of Sevastopol. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, though most of the world still considers the territory part of Ukraine. Separately, in the Belgorod region, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram that one person was killed and three wounded after Ukrainian drones hit the Russian town of Graivoron. At least 30 drones were destroyed over Russia\u2019s western region of Bryansk, which borders Ukraine, Governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram. No damage was reported. Russia\u2019s air defence systems also destroyed drones over the Smolensk region, Vasily Anokhin, governor of the region in Russia\u2019s west, said on Telegram. ### Sign up for Al Jazeera #### Weekly Newsletter The latest news from ...

You know how sports memorabilia stores sometimes sell basketballs autographed by an entire N.B.A. team? Well, I was imagining that Donald Trump could sell white flags at $1,000 a pop that say, \u201cWe surrendered Ukraine to Russia,\u201d autographed by him and the House and Senate MAGA sycophants he\u2019s assembled to deny Ukrainians the weapons they need to stave off Vladimir Putin\u2019s onslaught. For an extra $500, you could get a white flag autographed solely by Trump and J.D. Vance and emblazoned with Vance\u2019s immortal words, \u201cI don\u2019t really care what happens to Ukraine.\u201d Or one signed by House Speaker Mike Johnson, big enough to sum up his worldview: I was for Ukraine aid until I was against it, but I could be for it again if Trump is not against it.

Can I still be on \u2018Meet the Press\u2019?\u201d The last gift comes with a pair of Trump\u2019s new branded tennis shoes, guaranteed by Trump and personally tested by Graham, to be the fastest shoe on the market to run away from any ally or foe \u2014 or anything principled that you\u2019ve ever said. The possibilities are endless, because Trump\u2019s G.O.P. has become bottomless. It now manifests an infinite willingness to engage in any form of ... [Content truncated]",
