Nelson, FAIA \nu.s. Department of the Interior National Park Service Cultural Resources Heritage Preservation Services \nThe Secretary of the Interior 's \"S tandards for Historic Preservation Projects\" embody two important goals: 1) the preservation of historic materials and, 2) the preservation of a building 's distinguishing character. Every old building is unique, with its own identity and its own distinctive character. Character refers to all those visual aspects and physical features that comprise the appearance of every historic building. Character-defining elements include the overall shape of the building, its materials, craftsmanship, decorative details, interior spaces and features, as well as the various aspects of its site and environment. \nThe purpose of this Brief is to help the owner or the architect identify those features or elements that give the building its visual character and that should be taken into account in order to preserve them to the max-imum extent possible. \nThere are different ways of understanding old buildings. They can be seen as examples of specific building types, which are usually related to a building's function, such as schools, courthouses or churches. Buildings can be studied as examples of using specific materials such as concrete, wood, steel, or limestone. They can also be considered as examples of an historical period, which is often related to a specific ar-chitectural style, such as Gothic Revival farmhouses, one-story bungalows, or Art Deco apartment buildings. \nThere are many other facets of an historic building besides its functional type, its materials or construction or style that contribute to its historic qualities or significance. Some of these qualities are feelings con-veyed by the sense of time and place or in buildings associated with events or people. A complete understanding of any property may require documen-tary research about its style, construction, function, its furnishings or...[Content truncated]",

Virtual environments and immersive games (such as, Second Life, Fortnite, Roblox and VRChat) have been described as antecedents of the metaverse and offer some insight to the potential socio-economic impact of a fully functional persistent cross platform metaverse. Separating the hype and \u201cmeta\u2026\u201d rebranding from current reality is difficult, as \u201c_big tech_\u201d paints a picture of the transformative nature of the metaverse and how it will positively impact people in their work, leisure, and social interaction. The potential impact on the way we conduct business, interact with brands and others, and develop shared experiences is likely to be transformational as the distinct lines between physical and digital are likely to be somewhat blurred from current perceptions. However, although the technology and infrastructure does not yet exist to allow the development of new immersive virtual worlds at scale - one that our avatars could transcend across platforms, researchers are increasingly examining the transformative impact of the metaverse. Impacted sectors include marketing, education, healthcare as well as societal effects relating to social interaction factors from widespread adoption, and issues relating to trust, privacy, bias, disinformation, application of law as well as psychological aspects linked to addiction and impact on vulnerable people. This study examines these topics in detail by combining the informed narrative and multi-perspective approach from experts with varied disciplinary backgrounds on many aspects of the metaverse and its transformational impact. The paper concludes by proposing a future research agenda that is valuable for researchers, professionals and policy makers alike.\nKeywords\n--------\nAvatars\nAugmented reality\nExtended reality\nMetaverse\nSecond life\nVirtual reality\nVirtual world\nCited by (0)\n------------\nAuthors have made equal contributions.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

Going to the mountains or seashore for recreation was becoming a growing trend; Winter gardens and conservatories become requisites of wealthy homes in Europe and the United States. Henry David Thoreau built a cabin by Walden Pond in Concord, Massachusetts from which he wrote treatises on a simpler life, connected to nature, which still resonate in the American consciousness. In hospital design, sunlight and a view to nature was believed to be important, as can be seen at St. Elizabeth\u2019s in Washington, D.C. Designed in the 1850s to the concepts of Dr. Thomas Kirkbride, who \u201c\u2026believed that the beautiful setting\u2026restored patients to a more natural balance of the senses\u201d ( ).\n!\nImage \u00a9 Teomancimit.\nAnimal stone carvings at the ancient G\u00f6bekli Tepe.\n!\nImage \u00a9 Devyn Caldwell/Flickr.\nThe play of volumes and glass in Mies Van Der Rohe\u2019s Farnsworth House.\nInspiration from nature was in full view in the Art Nouveau designs of the late 19th Century. Architect Victor Horta\u2019s exuberant plant tendrils lacing through buildings in Belgium, the lush flowers that are Louis Comfort Tiffany lamps, and the explicitly biomorphic forms of Antonio Gaud\u00ed\u2019s buildings all remain strong examples. In Chicago, Louis Sullivan created elaborate ornamentation with leaves and cornices that represent tree branches. His prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Frank Lloyd Wright, is part of the group that launched The Prairie School.\nWright abstracted prairie flowers and plants for his art glass windows and ornamentation. Like many in the Craftsman movement, Wright used the grain of wood and texture of brick and stone as a decorative element. Wright also opened up interiors to flow through houses in ways that had not been done before, creating prospect views balanced with intimate refuges. His later designs sometimes include exhilarating spaces, like the balcony cantilevering out over the waterfall at Fallingwater.\nEuropean Modernists stripped much ornamentation from their buildings, but, like Wright, used wood grain and the veining of stone as decorative elements and were equally concerned with exploring the relationship of interior to exterior. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe\u2019s Barcelona Pavilion (built 1929) pushed that concept in the play...[Content truncated]",

This, after the screening processes based on the inclusion criteria, led to the final inclusion of 31 papers related specifically to the OECD area. The review allowed the identification of five housing conditions \\ that, by influencing the IEQ parameters, had impacts on the mental health outcomes addressed. By synthesizing the contributions of the review, a list of design recommendations has been provided. These will serve as a basis for future researchers, from which to develop measures to reduce inequalities in housing by making them healthier, more resilient, and salutogenic.\n**Keywords:** architectural features, housing conditions, indoor environmental quality, mental health, design recommendations\n1\\. Introduction\n----------------\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on the 30 January 2020 because it has spread to such an extent worldwide, affecting a great number of people \\\\]. The restricted measures of societal lockdowns, which almost every country put in place, undoubtedly reduced the impact of the pandemic \\\\]. At the same time, they have been detrimental to the quality of life, both physical and mental. Indeed, throughout the pandemic and related lockdowns, time spent at home increased to a great extent \\\\].\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the population spent 60% of their time at home \\\\]. Now it is well-known that humans spend over 85% of their time in indoor settings. In fact, the COVID-19 transformed the daily lives of millions of people \\\\] during its worst outbreaks. It also left permanent changes in our way of living, working, studying, interacting, etc. \\,\\].\nFurthermore, it is well-established that 55% of the population lives in urban versus rural environments, a trend that has been increased by 30% since 1950 \\\\]. If urbanization continues this way, as expected, it is estimated that by 2050 around 70% of the population will live in urban environments \\\\]. In addition to the positive benefits of living in urban areas (such as greater access to healthcare, improved educational opportunities, higher wages, etc.) \\\\], the time spent indoor will increase. Indeed, urban areas usually lack opportunities to have large amounts of contact with nature, compared to rural ones \\\\].\nTherefore, since in the immediate future we are likely to continue spending more time in confined spaces, the role of the built environments in which we live has become of the utmost importance, as the pandemic has strongly highlighted \\\\].

Yet the picture is nuanced, and top-tier American malls are outperforming.\nHeadlines, online columns, YouTube channels and even entire websites dedicated to dying malls have populated the media over the past decade. Then, in 2020, the pandemic hit, devastating all malls across America as they were forced to close.\nSince the lifting of restrictions and consumers\u2019 gradual return to more normal ways of living, physical retail has bounced back, with 2022 seeing  more store openings than closures for the first time since 2016.\nIn this report, we present data-driven research into the American mall format, analyzing recent occupancy rates and revenue growth of top-tier malls. We explore the reasons behind the robust performance of malls, analyzing the halo effect of omnichannel, rising online customer acquisition and marketing costs, changing consumption patterns and more.\nFor our analysis in this report, we define mall tiers as below:\n*   **Top-tier malls**: malls featuring luxury retailers and newer direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands; often located in moreaffluent areas where a typical shopper has an annual income of over $200,000 (based on census block median household income of mobile phone location data for a plurality of mall visitors)\n*   **Mid-tier malls**: malls that have anchor retailers and few or no vacancies; located in moderately affluent neighborhoods where a typical shopper has an annual income of around $100,000\n*   **Low-tier malls**: malls that have an empty anchor, declining sales and a less-affluent customer demographic\nMarket Scale and Opportunity\n----------------------------\nAccording to data from ICSC (formerly the International Council of Shopping Centers), malls make up a shrinking proportion of total US retail gross leasable brick-and-mortar area\u2014down to 5.5% in 2023 from 5.7% in 2014. This contraction is driven by low-tier malls, which were closing before the pandemic and many of which continue to struggle today due to stiff competition from e-commerce and other shopping centers, as well as their inability to attract retailers and brands that customers desire at the mall. Other retail formats, such as open-air shopping centers, have also drawn customers away from underperforming malls due to a similar retailer makeup.\nICSC estimates that 12.9% of US consumer expenditure on retail goods, food services and other retail-adjacent services went through malls in the first quarter of 2023\u2014meaning malls capture a...[Content truncated]",
