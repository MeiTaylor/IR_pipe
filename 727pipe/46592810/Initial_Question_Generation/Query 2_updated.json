He's coming for you!\"\nFarrow, son of Mia Farrow, worked a number of expos\u00e9s on Harvey Weinstein's sexual misconduct. Disgraced movie producer Weinstein was last February sentenced to 16 years in prison after he was found guilty of committing sex crimes in Los Angeles County. He has been ordered to serve the sentence on the completion of his 23-year term behind bars from his sexual assault conviction in New York.\nDuring his Golden Globes speech, Gervis stated that \"everyone's watching Netflix\" over movies at theaters. After mocking the Golden Globes broadcast, Gervis advised viewers to switch off and watch his Netflix comedy, Afterlife.\nRemember Hollywood elites' nervous laughter at the Oscars when Ricky Gervais joked about the Epstein list?Now we all know why. This is glorious. pic.twitter.com/eJ4paSo2wV\n\"You can binge watch the entire first season of Afterlife,\" he told the audience. \"That's a show about a man who wants to kill himself after his wife dies of cancer. It has a second season though, so he obviously doesn't kill himself in the end\u2014just like Jeffrey Epstein.\"\nAs laughs and gasps were heard coming from the well-heeled attendees gathered at the Beverly Hilton, Gervais quipped: \"I know he's your friend. But I don't care.\"\nRelentless Podcast host Kyle Becker shared the clip on X, late Wednesday, where as of press time it has garnered more than 6 million views. Becker erroneously labeled Gervais' speech as having taken place at the Oscars.\n\"Remember Hollywood elites' nervous laughter at the Oscars when Ricky Gervais joked about the Epstein list?\" Becker wrote. \"Now we all know why. This is glorious.\"\nThe footage included cutaways to such audience members as Cate Blanchett, who was named in the unsealed documents, and a seemingly shocked Tom Hanks, who for some time has been falsely tied to Epstein on social media.\nIn recent years, a faction of social media users have pushed the theory that several celebrities and public figures\u2014often known to be Democrats\u2014flew to Epstein's private Caribbean island, Little St. James.\nEpstein's private jet, which was used to transport guests to the island, was derisively called the \"Lolita Express\" by certain media...[Content truncated]",

The numbers he garnered on talk show host Shannon Sharpe\u2019s Club Shay Shay has since reached 40 Million in views and 1.2 Million in likes alone. Katt has that \u201cit factor\u201d whatever it is, He\u2019s got it and I\u2019m not just saying that because he\u2019s from the buckeye state like myself, I\u2019m saying it because it\u2019s true. Katt is an incredibly talented man that deserves his flowers while he\u2019s here. But I have to be honest as of late, he\u2019s gotten me distracted with his viral video and don\u2019t get me wrong, I am enjoying Katt exposing the truth on all of his peers in comedy like Cedric the entertainer; Kevin Hart; Rickey Smiley and Steve Harvey to name a few. Only to hear each and every one of them taking to social media to tell Katt to stop being angry and bitter at their success.\u201d Mind you, not one of them refuted Katt\u2019s claims of Kevin allegedly being an industry plant or Cedric stealing Katt\u2019s and comedian Mark Curry\u2019s jokes. To say that entertainment is a cut throat business is putting it lightly.\u201d But I guess all is fair in hate and comedy.\u201d And I especially liked the fact that Katt has taken his pettiness with Kevin Hart to Rapper 50 Cent sized proportions.\u201d By currently teaming up with Kevin Hart\u2019s ex wife, Torrei Hart to go on tour with him and have her open for him. Despite the fact that some backlash started to hit Torrei for supposedly being disloyal to her Ex Kevin. My personal belief on that is that Torrei doesn\u2019t owe anyone an explanation when it comes to business matters. Kevin never once took her out on tour with him when he was married to her and Torrei has been in the comedy world as a writer and standup comic for many years.

The records may include the names of those who worked for Epstein or only had weak ties to the financier as well as potential victims and witnesses. Appearing in the documents does not mean someone is connected to any wrongdoing.\nThe names of those mentioned so far in the documents range from politicians to Hollywood actors, including some of the nation\u2019s most rich and powerful.\nAmong those named in the initial documents include , former President Donald Trump, Michael Jackson, David Copperfield, Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz.\nMany of the names belong to people who had already been publicly connected to Epstein as his long-time associates or friends, including his former lawyer Alan Dershowitz who was mentioned in the documents 137 times. Dershowitz pushed hard for all of the court documents to be released to clear his name.\nIt\u2019s imperative to note the list does not imply that everyone is accused of wrongdoing or illegal and immoral behavior.\nThe documents come from a settled civil lawsuit that Virginia Giuffre, who alleges she was a victim of sex trafficking, filed against\u00a0\nThe Miami Herald has been fighting to unseal documents filed as part of that lawsuit since 2018. The legal battle came to a head in December when ",
