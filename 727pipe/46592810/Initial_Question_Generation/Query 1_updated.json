I think William Barr also worked for that law firm (But apparently wasn't involved with Jeff) at that time. But small world!\nDonald after Jeff's conviction, says he banned Jeff from his properties and cut any contact with him. Jeff however still had Trump's number in his mobile, like 10 years later..\nSo one of the young ladies who had been interfered with by Jeff was unhappy about his light sentence and eventually got some press which caused a relook at our Jeff and ultimately his re arrest.\nDuring the 2000\u2032s Jeff was seen with the likes of Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew. The Prince has a young woman claiming fowl and this has been news for a couple of months. The Prince tried a Trumpesque interview on TV, which got him more trouble. Bill Clinton as far as I know has not had any young women after him. But Donald Trump has a claim of rape by a then under aged girl. she hasn't gotten far against Trump's money and lawyers.\nSo Jeff is arrested and imprisoned in a federal facility in NYC. He is denied bail. Stories emerge that he is suicidal and a few weeks later he is found dead in his cell. His guards are sanctioned for negligence in their round the clock surveillance. Some experts are saying Jeff was murdered. Remarkable silence on this.\nNow when Jeff was arrested the feds tossed his residences and found lots of cash, documents and what were possibly a number of home made dvds, which at the time were thought to be of Jeff's friends engaged with young girls. There were also documents. Was our Jeff blackmailing his friends and ex friends? Did his sudden re arrest after 17 years just a coincidence? Or were powerful people wanting him removed?\nNow AG Bill Barr was in charge of his new indictments and arrest. It was suggested Bill should be recused because of his two former associations with our Jeff. But no, Bill didn't think so.\nAnyway we can all be reassured that Bill Barr will ensure that Jeff's seized materials will be investigated and any evil doers punished\u2026. ,even if Trump is one of them. Not!\nPrince Andrew has been apparently approached by the feds (Jan 2020), so some investigation is happening. And starting in the UK, far away from...[Content truncated]",

While the painting is real, there\u2019s no credible evidence to confirm (or disprove) Epstein owned it.\n*   . In reality, the man is Monte Lipman, the CEO of Republic Records.\n*   . No evidence connected the video to him.\n*   . There were telltale signs of the photo being fake. For instance, the faces of people in the background are deformed and Trump has only one leg.\nThink you\u2019ve come across a fake photo or miscaptioned video involving Epstein?  for potential fact-checking.\nNot all rumors linking Epstein to former presidents are made up. For instance,  showing Trump with two of his children, Ivanka and Eric, alongside Epstein in the \u201890s is real, as well as  that was taken a few years later including Melania Trump and Epstein\u2019s longtime partner, Ghislaine Maxwell.

Visoski said he believed them to be friends as well. \n    \n\nRelated article\nProsecution links Ghislaine Maxwell to Jeffrey Epstein, while defense says she is being blamed for his actions\n\n\n            None of the high profile passengers mentioned in Visoski\u2019s testimony Tuesday are alleged to have committed any wrongdoing in relation to the ongoing trial. Clinton\u2019s spokesman previously admitted to Clinton being aboard Epstein\u2019s plane four times but said the former president knew nothing about Epstein\u2019s \u201cterrible crimes.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cIn 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation,\u201d Clinton spokesman Angel Urena said in 2019. \n    \n\n            Visoski\u2019s testimony came on the second day of Maxwell\u2019s federal trial on charges of conspiracy and sex trafficking. The trial is likely to provide a glimpse into the enigmatic life of Epstein and illuminate some of his connections to high-profile figures like Clinton, Trump, Bill Gates and Prince Andrew.\n    \n\n            Epstein was found dead in his prison cell shortly after his arrest on sex trafficking charges in 2019. The medical examiner later determined the cause of death to be suicide by hanging.\n    \n\n            Maxwell, the British socialite and Epstein\u2019s close confidante, was arrested a year later and has pleaded not guilty to six charges, including conspiracy and sex trafficking.\n    \n\n            In opening statements Monday, prosecutors said Maxwell and Epstein created a \u201cpyramid scheme of abuse\u201d to lure underage girls into sexual relationships with Epstein. Her defense, meanwhile, said she was a \u201cscapegoat\u201d for Epstein\u2019s actions and attacked the memories and motivations of the women who say they were sexually abused.\n    \n\n            Visoski, the prosecution\u2019s first witness, testified Monday and Tuesday about his experiences as Epstein\u2019s pilot beginning in 1991. \n    \n\n            He testified Maxwell frequently traveled on Epstein\u2019s private jet between 1994 and 2004 and would often facilitate travel plans with Visoski for Epstein. Maxwell was Epstein\u2019s \u201cnumber two\u201d and was his \u201cgo-to person to handle everything else that was not business related,\u201d the pilot testified.\n    \n\n            He described his memory of the pair\u2019s relationship as more personal than business-like, but more \u201ccouple-ish\u201d than actually romantic. He didn\u2019t remember seeing them kiss or hold hands, he said.\n    \n\n            Logging the names of all passengers on Epstein\u2019s private flights was not a priority, but they tried their best to be accurate, Visoski said...[Content truncated]",
