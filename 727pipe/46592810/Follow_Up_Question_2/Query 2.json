Viral posts made baseless claims that the tunnel was related to child sex trafficking. But the tunnel apparently resulted from a dispute between two sects over synagogue expansion.\nA long-brewing dispute within a Hasidic Jewish group in Brooklyn boiled over when an unauthorized tunnel adjacent to a synagogue was discovered and ordered stabilized by New York City officials. Videos of the skirmish between some members of the group and city officials that ensued last week went viral on social media and quickly led to conspiracy-laden claims.\nFor example, social media influencer Andrew Tate, who has a history of spreading misinformation, falsely claimed that the tunnel led to a children’s museum. His post on X — which has been viewed more than 11 million times, according to the platform — prompted responses from users such as, “Well they have been involved in pedophilic ritual sacrifice for hundreds of years,” and, “you weren’t supposed to find out about the rape tunnels.”\nOther social media posts had a similar tone, like a post on Instagram that included a video purportedly of the tunnel and asked, “Was this part of an underground pedophile ring?”\n“I wouldn’t be surprised if they dug a tunnel all the way to Episten’s island !” responded one commenter, referring to the accused sex-traff...[Content truncated]",

Yet an Instagram post falsely claims “over 1,000 children are missing.”\nThe wildfires in Maui started on Aug. 8 and burned for days. They consumed more than 2,000 homes and other structures and largely destroyed Lahaina, a historic community that was hit the hardest by the fires. \nFollowing weeks of difficult work using DNA and other methods to confirm and identify the victims of the Maui wildfires, officials announced on Sept. 15 that the death toll was 97, a lower figure than previously reported.\nDr. Jeremy Stuelpnagel, the Maui medical examiner, said at a press conference that day, “because of the fire, because of the heat, because of the situation of this being a mass disaster, many of them are down to the bones — some are fragmented.” Stuelpnagel also said, “We’re trying every single modality we have to make sure that we identify these people. It does take a lot of time. This is a mass disaster.”\nThe county of Maui has released reports on those still unaccounted for following the fires. As of Sept. 15, 31 individuals were reported missing from an initial list of more than 3,200 people. A list identifying the missing was released by the Maui Police Department and the FBI, with one person identified as a minor.\nBut an online video, titled “Over 1,000 Missing Children in Maui,” falsely claims that 1,050 kids are “gone without a trace.” The video goes on to say, “They have absolutely no clue where these children are.”\nThe numbers given in the video may be misleadingly based on the number of children who have not returned to schools or responded to outreach efforts in the Lahaina community of Maui. \nThe wildfires damaged an elementary school beyond repair, and some schools in the Lahaina area remain closed due to environmental concerns, NPR reported.\nThe Hawaii Department of Education released a report on Sept. 7 about the impact of the wildfires on Maui schools and student enrollment. \nDerek Inoshita, a spokesperson for the Education Department provided updated numbers on student enrollment in an email to FactCheck.org on Sep. 15. \nBefore the fire, 3,001 children had been pre-registered in the Lahaina area public schools. Since the fire, 782 students have reenrolled in 44 public schools; 907 have enrolled or been waitlisted in distance learning programs; and about 330 have enrolled in charter or independent schools. \nInoshita said “...[Content truncated]",

Those are the real questions that need to be asked not just about Wayfair but about our broad consumption of cheap goods and services,\" Carr said.\nIn 2017, about 152 million minors globally were engaged in some form of child labor, of which about 73 million were in hazardous labor, . The department also  that includes furniture, clothing apparel and technological appliances.\n**More:**\n\"This is so convoluted,\" Sandy Skelaney, an anti-trafficking expert and adjunct lecturer Florida International University, told USA TODAY. \"It’s, unfortunately, so much easier to traffic somebody than to create an entire furniture catalog around it.\"\nIt is difficult to estimate how prevalent forced labor and child sex-trafficking is in the United States and around the world.
