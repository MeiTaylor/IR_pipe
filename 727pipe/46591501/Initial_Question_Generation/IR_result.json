A Jan. 24, 2024 post on X (formerly Twitter), for example, shared the video with  \"When no one trust no one\":\n!\nThis video was manipulated. The portion appearing to show the two leaders placing their full drinks on the table after toasting is simply a clip of the two picking their glasses up played in reverse. The full  shows the action as it occurred, and it ends with both leaders sipping from their drinks after their toast:\n> \nThis meeting occurred in Russia on April 25, 2019, following a breakdown of talks between former U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim over North Korea's nuclear program, with Putin attempting to serve as a mediator, as  by The Washington Post:\n> Russian President Vladimir Putin emerged from his first summit with Kim Jong Un \\ saying that North Korea needs international security guarantees, not just U.S. pledges, to consider giving up its nuclear arsenal.\n> \n> Putin’s call for more multinational involvement contrasts sharply with President Trump’s strategy of one-on-one dialogue with the North Korean leader. It also reinforced North Korea’s attempt to link security and sanctions relief as twin demands in negotiations over its nuclear program.\nBecause the video was manipulated to suggest a sequence of events that did not happen, the claim is False.\n#### Sources:\nFerris-Rotman, Amie, and Simon Denyer....[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "Does the video show Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin drinking after toasting?",
        "Answer": "The video does not show North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin drinking after toasting. Instead, the video has been manipulated to create the illusion that they placed their drinks down without consuming them. In reality, both leaders toasted and subsequently sipped their drinks. The misleading portion that appears to show them placing their drinks on the table was a clip played in reverse, omitting the actual moment when they drank after toasting [Query 1_evidence_1] [Query 1_evidence_2].",
