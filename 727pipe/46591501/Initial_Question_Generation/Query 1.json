Today, Kim’s hermit kingdom stands tall and proud as Russia’s partner in crime.\nPutin’s engagement with North Korea is as old as his presidency. But the relationship was generally more exotic than practical. Russia’s real partner was , which consistently ranked among its top 10 trade partners, with nearly $30bn in trade volume in 2021. North Korea was never an attractive partner, and it was subject to very restrictive sanctions that Russia, as a permanent member of the UN security council, had helped craft. Until it invaded Ukraine, Russia tried to abide by them in letter and spirit.\nEverything changed with the invasion. In May 2022 – in a development that may foreshadow the beginning of the end for the North Korean sanctions regime – Russia (and China) vetoed a UN security council resolution that would penalise Pyongyang for another round of missile tests.\nIn July 2022, Pyongyang recognised the Russian-occupied puppet republics of Donetsk and Luhansk (just over two months before their annexation by Russia made this recognition moot).

Amid the smiles and camaraderie, a new relationship was being born.’ Photograph: EyePress News/Shutterstock\nThe first – violating the sanctions regime that Russia has helped built up over the years – is probably the least of Putin’s hurdles. Now that Russia itself has become a pariah state, on the receiving end of extensive western sanctions, it is only reasonable that the Kremlin might reach out to fellow rogues. You may argue, of course, that the (partial) dismantling of the sanctions regime will bury all hopes for Pyongyang...[Content truncated]",

Trump left his first meeting with Kim in 2018 saying the pair had a \"special bond.\"\nHowever, Kim's last summit with Trump in February . Negotiations between the two sides have since stalled, and it appears they still disagree about what \"denuclearization\" actually means.\nAnd meeting Putin is partly Kim's way of signaling to Trump that he \"can shop around for a deal,\" according to Robert Kelly, a professor of international relations at South Korea's Pusan University.\n\"Trump, as is his wont, has turned the engagement with Kim into an all-encompassing personal psychodrama, and the U.S. public and media drank that Kool-Aid,\" Kelly said. \"Kim Jong Un is now happy to talk to anyone.\"\nThe North Korean dictator's overriding aim may be to protect his family's dynastic rule against regime change, experts believe.

The two countries share a tiny, 11-mile land border, and Putin wants to build a gas pipeline and rail routes through the North and into South Korea.\nPutin would prefer not to have another nuclear power on his doorstep.
