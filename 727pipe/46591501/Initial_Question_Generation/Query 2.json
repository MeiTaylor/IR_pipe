Putin of Russia during a meeting on Wednesday in Russia.Credit...Vladimir Smirnov/Sputnik\nThey gazed into the workings of a rocket launchpad. They tucked into crab dumplings, sturgeon and entrecôte. And they lifted their glasses at a flower-lined table in the conference room of a remote Russian spaceport, toasting the Kremlin’s “sacred struggle” against a “band of evil,” otherwise known as the West.\nThe summit between President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, which took place Wednesday at the Vostochny Cosmodrome in eastern Russia, signaled a potential new era in relations between Moscow and Pyongyang, as two isolated leaders on wartime footing embraced each other in their moments of need.\nRussia, nearing the 19-month mark in its brutal war of attrition against Ukraine, arrived requiring more ammunition and military equipment for the battlefield, which Pyongyang keeps in abundance. North Korea came looking for food, fuel and cash, according to analysts, in addition to technological help for its missile and satellite programs, and parts for its old, Soviet-era military and civilian aircraft.\nBy the time the two leaders had finished, with Mr. Kim scheduled to continue a rare foreign journey that would take him to aviation factories in Komsomolsk-on-Amur and naval facilities in Vladivostok, it wasn’t clear if any deals had been agreed.\nBut Mr. Putin was sounding optimistic in comments to state news media. He touted cooperation on highways, railways, port infrastructure and agricultural initiatives — and professed that even military cooperation was possible, despite United Nations Security Council sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear program.\n“There are certain restrictions, Russia abides by those restrictions,” Mr. Putin said. “But there are things we of course can talk about. We are discussing and thinking about it. There is also promise here.”\n* * *\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Little was revealed publicly. \n\"As of now, it appears that there have been no substantial developments in the public domain,\" says Fyodor Tertitskiy, a North Korean military researcher at Kookmin University in Seoul.\n\"We observed a two-fold event - a grand spectacle primarily designed for foreign audiences and undisclosed agreements behind closed doors, the significance of which remains uncertain.\"\nNo detail was revealed of the feared arms deal the West is concerned could boost Russia's fight in Ukraine.\nAnd no word was mentioned either of certain gains for North Korea - of food aid, economic help or military and technology sharing, the things that Kim would have wanted say analysts.\nInstead the only known advance appears to be Putin hinting he could potentially help with Kim's space and satellite goals. \nThat's where the choice of venue was noticeable analysts say. Both leaders travelled long distances to get to the space port on the other side of the country from Moscow.\nBut meeting at the site provided significant optics for Putin, analysts say.\nFirst, his offer of space assistance could be argued as being within the acceptable limits of what Russia can give North Korea.\nPyongyang has failed twice this year to get a spy satellite into space - their technology is still decades behind Russia's.\nAnd for Moscow, helping put a satellite in space so the North can watch its enemies is vastly different to the Kremlin aiding a nuclear and missiles programme banned by the UN Security Council.\nBut the problem remains that we don't know what was actually promised to the North.\nPyongyang has nuclear warhead-topped intercontinental ballistic missiles which in theory could reach the US. They currently don't-  because the North in part hasn't worked out how to keep them from frying as they fly through space.\nRussia and the US however know how to protect their missiles- from the same technology they use to protect their satellites. If Moscow has shared this technology with Pyongyang, the US could potentially be in striking distance.\nAs such, the meeting this week at the spaceport is \"equivalent to Putin thumbing his nose at UN Security Council Resolutions\", says Prof Easley. \n\"This should be a wake-up call to all other UN...[Content truncated]",
