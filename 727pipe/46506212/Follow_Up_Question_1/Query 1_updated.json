In the European Alps, winter recreation activities such as ski mountaineering are becoming increasingly popular, which may lead more often to disturbance of Alpine wildlife. Assessment of ski mountaineering activities and related potential conflict zones is needed to implement protection measures and to guide skiers towards nature-friendly behaviour in sensitive locations. Yet basic data regarding frequencies of ski mountaineers is still missing at regional scale. For the Region of the Tyrol (Austria), this study therefore aimed to advance methods of assessing ski mountaineering activities for use in the spatial analysis of conflict zones with grouse species.

The majority of research conducted to date has focused on behavioral effects from individual recreations, thus there is a limited understanding of the potential for population-level or cumulative effects. Brown bears (_Ursus arctos_) are the focus of a growing wildlife viewing industry and are found in habitats frequented by recreationists. Managers face difficult decisions in balancing recreational opportunities with habitat protection for wildlife. Here, we integrate results from empirical studies with expert knowledge to better understand the potential population-level effects of recreational activities on brown bears. We conducted a literature review and Delphi survey of brown bear experts to better understand the frequencies and types of recreations occurring in bear habitats and their potential effects, and to identify management solutions and research needs. We then developed a Bayesian network model that allows managers to estimate the potential effects of recreational management decisions in bear habitats. A higher proportion of individual brown bears in coastal habitats were exposed to recreation, including photography and bear-viewing than bears in interior habitats where camping and hiking were more common. Our results suggest that the primary mechanism by which recreation may impact brown bears is through temporal and spatial displacement with associated increases in energetic costs and declines in nutritional intake. Killings in defense of life and property were found to be minimally associated with recreation in Alaska, but are important considerations in population management. Regulating recreation to occur predictably in space and time and limiting recreation in habitats with concentrated food resources reduces impacts on food intake and may thereby, reduce impacts on reproduction and survival. Our results suggest that decisions managers make about regulating recreational activities in time and space have important consequences for bear populations. The Bayesian network model developed here provides a new tool for managers to balance demands of multiple recreational activities while supporting healthy bear populations.\n**Citation:** Fortin JK, Rode KD, Hilderbrand...[Content truncated]",

Although some research has implied that bears habituate in response to recreational activities, habituation is difficult to measure and it is unknown what proportion of individuals habituate and under what specific conditions it occurs. Habituation may lead to increased opportunities for bear-viewing without displacing bears \\, \\] and decreased bear-human conflicts \\, , , \\]. However, some evidence supports an increased risk of bear-human conflicts in areas where bears are habituated \\, \\].\nIdentification of people\u2019s attitudes towards bears and tolerance levels was also ranked highly as an information need by the Delphi Survey Experts. Understanding the underlying beliefs of human attitudes enables those beliefs to be changed, if necessary, through education and for support to be gained when implementing change \\\\]. People have more positive attitudes with increased knowledge about carnivores \\\\].\nOther priority research objectives relate to studying long-term individual or population level effects of recreational activities because most research to date has evaluated only immediate, individual behavioral responses. Identification of prime bear habitat would also allow for the creation of seasonal, temporal, or zone closures to minimize the impacts on bears.\nControlled studies, such as those that include observations when recreationists are absent, will improve our knowledge of behavioral responses and how they vary by sex and age class and reproductive status. Only a handful of studies have done 24-hr observations to determine what bears are doing when humans are not present \\, \\]. Multi-year studies are important because the availability of food resources varies annually and may be an important interactive factor determining the effect of recreation. It is unknown whether the impacts of multiple recreational activities occurring in the same area are additive, compounding, or compensatory.\nNon-flight energy expenditure, such as increased heart rate, resulting from recreational activities is difficult to measure and, as a result, seldom measured. Although many studies have analyzed the observed reaction distance of bears to varying human activities, the unseen mechanisms of the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response may still lead to an increased energy expenditure for the animal even if they do not exhibit an external reaction \\, \\]. Reynolds et al. \\\\] showed elevated heart rates in grizzly bears in response to aerial surveys. In addition, effects may last for several days after the encounter and have lingering effects on energy expenditure \\\\].\nAbandonment of dens during hibernation is costly, not only in the movement required to find a second den location but also because the subsequent den quality is often poor...[Content truncated]",

SEI staff work with participants in their schools, provide tutoring, encourage academic excellence, and respond to crises in the school.\r\n\r\nIn addition, SEI sponsors field trips, sporting activities, and afterschool supervision. A key component of the program is for staff to work with families and help parents become more active in preventing truancy. In 1994, SEI participants had improved school attendance and disciplinary referrals dropped dramatically.  Students in elementary school raised their grades by 47 percent and middle school students by 70 percent.24\nMentoring\nMentoring has been defined as a \"sustained, close, developmental relationship between an older, more experienced individual and a younger person, with the goal of building character and competence on the part of the prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\"25  Usually the relationship involves regular contact over a sustained period of time and involves mutual commitment, respect, and loyalty.\r\n\r\nMentoring has proved to be a valuable strategy for helping disadvantaged youth. A mentoring relationship can enrich children's lives, address the isolation of some youth from adult contact, and provide support and advocacy for at-risk children. Research has indicated that mentoring relationships can have a positive impact on a youth's attitudes toward alcohol, tobacco, and drug use.26  Other studies document the positive effects of cross-cultural mentoring.27\nBigs in Blue is an innovative mentoring program developed by the Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Warren County, NJ, that matches  at-risk youth with police officer mentors. They employ prevention and intervention strategies to help youngsters from chaotic home environments cope with peer pressure, succeed in school, receive career guidance, and make sound life choices. Evaluations completed by parents, volunteers, and youth indicate reductions in delinquency and court involvement and improvement in school attendance, behavior, and grades.28\nRobert Taylor Homes in Chicago, IL, the largest public housing development in the country, has implemented a Mentoring and Rites of Passage program designed to assist adolescents in their transition to adulthood. Mentors meet with groups of 10 to 15 youths of similar ages at least twice a week and address such areas as self-concept, sexual identity and awareness, communications and decisionmaking, and cultural heritage appreciation.

Generally, they expect AI to continue to be targeted toward efficiencies in workplaces and other activities, and they say it is likely to be embedded in most human endeavors.\nThe greatest share of participants in this canvassing said automated systems driven by artificial intelligence are already improving many dimensions of their work, play and home lives and they expect this to continue over the next decade. While they worry over the accompanying negatives of human-AI advances, they hope for broad changes for the better as networked, intelligent systems are revolutionizing everything, from the most pressing professional work to hundreds of the little \u201ceveryday\u201d aspects of existence.\nOne respondent\u2019s answer covered many of the improvements experts expect as machines sit alongside humans as their assistants and enhancers.

When we have confirmed access, the full article content will load.\nDavid Brooks\nWhat Would You Have Israel Do to Defend Itself?\n-----------------------------------------------\n!\nCredit...Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times\nThere seems to be a broad consensus atop the Democratic Party about the war in Gaza, structured around two propositions. First, after the attacks of Oct. 7, Israel has the right to defend itself and defeat Hamas. Second, the way Israel is doing this is \u201cover the top,\u201d in President Biden\u2019s words. The vast numbers of dead and starving children are gut wrenching, the devastation is overwhelming, and it\u2019s hard not to see it all as indiscriminate.\nWhich leads to an obvious question: If the current Israeli military approach is inhumane, what\u2019s the alternative? Is there a better military strategy Israel can use to defeat Hamas without a civilian blood bath? In recent weeks, I\u2019ve been talking with security and urban warfare experts and others studying Israel\u2019s approach to the conflict and scouring foreign policy and security journals in search of such ideas.\nThe thorniest reality that comes up is that this war is like few others because the crucial theater is underground. Before the war, Israelis estimated Hamas had dug around 100 miles of tunnels. Hamas leaders claimed they had a much more expansive network, and it turns out they were telling the truth. The current Israeli estimates range from 350 to about 500 miles of tunnels. The tunnel network, according to Israel, is where Hamas lives, holds hostages, stores weapons, builds missiles and moves from place to place. By some Israeli estimates, building these tunnels cost the Gazan people about a billion dollars, which could have gone to building schools and starting companies.\nHamas built many of its most important military and strategic facilities under hospitals, schools and so on. Its server farm, for example, was  under the offices of the U.N. relief agency in Gaza City, according to the Israeli military.\nDaphne Richemond-Barak, the author of \u201cUnderground Warfare,\u201d  in Foreign Policy magazine: \u201cNever in the history of tunnel warfare has a defender been able to spend months in such confined spaces. The digging itself, the innovative ways Hamas has made use of the tunnels and the group\u2019s survival...[Content truncated]",

Stinson also expressed concerns for sage -grouse disturbance on WDFW lands when \nand where horseback riding, wilderness navigation courses, trail runs, and dog trials overlap with \nbreeding and nesting season (D. Stinson, WD FW, personal communication). \nIt is unknown whether snowmobile activity overlaps with Washington sage -grouse habitat. \nBecause most Douglas County sage -grouse populations are on private land, it is possible that \nsnowmobile activity on these lands disturb gr ouse, although Stinson suspects that disturbance is \nlimited (D. Stinson, WDFW, personal communication). There are no designated groomed routes \nin the Douglas County SMUs but in general, snowmobile use is allowed both on and off trail on \nDNR land, with the only significant parcel open to snowmobiles located along State Route 174, \nwest of Grand Coulee. No public lands appear to have designated ski or snowshoeing areas, \nthough all public land in Washington sage -grouse range is open to non -motorized recreation. \nThe YTC is open to public, non -motorized recreation when not in conflict with military training. \nThe YTC enacts sage -grouse protection measures during the breeding season from February 1st \u2013\n15th of June, closing areas designated as Sage -grouse Protection A reas.
