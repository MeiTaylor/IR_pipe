Medical personnel, as civilians, also suffer directly and can be forced to leave their jobs and flee.\n#### Run for your life\nAs neighbourhoods become front lines, the basics of life – water, food, health care, jobs, education and decent accommodation – suddenly become hard to find. People are often forced to flee their homes, overturning their lives and exposing themselves to greater risks, such as sexual and gender-based violence, as they lose their livelihoods and support networks.

Similarly, the security situation and school closures mean that children may be unable to go to school for years, impeding an entire generation in their quest for a better life.\nThe humanitarian consequences of urban warfare are complex, direct and indirect, immediate and long-term, visible and invisible.

Negotiations must allow for the disentanglement of civilians and fighters.\nThe utmost care is needed during evacuations of people from cities under siege. In urban environments there can be a multiplicity of groups controlling different territories; the frontlines change and multiply, all of which increases difficulty of contact, security guarantees and access.\nLast December, the ICRC working with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, in its role as a neutral intermediary evacuated 35,000 people from devastated Eastern Aleppo to rural neighborhoods. The streets of Aleppo have been devastated by violence, with families struggling for months to find safety, food, medical care or shelter. With temperatures below freezing, people were burning whatever they could find, including blankets and clothes, to keep themselves and their children warm. More than 100 SARC volunteers and ICRC staff remained by their side day and night over the week to ensure their safety and try to provide some guidance and reassurance.\nIn particular this huge operation required careful negotiations with the different parties on the ground. Negotiations were held over a week and stalled several times until solid guarantees were given to ensure civilians would be protected and provided a safe passage.\n**The impact of protracted fighting on people's lives**\nSo you can see the complexity of today's conflicts. People who survive urban warfare have no choice but to adapt to extraordinary circumstances, whether they stay in their home cities or decide to flee. But they urgently need better protection and support. The mental, emotional and physical impact of urban warfare on people requires greater attention to work out how best to alleviate and prevent this suffering.\nThe invisible scars that people are left with are can not be underestimated. Wars affect people in very deep and profound ways. While it is difficult to predict the long term impact of those who live in warzones, for example the children of Mosul, it is likely to have severe effects which we should not overlook.\nJust a month ago I was in Eastern Ukraine, the second time I have visited since fighting broke out almost three years ago.\nThe armed conflict in the Donbass is taking place in a highly populated areas. The vital infrastructure which hundreds of thousands of people depend on for their survival are on the frontline of the fighting. Donetsk, once an industrial hub and one of the largest cities in Ukraine, has seen heavy shelling, civilian fatalities and homes destroyed.\nWhat I saw there was a weariness of the people who have lived now for so long in fear,...[Content truncated]",

The concentration of people has its own demographic characteristics: population density, neighborhoods and their make-up, ethnicity, race, age, daily movement in and around the city, and other considerations based on the nature and behavior of the populace. Other sociocultural characteristics may include religion, political leanings and activity, economics, clan or tribal affiliation, criminal organizations and activities, and class divisions. The population in an urban environment must be considered as a distinct and critical aspect of the commander’s assessment. The human dimension is the very essence of the urban environment. Understanding local cultural, political, social, economic, and religious factors is crucial to successful JUOs and becomes central to mission success. (2) It is important to understand that urban populations are extremely heterogeneous. The overall population is composed of several groups, each with its own Chapter II II-6 JP 3-06 interests. Relationships between groups might be congenial, hostile, or dependent. Understanding this diversity and complexity requires a significant amount of mental effort and flexibility. (a) The cultural tendencies of urban residents might be very different from what friendly forces are accustomed to. Food, habits, living conditions, laws, religious customs, and beliefs may initially distance a warfighter from the city’s residents. The differences must be appreciated by the friendly force in order to achieve and maintain legitimacy within a foreign operational area. (b) Cultural differences can also affect tactical efforts. In Mogadishu, for instance, groups of civilians protected Somali gunmen by using their own bodies as cover. This unfamiliar tactic created a dilemma for soldiers constrained by the ROE and the law of war. It is important to recognize, however, that not all sectors of the population, including those that at first glance may appear threatening, necessarily work against the friendly force. Individuals and groups of all backgrounds can be co-opted or influenced by the friendly force to serve a friendly or benign objective. (c) The abundant population groups and subgroups inherent to cities make threat identification difficult. Unlike more traditional operations on open terrain, where merely spotting an unknown entity would assist in deciphering friend from foe, urban areas are packed with individuals and groups that might have the capabilities, interests, or intentions that can threaten a unit’s mission. An analyst may not be able to distinguish urban friend from foe just by simple observation. Knowing what groups exist within the operational area and understanding the interests and intentions of each can help in planning operations that, per the commander’s intent, exploit all capabilities and opportunities to accomplish military objectives and support other agencies or organizations in attaining the desired end state. d.

But, if the world fails to  of reducing carbon emissions and limit global average temperature rise to 1.5oC, many of the world’s cities will face an extraordinary threat from rising seas and coastal flooding by mid-century. According to the new The Future We Don’t Want analysis, the total urban population at risk from sea level rise, if emissions don’t go down, could number over 800 million people, living in 570 cities, by 2050. It is therefore crucial that  are honoured if the social and economic impacts of catastrophic climate change are to be avoided.\nEstimates suggest that the global economic costs to cities, from rising seas and inland flooding, could amount to $1 trillion by mid-century. As with other climate hazards, local factors mean that cities will experience sea level rise at different paces. Cities on the east coast of the U.S., including New York City and Miami, are particularly vulnerable, along with major cities in South East Asia, such as Bangkok and Shanghai. In the U.S., east coast cities are witnessing sea level rise that is two to three times faster than the global average while cities along China’s Yellow River Delta are experiencing sea level rise of more than...[Content truncated]",

Stephen Townsend, in his review of the _National Defense Strategy_, highlights the importance of winning the competition before and after conflict.10 All of these examples emphasize the importance of adopting an expanded view of conflict, one that includes various domains and scales which are constantly evolving as a result of actions on all sides of a conflict or operation.\nDense urban areas represent one of the most complex operational environments due to the coalescence of various domains and scales. Here, the contest to control scale and domain plays out in a relatively small region, with a very dense and complex population. It is in dense urban areas where the challenges of MDO reach their zenith and where complexity is fluid and rapid, both in a spatial and temporal sense.\n### The Wicked Complex Environment of Dense Urban Areas\nToday, the majority of the world’s population live in cities. Most of the key elements of societies including economic, social, political, and cultural structures are more focused on urban areas than in any other period of history. Therefore, as we study places, it is essential to understand the key cities of the region.\nWhat makes dense urban spaces complex? The size, density, and social elements of a city create a complex and changing environment. Cities are continuously changing and are influenced by human activities as humans strive to understand and influence activities within them. The city is a dense and diverse settlement with a dynamic population. While certain characteristics exist in many cities, the way these characteristics influence specific cities is unique. Dense urban areas are also highly interconnected internally and to the rest of the world. All this complexity creates a challenging set of problems for an urban analyst to consider. First, what are the critical factors that influence the evolution of cities? Once these factors are identified and defined, how do analysts measure and model those factors? Finally, how do the factors interact to create a series of systems that influence how a city functions?\nTo identify the important factors to consider when operating in a dense urban area, a conceptual model is needed to organize analysis. Richard Wolfel, Amy Richmond, and Peter Grazaitis adopted Leonard Binder’s model of political development to conceptualize functions in a city.11 Binder identifies five categories of political development, and Joseph LaPalombara and William Fierman later added allocation.12 While many other networks are also important to dense urban regions...[Content truncated]",

Careful consideration of these five factors can minimize the cost of urban warfare to the attacker. \nAttacker cost was generally high in casualties, time, and resources in the majority of urban battles studied. \nFrom the standpoint of the defender, the critical variable is the defensive preparation of the city. Defensive preparations should include measures to prevent isolation of the city by the attackers. The capture of a prepared city can be made to be extremely costly. Preparations can include creating kill zones, clearing fields of fire, constructing canalizing obstacles, establishing reinforcing and fall-back positions, decentralizing command and control, and organizing multiple movement routes above ground, between rooftops, and below ground in subways and sewers. Artillery and aviation support can also be valuable force multipliers in defense. \ni. Rules of Engagement (ROE). The nature of the military operation may restrict our use of weapons. The majority of urban battles since 1967 (such as Beirut II , Hue , Jerusalem ) have had one or more of the following restrictions imposed on the attacking force: \n(1) Minimizing civilian casualties and/or collateral destruction in order to: Avoiding alienation of the local population Reducing the risk of adverse world or domestic opinion Preserving facilities for future use Preserving cultural facilities and grounds. \n(2) Limiting the use of specific ground or air weapons. \nj. Logistics. Timely combat service support, particularly in the areas of ammunition resupply and casualty treatment and evacuation, is a critical element in MOUT.  \n> ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nMCWP 3-35.3 \n1-18 (1) Logistics Support. Historically, combat in urban environments has seen a dramatic increase in the amounts of Class IV (shoring, sandbags, concertina wire), Class V (ammunition), and Class VIII (medical material). Unique items, such as rope, grappling hooks, and ladders are required for operations on urbanized terrain. Intense close-quarter combat requires a continuous flow of ammunition, particularly small-arms, tank, antitank, mortar, and artillery ammunition, as well as mines, grenades, and demolition explosives. Medical supplies must be readily available to treat the anticipated increase in casualties. Once battle the has been initiated, combat forces will require continuous supply. \nUrban warfare requires a flexible, balanced logistics system capable of sustaining the close-quarter fighting evolutions within the built-up area. \nOne method of providing continuous logistics support is to establish a “push system.” Essentially, this...[Content truncated]",

The collapse into inter-ethnic conflict of once relatively harmonious multicultural cities like pre-World War I Vienna, pre-World War II Warsaw, and in more recent decades Beirut, Sarajevo, and Srebrenica, highlights the fragility of cultural diversity. Learning to live with cultural diversity, managing cultural exchanges among people, organizations, and institutions, and dealing directly with inequities and discrimination are challenges that cities must face if they are to be socially inclusive and culturally diverse.\nFor most cities, efforts to decrease social polarization and manage diversity rely on the \"bedrock\" social policies of public education, health care, and income support that are usually the responsibility of national and state, provincial or regional governments. But social inclusion also depends on the quality of the countless interactions that occur among the kaleidoscope of individuals, social groups, and institutions that exist in a city. In this respect, city governments also have a responsibility to develop local policies that manage diversity and integrate newcomers and long-established residents into dynamic social, economic, and political environments. They also must take the lead in mitigating practices of exclusion and segregation that are so acutely felt in the places where people live. Social inclusion in urban places does not just happen organically.\n**Management and Integration Programs**\nManaging diversity and creating the conditions for social inclusion can no longer be a concern for old central cities alone. In many cities the majority of immigrants, both new and long-established, settle in the suburbs, not the traditional inner-city enclaves that so dominate our imagined ethnic landscapes. In the United States, this trend could be observed in some large immigrant gateway cities during the 1980s, but in the past decade suburban neighborhoods have emerged as new multiethnic immigrant enclaves in both new and established settlement gateways.\n<table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Inclusive Urban Environments Rely on:</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><div><ul><li><span><span>Street design</span></span></li><li><span><span>Pricing and availability of public transportation</span></span></li><li><span><span>Location and accessibility of employment</span></span></li><li><span><span>Management of schools</span></span></li><li><span><span>Management of police services</span></span></li><li><span...[Content truncated]",
