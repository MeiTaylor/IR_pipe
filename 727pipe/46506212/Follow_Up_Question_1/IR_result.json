First, after the attacks of Oct. 7, Israel has the right to defend itself and defeat Hamas. Second, the way Israel is doing this is “over the top,” in President Biden’s words. The vast numbers of dead and starving children are gut wrenching, the devastation is overwhelming, and it’s hard not to see it all as indiscriminate.\nWhich leads to an obvious question: If the current Israeli military approach is inhumane, what’s the alternative? Is there a better military strategy Israel can use to defeat Hamas without a civilian blood bath? In recent weeks, I’ve been talking with security and urban warfare experts and others studying Israel’s approach to the conflict and scouring foreign policy and security journals in search of such ideas.\nThe thorniest reality that comes up is that this war is like few others because the crucial theater is underground. Before the war, Israelis estimated Hamas had dug around 100 miles of tunnels. Hamas leaders claimed they had a much more expansive network, and it turns out they were telling the truth. The current Israeli estimates range from 350 to about 500 miles of tunnels. The tunnel network, according to Israel, is where Hamas lives, holds hostages, stores weapons, builds missiles and moves from place to place. By some Israeli estimates, building these tunnels cost the Gazan people about a billion dollars, which could have gone to building schools and starting companies.\nHamas built many of its most important military and strategic facilities under hospitals, schools and so on. Its server farm, for example, was  under the offices of the U.N. relief agency in Gaza City, according to the Israeli military.\nDaphne Richemond-Barak, the author of “Underground Warfare,”  in Foreign Policy magazine: “Never in the history of tunnel warfare has a defender been able to spend months in such confined spaces. The digging itself, the innovative ways Hamas has made use of the tunnels and the group’s survival...[Content truncated]",

The majority of research conducted to date has focused on behavioral effects from individual recreations, thus there is a limited understanding of the potential for population-level or cumulative effects. Brown bears (_Ursus arctos_) are the focus of a growing wildlife viewing industry and are found in habitats frequented by recreationists. Managers face difficult decisions in balancing recreational opportunities with habitat protection for wildlife. Here, we integrate results from empirical studies with expert knowledge to better understand the potential population-level effects of recreational activities on brown bears. We conducted a literature review and Delphi survey of brown bear experts to better understand the frequencies and types of recreations occurring in bear habitats and their potential effects, and to identify management solutions and research needs. We then developed a Bayesian network model that allows managers to estimate the potential effects of recreational management decisions in bear habitats. A higher proportion of individual brown bears in coastal habitats were exposed to recreation, including photography and bear-viewing than bears in interior habitats where camping and hiking were more common. Our results suggest that the primary mechanism by which recreation may impact brown bears is through temporal and spatial displacement with associated increases in energetic costs and declines in nutritional intake. Killings in defense of life and property were found to be minimally associated with recreation in Alaska, but are important considerations in population management. Regulating recreation to occur predictably in space and time and limiting recreation in habitats with concentrated food resources reduces impacts on food intake and may thereby, reduce impacts on reproduction and survival. Our results suggest that decisions managers make about regulating recreational activities in time and space have important consequences for bear populations. The Bayesian network model developed here provides a new tool for managers to balance demands of multiple recreational activities while supporting healthy bear populations.\n**Citation:** Fortin JK, Rode KD, Hilderbrand...[Content truncated]",

Negotiations must allow for the disentanglement of civilians and fighters.\nThe utmost care is needed during evacuations of people from cities under siege. In urban environments there can be a multiplicity of groups controlling different territories; the frontlines change and multiply, all of which increases difficulty of contact, security guarantees and access.\nLast December, the ICRC working with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, in its role as a neutral intermediary evacuated 35,000 people from devastated Eastern Aleppo to rural neighborhoods. The streets of Aleppo have been devastated by violence, with families struggling for months to find safety, food, medical care or shelter. With temperatures below freezing, people were burning whatever they could find, including blankets and clothes, to keep themselves and their children warm. More than 100 SARC volunteers and ICRC staff remained by their side day and night over the week to ensure their safety and try to provide some guidance and reassurance.\nIn particular this huge operation required careful negotiations with the different parties on the ground. Negotiations were held over a week and stalled several times until solid guarantees were given to ensure civilians would be protected and provided a safe passage.\n**The impact of protracted fighting on people's lives**\nSo you can see the complexity of today's conflicts. People who survive urban warfare have no choice but to adapt to extraordinary circumstances, whether they stay in their home cities or decide to flee. But they urgently need better protection and support. The mental, emotional and physical impact of urban warfare on people requires greater attention to work out how best to alleviate and prevent this suffering.\nThe invisible scars that people are left with are can not be underestimated. Wars affect people in very deep and profound ways. While it is difficult to predict the long term impact of those who live in warzones, for example the children of Mosul, it is likely to have severe effects which we should not overlook.\nJust a month ago I was in Eastern Ukraine, the second time I have visited since fighting broke out almost three years ago.\nThe armed conflict in the Donbass is taking place in a highly populated areas. The vital infrastructure which hundreds of thousands of people depend on for their survival are on the frontline of the fighting. Donetsk, once an industrial hub and one of the largest cities in Ukraine, has seen heavy shelling, civilian fatalities and homes destroyed.\nWhat I saw there was a weariness of the people who have lived now for so long in fear,...[Content truncated]",

In urban environments there can be a multiplicity of groups controlling different territories; the frontlines change and multiply, all of which increases difficulty of contact, security guarantees and access.\nLast December, the ICRC working with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, in its role as a neutral intermediary evacuated 35,000 people from devastated Eastern Aleppo to rural neighborhoods. The streets of Aleppo have been devastated by violence, with families struggling for months to find safety, food, medical care or shelter. With temperatures below freezing, people were burning whatever they could find, including blankets and clothes, to keep themselves and their children warm. More than 100 SARC volunteers and ICRC staff remained by their side day and night over the week to ensure their safety and try to provide some guidance and reassurance.\nIn particular this huge operation required careful negotiations with the different parties on the ground. Negotiations were held over a week and stalled several times until solid guarantees were given to ensure civilians would be protected and provided a safe passage.\n**The impact of protracted fighting on people's lives**\nSo you can see the complexity of today's conflicts. People who survive urban warfare have no choice but to adapt to extraordinary circumstances, whether they stay in their home cities or decide to flee. But they urgently need better protection and support. The mental, emotional and physical impact of urban warfare on people requires greater attention to work out how best to alleviate and prevent this suffering.\nThe invisible scars that people are left with are can not be underestimated. Wars affect people in very deep and profound ways. While it is difficult to predict the long term impact of those who live in warzones, for example the children of Mosul, it is likely to have severe effects which we should not overlook.\nJust a month ago I was in Eastern Ukraine, the second time I have visited since fighting broke out almost three years ago.\nThe armed conflict in the Donbass is taking place in a highly populated areas. The vital infrastructure which hundreds of thousands of people depend on for their survival are on the frontline of the fighting. Donetsk, once an industrial hub and one of the largest cities in Ukraine, has seen heavy shelling, civilian fatalities and homes destroyed.\nWhat I saw there was a weariness of the people who have lived now for so long in fear,...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "How do experts interpret the implications of leisure activities in conflict zones like Kyiv during the war?",
        "Answer": "Experts interpret the implications of leisure activities in conflict zones like Kyiv during the war in several nuanced ways:\n\n1. **Resilience and Normalcy**: Many experts argue that the continuation of leisure activities, such as social gatherings and outings, reflects the resilience of the local population. Activities like visiting beach clubs or participating in parties can be seen as manifestations of the human spirit to maintain a semblance of normal life amidst chaos. This perspective aligns with the assertion that signs of social engagement do not negate the reality of war; rather, they exemplify how individuals adapt and persist in the face of adversity. Such resilience serves as a form of defiance against the horrors of war, indicating that life continues despite the hardships.\n\n2. **Psychological Coping Mechanism**: Engaging in leisure activities can also serve as a psychological coping mechanism for individuals living in conflict zones. The need to escape from the continuous stress of warfare leads people to seek moments of joy and normalcy. However, experts caution that this does not diminish the serious impacts of the conflict on daily life, including trauma, loss, and instability. Thus, these activities may provide temporary relief but do not alter the underlying realities of urban warfare.\n\n3. **Misinterpretations Among Observers**: There is concern that external observers may misinterpret the presence of leisure activities as signs that the war is less severe or even fabricated. Such interpretations can detract from understanding the genuine suffering and challenges faced by those living in conflict zones. Experts argue that enjoying leisure activities amid war is complex and should not lead to dismissing the realities of violence and instability.\n\nIn conclusion, while leisure activities in conflict zones might appear as signs of normalcy, they must be understood as complex manifestations of resilience, coping, and socio-cultural adaptation amidst ongoing challenges. Consequently, experts believe that these activities should not be misconstrued as evidence that the conflict is exaggerated or false.",
