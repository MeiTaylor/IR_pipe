Battle losses in the east and a third winter of relentless Russian attacks on the power grid have worn the Ukrainian people down. Yet they somehow maintain their decency.\nAt the volunteer kitchen, my aggressive...[Content truncated]",

Comparably, that figure was only 9 percent a month into the war and 7 percent in May 2022.\nIt has also become a Republican talking point both for 2024 hopefuls and congressional lawmakers who are refusing to pass the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) if it includes more money for Ukraine.\nBeach club in Kyiv during the war. #kyiv #beachclub #ukraine #kyivparty #sundayparty #hotweather #summerparty #bikiny #ukrainiang...[Content truncated]",

Vance and emblazoned with Vance\u2019s immortal words, \u201cI don\u2019t really care what happens to Ukraine.\u201d Or one signed by House Speaker Mike Johnson, big enough to sum up his worldview: I was for Ukraine aid until I was against it, but I could be for it again if Trump is not against it. This is a matter of principle for me. Either way, it\u2019s all Biden\u2019s fault.\nAnd then the ultimate collector\u2019s item. For an extra $1,000, a giant white surrender flag, made from the softest Sea Island cotton, signed by Lindsey Graham, that says: \u201cI gave up the principles of John McCain and a free Ukraine because Trump told me to. But I got a round of golf at Trump\u2019s West Palm Beach course. Can I still be on \u2018Meet the Press\u2019?\u201d\nThe last gift comes with a pair of Trump\u2019s new branded tennis shoes, guaranteed by Trump and personally tested by Graham, to be the fastest shoe on the market to run away from any ally or foe \u2014 or anything principled that you\u2019ve ever said.\nThe possibilities are endless, because Trump\u2019s G.O.P. has become bottomless. It now manifests an infinite willingness to engage in any form of crow eating, bootlicking, backtracking and backstabbing to stay in his good graces, no matter how crackpot, selfish or un-American his demand. Trump decides to just dump Ukraine? Bye-bye, Zelensky. Trump decides to toss aside months of bipartisan work to forge a grand bargain on immigration reform? Gone \u2014 no questions asked!\nI\u2019ve never seen so many people in one party behave with so little respect for themselves or the nation\u2019s interests at one time.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

CBS News/Agnes Reau\n\"It can be scary sometimes to be honest,\" George admitted to us outside a caf\u00e9 in the city, which still regularly hears the loud booms of incoming and outgoing rockets. \"But now, you know, it's summer, and we are students. We are all 20 years old, and we are trying to enjoy our lives\u2026 Sometimes it really can be tough, because we live really close to the Russian border.\"\n*   \nDespite the missiles, Ukraine's nightlife is rocking. Bars and clubs are full. We visited one and found the place jumping, with music pumping, drinks flowing freely and young Ukrainians dancing like there's no tomorrow.\nHere's a fun fact: There are now more bars and restaurants open in the capital city of Kyiv than there were before the start of Russia's full-scale invasion more than 17 months ago.\n!\nPeople inspect a building in Kharkiv, eastern Ukraine, that housed apartments and the popular Hemingway Bar before it was hit by a missile in the early days of Russia's full-scale invasion, in mid-July, 2023. CBS News/Agnes Reau\nPerhaps it's an act of defiance.\nIt certainly is when they have to quite literally pick up the pieces and figure out how, or if, to carry on.\nThat was the stark choice for the people who worked and relaxed at the Hemingway Bar. There isn't much left of the building that previously housed apartments and the bar, which had been turned into a bomb shelter. It took a direct hit in the early days of the war, killing and wounding those inside.\nGrim irony for a bar named after the legendary war author Earnest Hemingway.\nUndeterred, the people behind the bar reopened it just a few blocks away as soon as they could.\n\"I had mixed feelings,\" owner Konstantin Kuts told CBS News. \"Because I lost my business, but I did not lose my life. People died, and I am alive, and that means I can carry on and do something.\"\n\"Life always defeats death,\" he said, adding a quote from his bar's namesake: \"The sun...[Content truncated]",
