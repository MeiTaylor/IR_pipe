New draft legislation on civil partnerships included same-sex relationships. The war continued to have a devastating impact on economic and social rights, particularly of children and older people, as well as on the environment. Serious human rights violations continued in Russian occupied territories.\n### Background\nRussia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine continued, resulting in civilian deaths, destruction of infrastructure, and consistently high levels of internally displaced people and refugees. As of November, the UN had recorded 28,711 civilian casualties since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022, including 10,058 deaths. A Ukrainian counteroffensive made minimal territorial gains, opening the prospect of a prolonged war of attrition and raising concerns about sustainability of military support from Ukraine\u2019s allies. The economy continued to significantly contract, with a growing dependency on foreign grants and loans. In July Russia withdrew from the Black Sea Grain Initiative intended to ensure stable food prices and avert the threat of famine in lower-income countries.\nOn 14 December, the European Council decided to open EU accession negotiations with Ukraine.\nViolations of international humanitarian law\n--------------------------------------------\nRussian forces continued indiscrim...[Content truncated]",

It starts from the status quo of Ukraine\u2019s banking and capital market and suggests policy options for improving effectiveness and increasing international trust in the system.\n**European Union Institute for Security Studies**  \nThe publication notes that Ukraine urgently needs investment in local production capacities and repair and maintenance facilities. The EU and Ukraine have a shared strategic interest in supporting the reform and development of Ukraine\u2019s rapidly expanding defence industry.\n**Vox Ukraine**  \nThe paper addresses the digital dimension of violence, reviews the latest data globally and in the EU, and how this problem is being addressed in Europe and more specifically in Ukraine. However, it seems impossible to conduct an objective and comprehensive analysis of the problem of violence (including gender-based violence) in the digital dimension in Ukraine. So, the paper makes some on what Ukraine needs to do.\n**Polski Instytut Spraw Mi\u0119dzynarodowych (Polish Institute of International Affairs)**  \nThis report explores the attempts to redefine regional political cooperation in many Central European states. While signaling the prospects for common actions, the report also aims to contribute to the debate on the directions of the future development of this cooperation.\n**Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation**  \nThe EU\u2019s European Peace Facility (EPF) has incentivized its member states to give military equipment to Ukraine by reimbursing them for some of the costs. However, there is now little left to give as most of the old equipment has been divested. As such, European military support to Kyiv is lagging. The problem, as the brief argues, is that there is a tension between rebuilding European militaries and supporting Ukraine. A new paradigm is urgently needed for Europe\u2019s military support for Ukraine.\n**Carnegie Europe**\u00a0  \nAccording to the brief, political shifts in Europe and the US risk deepening divisions within the EU. Leaders should make clear that investing in Ukraine\u2019s defence is essential for securing Europe\u2019s shared future.\n**The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies**  \nThis note contributes to the debate on Dutch support.

Every so often, video footage of Ukrainians engaged in everyday activities appears on social media accompanied by suggestions that the situation in Ukraine cannot be as serious as claimed if it is still possible to visit restaurants, attend pool parties, or stroll in the park.\nThese cynical assertions completely miss the point. Signs of normality in today\u2019s Ukraine are not proof that the war is somehow exaggerated or fake; they are evidence of the courage and resilience that are helping Ukrainians to handle the horror of Europe\u2019s biggest conflict since World War II.\nEver since the Russian attack began in February 2022, Ukrainian resilience has been one of the defining features of the war. When Vladimir Putin took the decision to launch his invasion, he seems to have genuinely believed that any armed resistance would quickly melt away and fully expected the Ukrainian state to collapse within a couple of days. Instead, the Ukrainian military fought back with great skill and bravery, inflicting punishing losses on the Russian invaders and winning the admiration of the watching world. \nBeyond the battlefield, Ukraine\u2019s state structures have also proven surprisingly durable. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy set the tone during the initial hours of the war by declaring his intention to remain in the Ukrainian capital. Elected officials across the country soon followed suit, with parliament regularly convening in Kyiv and municipal authorities heavily involved in security and humanitarian responses to the Russian invasion.\nThe wartime performance of Ukraine\u2019s public sector has been equally impressive. Despite the constant threat of Russian bombardment, Ukrainian trains have continued to run on time, playing a key role in the evacuation of the civilian population and serving as a lifeline for the blockaded Ukrainian economy. The Ukrainian postal service has often been among the first organizations to resume operations in newly liberated regions...[Content truncated]",

For example, U.S. and allied long-range, highly accurate, multiple-launch rocket systems provided to Ukraine in summer 2022 caused major disruptions to Russian military logistics and resupply.\nGreater clarity about the future of U.S. and allied military assistance could be used for two purposes. First, if a clear, long-term plan were adopted with credible delivery schedules and clear capability implications, it could make Russia more pessimistic about the future of its own campaign. The United States has already taken steps in this direction with the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative and the establishment of a component of U.S. European Command dedicated to the Ukraine assistance effort. But arms deliveries have not yet become regular, nor is there a transparent long-term plan. Western assistance continues to be calibrated in response to Russian actions, and thus Ukraine's future capabilities are uncertain. Transparent long-term plans with strong domestic and international backing could minimize the unpredictability, though they may also be less responsive to a changing threat environment.]\nSecond, the United States could decide to condition future military aid on a Ukrainian commitment to negotiations. Setting conditions on aid to Ukraine would address a primary source of Kyiv's optimism that may be prolonging the war: a belief that Western aid will continue indefinitely or grow in quality and quantity. At the same time, the United States could also promise more aid for the postwar period to address Ukraine's fears about the durability of peace. Washington has done so in other cases, providing vast amounts of aid to Israel after it signed the Camp David accords and a bilateral peace treaty with Egypt, ensuring that Israel's capabilities exceeded those of its neighbors. Although this example differs in important ways from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, it suggests that the United States does have ways to calibrate long-term aid commitments to reassure close partners about their ability to defend themselves. Doing so in this case while also signaling the limits of wartime assistance could address Ukraine's short-term optimism about continuing the war while increasing its confidence in the longevity of any arrangements to end the fighting.\nLinking aid to Ukrainian willingness to negotiate has been anathema in Western policy discussions and for good reason: Ukraine is defending itself against unprovoked Russian aggression. However, the U.S. calculus may change as the costs and risks of the war mount.] And the use of this U.S. lever can be calibrated. For example, the United States could level off aid, not dramatically reduce it, if Ukraine does not negotiate. And, again, a decision to level off wartime support pending negotiations can be made in tandem with promises about postwar _sustained increases_ in assistance over the long term...[Content truncated]",

It was aimed, first and foremost, at drawing a distinction between the actions of the Kremlin and the attitudes of ordinary Russians. There was optimism that ordinary Russians would not countenance a war against a neighboring country.2 But hopes of Russian grassroots opposition to the war were swiftly dashed. Indeed, public opinion polls have consistently shown overwhelming support (70 percent or higher) for what Moscow calls its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine. Contrary to expectations, Putin\u2019s popularity has also seen a boost, similar to what happened in the immediate wake of the 2014 annexation of Crimea.\nPartly in response to these indicators, figures like Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have called for a visa ban for all Russian passport holders, with an exception for people whose safety is at risk or who are vulnerable to political persecution.3 According to Zelenskyy, \u201c[T]he most important sanctions are to close the borders\u2014because the Russians are taking away someone else\u2019s land\u201d and Russians should \u201clive in their own world until they change their philosophy.\u201d He added, \u201cThe population picked this government and they\u2019re not fighting it, not arguing with it, not shouting at it.\u201d Such sentiments are echoed in calls by some European politicians, such as Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin, for an EU ban on tourist visas. \u201cIt\u2019s not right that at the same time as Russia is waging an aggressive, brutal war of aggression in Europe, Russians can live a normal life, travel in Europe, be tourists. It\u2019s not right,\u201d Marin said in mid-August.4\nAt the same time, a careful reading of popular Russian attitudes toward the war reveals important nuances that all too often are overlooked. First and foremost is the fact that rather than consolidating Russian society, the conflict has exacerbated existing divisions on a diverse array of issues, including support for the regime. Put another way, the impression that Putin now has the full support of the Russian public is simply incorrect. A more careful reading of sociological data, including conversations with focus group participants and quantitative research, presents a far more complex picture of Russian society.\nNote: This paper is based on sociological research and opinion polling carried out across Russia by the Levada Center from February to August 2022, as well as on the findings of eight Levada-convened focus groups that were held from March to May 2022 in Moscow and in three regional centers.\nThe general picture of public opinion in Russia can be understood in rather simple terms. All across Russia since February 24, old friends have fallen out; parents and children are no longer on speaking terms; long...[Content truncated]",
