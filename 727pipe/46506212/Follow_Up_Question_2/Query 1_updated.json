Times, the Boston Globe, and The Washington Post, signed an open letter condemning Israel\u2019s killing of reporters in Gaza and criticizing the war coverage in Western media. The signatories argue for the use of precise terms like \"apartheid\" and \"ethnic cleansing\" to describe Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians, pointing out the double standards in reporting.\nInternational media outlets tend to provide a more diverse range of perspectives, often highlighting the humanitarian impacts on Palestinian civilians. These outlets are generally more direct in critiquing Israeli policies and actions, and they demonstrate a greater willingness to use terms that US media might shy away from. The BBC, for example, has been harshly criticized for a perceived anti-Israeli bias, including referring to Hamas as \u201cmilitants,\u201d as opposed to terrorists, and interviewing guests who praised the Hamas attack. This broader and sometimes more critical vocabulary in international coverage reflects a less conservative approach to the conflict than in American media.\nSome US media outlets have been  for their coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. How does the media\u2019s choice of what stories to cover in conflict and what photos/videos to show in their coverage impact public perception?\nThrough their framing, selection of stories, and use of visual media, news outlets have immense power to influence public opinion. Photos and videos have a high potential for going viral on social media, amplifying certain aspects of the conflict.\nThe coverage can frame the narrative of the conflict. By selecting certain stories or images over others, the media can subtly influence whether Israel or the Palestinians are viewed more sympathetically or negatively by the audience.\nJust as the coverage of the attack on October 7 evoked intense empathy for Israelis, the current emphasis on Palestinian civilian casualties and the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza is evoking strong emotional responses from the public, including calls for a ceasefire and more humanitarian aid.\nWhat the media chooses not to report can be as impactful as what it does report. Omitting certain facts, events, or perspectives can skew public understanding of the conflict and lead to a one-sided view. The perceived bias or lack thereof in media coverage can affect public trust in media outlets. This influences how the public consumes news and which sources they consider credible.\nThe Israel-Hamas war has generated a lot of attention on social media, where users across platforms like Twitter/X, Tik Tok, and Instagram are making posts and videos about their views on the conflict. Media outlets have also shared lots of content on social media, including breaking news updates. How is social media impacting how the public is perceiving this conflict?

The main focus of the media was high morale and support for the war effort.\nIn contrast, the television news networks had a bleaker view of the war in Vietnam. After the Tet Offensive in 1968\u2014which the public saw as a defeat\u2014reports turned unfavorable toward the war effort. \u00a0The censorship that was in effect during World War II was much more lax by the 1960s. Camera crews were on-site almost constantly in combat zones. Journalists wrote day-to-day coverage and recorded their stories in the field. This gave Americans a more realistic glimpse into the lives of their soldiers, and they didn\u2019t like what they saw.\nOn April 1, 1968, the day after President Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he would not run for reelection, he stated:\n> As I sat in my office last evening, waiting to speak, I thought of the many times each week when television brings the war into the American home. No one can say exactly what effect those vivid scenes have on American opinion. Historians must only guess at the effect that television would have had during earlier conflicts on the future of this Nation: during the Korean war, for example, at that time when our forces were pushed back there to Pusan; of World War II, the Battle of the Bulge, or when our men were slugging it out in Europe or when most of our Air Force was shot down that day in June 1942 off Australia.\n]\nUS soldiers searching for Viet Cong near Laikhe, 1/8/1966. (National Archives Identifier 66956820)\nTelevising the Vietnam War helped to divide a nation that took pride in its ability to unify. The dramatization of stories in the news distorted the public\u2019s perception of what was actually happening in the field. Since it was visible in their homes, Americans were able to connect and empathize with the soldiers more than ever before. This caused an outcry of public opinion against the war.\nBy seeing the war on television, the anti-war advocates argued that the war was unnecessary, and hundreds of thousands of \u201cAmerican boys\u201d were not dying for a noble cause. In fact, they believed that the United States was involved in a war in which they shouldn\u2019t be involved at all.\n]\nU.S. soldiers searching for the Viet Cong near Tuy Hoa,...[Content truncated]",

Engagement with conflict-related images and videos creates a strong incentive for individuals pushing specific narratives to share old footage from unrelated events. Posts from X users with premium subscriptions (marked by a blue checkmark) were boosted to the top of users' news feeds. While the blue checkmark was initially\u00a0intended to foster a better user experience, it inadvertently led to the elevation of unverified and misleading content. Such content often garnered hundreds of thousands of views and engagements, spreading fabrications at an unparalleled pace.\nWhile X has garnered significant attention, other platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, and Telegram have also struggled with false information regarding the Israel-Hamas war\nWhile X has garnered significant attention, other platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, and Telegram have also struggled with false information regarding the Israel-Hamas war. Similar to previous crises, content from the conflict initially appeared on encrypted messaging platforms like\u00a0Telegram. While Telegram can serve as a primary source for footage, the lack of vetting and fact-checking on such media means that information can and is often taken out of context when shared on platforms like X. This prevalent problem underlines the challenges of addressing disinformation, as it often gains prominence due to its ability to elicit strong reactions and go viral. Each of these platforms has the power to shape public perception beyond the digital realm, potentially influencing geopolitical outcomes.\nThe EU Crackdown on Social Media Giants\nThe European Union is cracking down on tech giants to curb the rampant spread of disinformation across social media platforms. Mark Zuckerberg's Meta, the conglomerate that owns Facebook and Instagram, has been\u00a0served an injunction: comply with European law within 24 hours or face the consequences. X didn't\u00a0escape the EU's crosshairs either. Thierry Breton, the EU's industry chief, has\u00a0urged Meta and X to demonstrate \"timely, diligent, and objective action\" to combat the spread of disinformation. He had given them just one day to provide a detailed account of the \"proportionate and effective\" measures they had taken.\nBreton has demanded that Meta uphold its end of the bargain. The company has\u00a0responded by setting up a special operations center to monitor and counter the evolving situation. Still, the EU insists that the response must be comprehensive and swift. This isn't just a warning...[Content truncated]",

It is being called the first commercial space war, the first full-scale drone war, and the first AI war. The invasion is unfolding amidst a status quo where a large majority of people receive breaking news through passive scrolling. Actors in both Russia and Ukraine have found ways to sway public opinion as the battle to shape the war\u2019s historical narrative continues.\nWhile the basis of traditional battle remains the same in the twenty-first century, many of the principal components of war now have a digital foundation to them. For example, intelligence on Russian troops\u2019 border movements and military plans was leaked and trending on social media right before Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the full-scale invasion. To this day, Ukrainian civilians resisting occupation can inform their army about Russian movements through social media and specially designed apps. Geo and chrono-located smartphone footage of military aggression under occupation can now spread through social media and even serve...[Content truncated]",

The most frequently mentioned description in the latest survey was \u201cincompetent,\u201d just as it was in February 2007 and March 2006. Many of the terms offered by respondents in the December 2008 survey are negative, though the second most frequently mentioned description was honest. Good and honorable also make the list.\n### The Global Outlook\nOn the foreign stage, a solid majority of Americans say the country is significantly less respected than in the past \u2013 and many of those people see that as a major problem. Many Americans are eager to turn inward to deal with this nation\u2019s problems: fully 60% said in September 2008 that domestic policy should be the primary focus of the new president. And a greater percentage than before the Iraq war now say the best way to reduce the threat of terror is to reduce America\u2019s military presence overseas, not increase it.\nMeanwhile, a 2008 survey by the Pew Global Attitudes Project showed that majorities in 19 of the 24 nations \u2013 including several strong U.S. allies \u2013 had little confidence in Bush as he neared the end of his presidency. A 2007 survey of 45 nations found anti-American sentiment extensive as well as increasing disapproval for key elements of U.S. foreign policy.\nAnd the image of the U.S. in the Muslim world remained abysmal. Iraq, the war on terrorism and American support for Israel continued to generate animosity in the Middle East, Asia and elsewhere. In many nations considered central to the war on terror, the general public deeply distrusted the United States. Even in countries like Kuwait that have long been considered relatively pro-American, the U.S. image had declined.\nAmong the few bright spots for Bush in the Global Attitudes surveys were the African nations that had benefited from administration programs to boost economic growth and reduce the spread of AIDS. In 2008, majorities in Tanzania and Nigeria expressed confidence in the president.\nStill, Bush has had some success at home building support for tough tactics \u2013 including harsh interrogation policies for foreign detainees and government monitoring of phone calls or e-mails without warrants \u2013 to gather information about possible terrorists and stop potential attacks. On balance, more Americans say they worry that anti-terror policies have not gone far enough in protecting the United States than say they feel the anti-terror policies have \u201cgone too far in restricting civil liberties.\u201d\n### The Political Legacy\nWhen Bush took office, Republicans controlled both Congress and the White House.

Alongside the information wars being fought by the governments, militaries and authorities involved, and the reporting from accredited journalists, there is now almost unlimited potential for ordinary people caught up in events to share their own experiences. First-hand testimony and images of atrocities such as those in Bucha or Mariupol can appear on our social media feeds in real time, popping up incongruously between viral memes and cat videos.\nThis tide of unfiltered (or barely filtered) information is immediate and constant. It certainly makes a difference to the level of engagement that individuals around the world may have with dramatic events, often far away. But might that feed back to affect the course of wars themselves?\nThe technological revolution of the last three decades has linked human experiences and interactions more closely than ever before. Around two-thirds of the world\u2019s population \u2013 4.9 billion people \u2013 now have access to the internet (a number that has risen significantly during the coronavirus pandemic, by around 800 million new users). An estimated 4.4 to 4.6 billion of those use social media such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter.\nSocial media users do not just watch these events unfold in real time; they react to and interact with them. Gestures such as incorporating a Ukrainian flag into one\u2019s username may be merely symbolic, but when users lobby politicians online, donate money, or even offer up their own homes to refugees, their engagement with the war begins to have real-world consequences. Invading Russian forces seem to be aware of the potential of social media: they have targeted Ukrainian mobile communications networks, launching a missile attack on Kyivstar\u2019s hub in Okhtyrka on 11 March...[Content truncated]",
