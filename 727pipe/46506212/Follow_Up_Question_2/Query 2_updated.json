The aim is to change not only what people think, but how they think and act. Waged successfully, it shapes and influences individual and group beliefs and behaviours to favour an aggressor\u2019s tactical or strategic objectives. In its extreme form, it has the potential to fracture and fragment an entire society, so that it no longer has the collective will to resist an adversary\u2019s intentions. An opponent could conceivably subdue a society without resorting to outright force or coercion.\nThe aims of cognitive warfare can be limited, with short time horizons. Or they can be strategic, with campaigns launched over the course of decades. A single campaign could focus on the limited aim of preventing a military manoeuver from taking place as planned, or to force the alteration of a specific public policy. Several successive campaigns could be launched with...[Content truncated]",

With practice and dedication, anyone can  and become more resilient in their personal and professional lives.\n!\nUnderstanding and Managing Emotions for More Resilient Interpersonal Skills - Resilience: Bouncing Back: How Resilience Shapes Interpersonal Skills\n8\\. Building Stronger Connections Through Understanding\n-------------------------------------------------------\nEmpathy and perspective-taking are essential components of building strong interpersonal connections. It is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others, to put oneself in their shoes, and see things from their perspective. Empathy and perspective-taking promote understanding, respect, and kindness towards others, creating deeper and more meaningful relationships. Being empathetic and having the ability to take another's perspective are skills that can be learned and developed over time.\n1\\. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person. It involves recognizing and acknowledging the emotions of others, even if you don't necessarily agree with them. Empathy involves active listening, being present, and allowing the other person to express themselves freely. For example, if a friend is going through a tough time, instead of offering advice or trying to fix the problem, sit with them, listen to them, and let them know that you understand what they are going through.\n2\\. Perspective-taking is the ability to see things from another person's point of view. It involves acknowledging that everyone has their own unique experiences, beliefs, and values that shape their perspective. Perspective-taking requires an open mind and the willingness to understand someone else's viewpoint, even if it differs from your own. For instance, if you have a disagreement with a coworker, try to see the situation from their perspective. Ask questions, listen to their answers, and try to understand where they are coming from.\n3\\. Empathy and perspective-taking are . When you can understand and acknowledge someone else's feelings and perspective, it is easier to find common ground and resolve conflicts. For example, if you have a disagreement with a friend, take a step back, and try to see the situation from their perspective. Ask them questions, listen to their answers, and try to find a compromise that works for both of you.\n4\\. Empathy and perspective-taking promote deeper and more meaningful relationships. When you can understand and share another person's feelings and perspective, it creates a stronger bond between you. It shows that you care about the other person and want to understand them on a deeper level. For example, if a friend is going through a difficult...[Content truncated]",

Such an infrastructure would include a dedicated team, headed by a senior leader, with the remit to identify, prioritize, and respond to vulnerabilities. Those responses might include structural changes to the supply chain, as well as the development of detailed contingency plans for disruptive events. Introducing resilience metrics into supply chain KPIs helps the whole organization to ensure supply chain design and execution decisions are made in a way that balances efficiency and vulnerability. And because supply chain risk is a continually moving target, the organization should conduct regular stress tests and reviews to ensure its resilience measures remain appropriate.\nIncreasing supply chain agility\n-------------------------------\nCustomer loyalty is no longer a given. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, . Much of that change was driven by necessity. People went online when they couldn\u2019t access their regular stores, and two-thirds said that lack of availability was the primary reason for switching brands. The big winners of the crisis were companies, often the largest players, that could keep products flowing to their customers in a difficult operating environment.\nIn the postpandemic economy, established brands will face new challenges. As consumer-generated content replaces traditional brand marketing campaigns, companies have less control over the peaks or troughs of demand. Where a business might have once spent months preparing its supply chains for a carefully targeted promotional campaign, now a single viral video can bring attention from millions of consumers overnight. One consumer goods manufacturer experienced a surge in demand in 2020 after a video of a customer enjoying its product on a skateboard ride received millions of views and spawned dozens of imitators.\nNew players are disrupting retail channels too, widening available choices and creating space for smaller, independent manufacturers. While consumers opted for the security of big brands during the COVID-19 pandemic, a preference for smaller producers is rising, especially among younger cohorts. And the growth of comanufacturing businesses and third-party logistics (3PLs) organizations means new entrants can compete in consumer markets with fewer expensive manufacturing and supply chain assets.\nFor incumbents, the lesson is clear: move at the same speed as consumers. That means creating innovative products and brands that meet the changing needs of different consumer groups as those needs emerge. And it means greater skill in managing complex portfolios of brands with different market characteristics and delivering their products through multiple channels. These same pressures increasingly hold true for B2...[Content truncated]",

Women and girls experience the greatest impacts of climate change, which amplifies existing gender inequalities and poses unique threats to their livelihoods, health, and safety.\nAcross the world, women depend more on, yet have less access to, natural resources. In many regions, women bear a disproportionate responsibility for securing food, water, and fuel.  is the most important employment sector for women in low- and lower-middle income countries, during periods of drought and erratic rainfall, women, as agricultural workers and primary procurers, work harder to secure income and resources for their families. This puts added pressure on girls, who often have to  to help their mothers manage the increased burden.\nImage\n!\nNurun Nahar has two children and lives lives in a remote part of Islampur, Jamalpur. When floods destroyed her house in Bangladesh in 2019, she had to move to a shelter. Photo: UN Women/Mohammad Rakibul Hasan.\nClimate change is a \u201cthreat multiplier\u201d, meaning it escalates social, political and economic tensions in fragile and conflict-affected settings. As climate change drives conflict across the world, women and girls face increased vulnerabilities to all forms of gender-based violence, including conflict-related sexual violence, human trafficking, child marriage, and other forms of violence.\nWhen disasters strike, women are  and more likely to be injured due to long standing gender inequalities that have created disparities in information, mobility, decision-making, and access to resources and training. In the aftermath, women and girls are less able to access relief and assistance, further threatening their livelihoods, wellbeing and recovery, and creating a vicious cycle of vulnerability to future disasters.\nWomen\u2019s and girls\u2019 health is endangered by climate change and disasters by limiting access to services and health care, as well as increasing risks related to maternal and child health. Research indicates that extreme heat increases incidence of stillbirth, and climate change is increasing the spread of vector-borne illnesses such as malaria, dengue fever, and Zika virus, which are linked to .\nImage\n!\nTurkana county is one of the most arid areas of Kenya.
