Times, the Boston Globe, and The Washington Post, signed an open letter condemning Israel’s killing of reporters in Gaza and criticizing the war coverage in Western media. The signatories argue for the use of precise terms like \"apartheid\" and \"ethnic cleansing\" to describe Israel’s treatment of Palestinians, pointing out the double standards in reporting.\nInternational media outlets tend to provide a more diverse range of perspectives, often highlighting the humanitarian impacts on Palestinian civilians. These outlets are generally more direct in critiquing Israeli policies and actions, and they demonstrate a greater willingness to use terms that US media might shy away from. The BBC, for example, has been harshly criticized for a perceived anti-Israeli bias, including referring to Hamas as “militants,” as opposed to terrorists, and interviewing guests who praised the Hamas attack. This broader and sometimes more critical vocabulary in international coverage reflects a less conservative approach to the conflict than in American media.\nSome US media outlets have been  for their coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. How does the media’s choice of what stories to cover in conflict and what photos/videos to show in their coverage impact public perception?\nThrough their framing, selection of stories, and use of visual media, news outlets have immense power to influence public opinion. Photos and videos have a high potential for going viral on social media, amplifying certain aspects of the conflict.\nThe coverage can frame the narrative of the conflict. By selecting certain stories or images over others, the media can subtly influence whether Israel or the Palestinians are viewed more sympathetically or negatively by the audience.\nJust as the coverage of the attack on October 7 evoked intense empathy for Israelis, the current emphasis on Palestinian civilian casualties and the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza is evoking strong emotional responses from the public, including calls for a ceasefire and more humanitarian aid.\nWhat the media chooses not to report can be as impactful as what it does report. Omitting certain facts, events, or perspectives can skew public understanding of the conflict and lead to a one-sided view. The perceived bias or lack thereof in media coverage can affect public trust in media outlets. This influences how the public consumes news and which sources they consider credible.\nThe Israel-Hamas war has generated a lot of attention on social media, where users across platforms like Twitter/X, Tik Tok, and Instagram are making posts and videos about their views on the conflict. Media outlets have also shared lots of content on social media, including breaking news updates. How is social media impacting how the public is perceiving this conflict?

Posts from X users with premium subscriptions (marked by a blue checkmark) were boosted to the top of users' news feeds.

Similar to previous crises, content from the conflict initially appeared on encrypted messaging platforms like Telegram. While Telegram can serve as a primary source for footage, the lack of vetting and fact-checking on such media means that information can and is often taken out of context when shared on platforms like X. This prevalent problem underlines the challenges of addressing disinformation, as it often gains prominence due to its ability to elicit strong reactions and go viral. Each of these platforms has the power to shape public perception beyond the digital realm, potentially influencing geopolitical outcomes.\nThe EU Crackdown on Social Media Giants\nThe European Union is cracking down on tech giants to curb the rampant spread of disinformation across social media platforms. Mark Zuckerberg's Meta, the conglomerate that owns Facebook and Instagram, has been served an injunction: comply with European law within 24 hours or face the consequences. X didn't escape the EU's crosshairs either. Thierry Breton, the EU's industry chief, has urged Meta and X to demonstrate \"timely, diligent, and objective action\" to combat the spread of disinformation. He had given them just one day to provide a detailed account of the \"proportionate and effective\" measures they had taken.\nBreton has demanded that Meta uphold its end of the bargain. The company has responded by setting up a special operations center to monitor and counter the evolving situation. Still, the EU insists that the response must be comprehensive and swift.

The Israeli army was planning for another “battle like we’ve never experienced before,” the anonymous woman said in Hebrew, warning that people should prepare to lose access to food, water and internet service for a week.\nAcross the country, Israelis raced to the banks and to the grocery stores, anticipating another attack. But the message, the army clarified hours later on X, turned out to be a falsehood.\nOne week into the war between Israel and Gaza, social media is inducing a fog of war surpassing previous clashes in the region — one that’s shaping how panicked citizens and a global public view the conflict.\nSocial media has long played a critical role in battles in the area. During the 11-day war between Israel and Hamas in 2021, posts of carnage in Gaza rallied the public to the Palestinian cause. Researchers say increased internet access and the spread of smartphones enabled a watershed moment, revealing how tech platforms could show the horror and human toll of such events.\nBut now, a volatile, months-long fight over Israel’s democratic future has primed conspiracies and false information to spread within its borders. Tech platforms, diminished from waves of layoffs, have receded from policing falsehoods, disinformation and hate speech online. Electricity outages and strikes on telecommunications infrastructure in Gaza threaten Palestinians’ connectivity, according to human rights organizations.\nElon Musk's X faces EU probe over handling of Israel-Gaza war\nWhile social media has been a critical tool for disseminating wartime information in recent days, a barrage of images, memes and testimonials is making it difficult to assess what is real.

The domains of space and cyber, for example, came out of developments in rocket, satellite, computing, telecommunications, and internetworking technologies. The increasingly widespread use of social media, social networking, social messaging, and mobile device technologies is now enabling a new domain: cognitive warfare.\nIn cognitive warfare, the human mind becomes the battlefield. The aim is to change not only what people think, but how they think and act. Waged successfully, it shapes and influences individual and group beliefs and behaviours to favour an aggressor’s tactical or strategic objectives. In its extreme form, it has the potential to fracture and fragment an entire society, so that it no longer has the collective will to resist an adversary’s intentions. An opponent could conceivably subdue a society without resorting to outright force or coercion.\nThe aims of cognitive warfare can be limited, with short time horizons. Or they can be strategic, with campaigns launched over the course of decades.

Engagement with conflict-related images and videos creates a strong incentive for individuals pushing specific narratives to share old footage from unrelated events. Posts from X users with premium subscriptions (marked by a blue checkmark) were boosted to the top of users' news feeds. While the blue checkmark was initially intended to foster a better user experience, it inadvertently led to the elevation of unverified and misleading content. Such content often garnered hundreds of thousands of views and engagements, spreading fabrications at an unparalleled pace.\nWhile X has garnered significant attention, other platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, and Telegram have also struggled with false information regarding the Israel-Hamas war\nWhile X has garnered significant attention, other platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, and Telegram have also struggled with false information regarding the Israel-Hamas war. Similar to previous crises, content from the conflict initially appeared on encrypted messaging platforms like Telegram. While Telegram can serve as a primary source for footage, the lack of vetting and fact-checking on such media means that information can and is often taken out of context when shared on platforms like X. This prevalent problem underlines the challenges of addressing disinformation, as it often gains prominence due to its ability to elicit strong reactions and go viral. Each of these platforms has the power to shape public perception beyond the digital realm, potentially influencing geopolitical outcomes.\nThe EU Crackdown on Social Media Giants\nThe European Union is cracking down on tech giants to curb the rampant spread of disinformation across social media platforms. Mark Zuckerberg's Meta, the conglomerate that owns Facebook and Instagram, has been served an injunction: comply with European law within 24 hours or face the consequences. X didn't escape the EU's crosshairs either. Thierry Breton, the EU's industry chief, has urged Meta and X to demonstrate \"timely, diligent, and objective action\" to combat the spread of disinformation. He had given them just one day to provide a detailed account of the \"proportionate and effective\" measures they had taken.\nBreton has demanded that Meta uphold its end of the bargain. The company has responded by setting up a special operations center to monitor and counter the evolving situation. Still, the EU insists that the response must be comprehensive and swift.

The Israeli army was planning for another “battle like we’ve never experienced before,” the anonymous woman said in Hebrew, warning that people should prepare to lose access to food, water and internet service for a week.\nAcross the country, Israelis raced to the banks and to the grocery stores, anticipating another attack. But the message, the army clarified hours later on X, turned out to be a falsehood.\nOne week into the war between Israel and Gaza, social media is inducing a fog of war surpassing previous clashes in the region — one that’s shaping how panicked citizens and a global public view the conflict.\nSocial media has long played a critical role in battles in the area. During the 11-day war between Israel and Hamas in 2021, posts of carnage in Gaza rallied the public to the Palestinian cause. Researchers say increased internet access and the spread of smartphones enabled a watershed moment, revealing how tech platforms could show the horror and human toll of such events.\nBut now, a volatile, months-long fight over Israel’s democratic future has primed conspiracies and false information to spread within its borders. Tech platforms, diminished from waves of layoffs, have receded from policing falsehoods, disinformation and hate speech online. Electricity outages and strikes on telecommunications infrastructure in Gaza threaten Palestinians’ connectivity, according to human rights organizations.\nElon Musk's X faces EU probe over handling of Israel-Gaza war\nWhile social media has been a critical tool for disseminating wartime information in recent days, a barrage of images, memes and testimonials is making it difficult to assess what is real. Activists in the region warn that viral horror stories that turn out not to be true may lead people to further distrust authority figures — and could spark hate, violence and retaliation against innocent people.\n“I’m terrified,” Marwa Fatafta, a policy analyst...[Content truncated]"

        "Question": "What are the broader implications of viral videos depicting leisure activities in wartime on public perception of the conflict?",
        "Answer": "Viral videos depicting leisure activities in wartime can significantly shape public perception of the conflict in several ways: 1. Creation of a Misleading Narrative: Such viral videos may contribute to the false perception that life is normal in war-torn areas, which can lead audiences to underestimate the severity of the conflict. When people see scenes of leisure and social gatherings, they might interpret these activities as signs that the war is not as pressing or destructive as reports suggest. This distortion of reality can manifest in a more sympathetic view of the aggressors in the conflict or a belief that the war is exaggerated or even fabricated. The media's framing of these moments is critical, as it can influence how audiences perceive the overall nature of the conflict, reiterating that selective storytelling impacts public opinion significantly. 2. Psychological Impact on Audiences: The dissemination of these videos can evoke strong emotional responses from viewers. While they might initially prompt feelings of curiosity or humor, they can ultimately lead to confusion and skepticism about the realities on the ground. The viral nature of such content means that individuals who engage with these videos could start believing in a diluted narrative of the conflict, thereby affecting their propensity to support humanitarian efforts or understand the true dangers faced by civilians in war zones. Moreover, as reported, misinformation often prevails, skewing public understanding and creating a 'fog of war' where discernments of truth become increasingly difficult. 3. Normalization of Conflict: The presence of leisure activities depicted in viral content can lead to a normalization of the conflict. Audiences might begin to view continuous warfare as a background aspect of life in affected areas, diminishing the urgency of international response to humanitarian crises. Such perception can limit public empathy and responsiveness to those suffering as it integrates war into the daily narrative of life, thereby diluting calls for action against the ongoing violence. 4. Influence on Geopolitical Awareness and Action: This shift in perception can potentially influence political decisions and public stances regarding foreign aid and military support. By obscuring the gravity of the situation, viral videos may hamper advocacy efforts aimed at addressing injustices and suffering caused by the conflict. As seen in various historical contexts, media representation profoundly impacts how governments and citizens engage with foreign conflicts, which could ultimately shape international policy and response. In conclusion, while viral videos highlighting leisure amidst conflict may capture moments of human resilience, they also carry significant risks of misrepresentation and misunderstanding. This phenomenon underscores the complex interplay between media, public perception, and geopolitical action during wartime.",
