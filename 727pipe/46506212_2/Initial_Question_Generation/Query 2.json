[+] which is allowed to visit by the city authorities on August 13, 2023 in Odesa, Ukraine. In Odesa six beaches were officially opened for swimming - for the first time since the start of a full-scale war.  (смысловой повтор текста). However, people also continue to swim on the other beaches of the city, where swimming is prohibited. (Photo by Viacheslav Onyshchenko/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)\nA number of videos featuring bikini-clad women made the rounds on Twitter this weekend, but not for the reasons some might expect. The clips purported to show a beach on the Black Sea near the Ukrainian city of Odesa after it reportedly reopened for the first time since Russia's invasion.\nThe post was met with a backlash as those critical of U.S. and other Western aid being provided to Ukraine voiced their frustration that it didn't resemble a warzone. However, other users on Twitter soon weighed in that the video was actually filmed at the Strandbad Plötzensee, a lake in the city of Berlin, Germany!\nAnother video also circulated showing a party-like gathering at the Ibiza Beach Club in Odesa. It does resemble the images and videos on the club's official website, and it is—or at least was—a very popular hotspot, yet, it remains unclear when the video may have actually been filmed. The club's Facebook page hasn't been updated since 2018 and no videos have been posted to its YouTube page since July of 2021—more than six months before Russia launched its unprovoked invasion.\nIt would appear that the Ibiza Beach Club in Odesa may still be closed.\nHowever, there is a grain of truth to the story. As Reuters reported on Saturday, several beaches in the city have been officially opened for swimming, but bathing in the sea is banned during air raid alerts. It is also important to note the city has been repeatedly attacked with missiles and drones, while the waters have been littered with hundreds of sea mines. In other words, people may be swimming in Ukraine, but it is hardly the party atmosphere some on social media have suggested.\n\"This is a classic piece of disinformation. There are a few interesting things about this. First, this...[Content truncated]",

CBS News/Agnes Reau\nPerhaps it's an act of defiance.\nIt certainly is when they have to quite literally pick up the pieces and figure out how, or if, to carry on.\nThat was the stark choice for the people who worked and relaxed at the Hemingway Bar. There isn't much left of the building that previously housed apartments and the bar, which had been turned into a bomb shelter. It took a direct hit in the early days of the war, killing and wounding those inside.\nGrim irony for a bar named after the legendary war author Earnest Hemingway.\nUndeterred, the people behind the bar reopened it just a few blocks away as soon as they could.\n\"I had mixed feelings,\" owner Konstantin Kuts told CBS News. \"Because I lost my business, but I did not lose my life.

In Djugu territory, ethnic Lendu militia CODECO 20 June killed 25 civilians in Bianda village and same day killed at least 36 in Lodjo village.\nM23 rebels extended offensive northward in North Kivu. Advancing from early June onwards, M23 28 June seized strategic Kanyabayonga town on Route Nationale 2, important gateway to commercial Butembo and Beni towns, and took Kirumba town two days later; expansion opened up access to Lubero territory, north of main hotspots of Masisi and Rutshuru territories where military and allies continued to clash with M23. Fighting displaced tens of thousands including north toward Beni territory, while thousands sought refuge in provincial capital Goma; displacement to neighbouring South Kivu province also contributed to deteriorating security and humanitarian conditions there, including in Minova town which remained in line of rebel mortar fire. Meanwhile, leaked UN report noted heavy Rwandan military presence in North Kivu (see Rwanda).\nNew govt took office after months of delay. National Assembly 11 June endorsed new 54-member strong govt under PM Suminwa, dominated by President Tshisekedi’s Union for Democracy and Social Progress and close associates.

Americans don’t GET INVADED. I would LOVE to go to UKRAINE this war is a JOKE!”\n> 🔥🚨BREAKING: Democrats are saying Americans party when they are at war. Americans don’t GET INVADED. I would LOVE to go to UKRAINE this war is a JOKE! \n> \n> — Dom Lucre | Breaker of Narratives (@dom\\_lucre) \nThe video, which quickly garnered significant attention, has raised questions about its authenticity and Lucre's intentions. Critics argued that the footage's validity was unproven and that such posts could spread misinformation.\nHowever, the platform’s users have stepped forward to scrutinize the video's origins, tracing it back to a luxury rental villa outside Tel Aviv.\n1 View gallery\n!!\nThe video from Israel was mispresented as being shot in Ukraine\n(Photo: Screenshot)\nUkraine, since the beginning of the conflict with Russia, has been receiving various forms of assistance from the international community, including the United States. Lucre's post implies a narrative that the aid might be misused or that the country isn't in dire need.\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump and other conservative figures have been critical of the large amounts of aid the Biden administration has provided to Ukraine during the war, which the 77-year-old presidential hopeful claims he can \"end in 24 hours\" if reelected.",
