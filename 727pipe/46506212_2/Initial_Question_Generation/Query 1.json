In announcing his invasion in February 2022, Putin threatened any country that tried to interfere in Ukraine with consequences \"such as you have never seen in your entire history.\"] He went on to order a \"special regime of combat duty\" for Russia's nuclear forces a week later.] In October 2022, Moscow alleged that Kyiv was planning to detonate a radioactive \"dirty bomb\" in Ukraine as a false flag operation and then blame Russia. U.S. officials worried that Russia was promoting this story to create a pretext for using nuclear weapons.] And perhaps most disconcertingly, Western governments appear to have become convinced that Moscow considered using nonstrategic nuclear weapons (NSNW) as its forces lost ground in the fall. Russia has denied these allegations, but news reports suggest that top Russian commanders did discuss this option.]\nSome analysts have dismissed the possibility of NSNW use, contending that Russia knows that employment of nuclear weapons would be self-defeating. They point to the lack of high-value military targets (for example, concentrated Ukrainian forces) that could be effectively destroyed with such weapons and to the risk that these weapons might harm Russian troops deployed in Ukraine. Use of these weapons could provoke NATO's entry into the war, erode Russia's remaining international support, and spark domestic political backlash for the Kremlin. Knowing this, the logic goes, Russia would be deterred from using nuclear weapons.]\nThese arguments ignore several issues that make Russian use of nuclear weapons both a plausible contingency that Washington needs to account for and a hugely important factor in determining the future trajectory of the conflict. First, there is evidence that the Kremlin perceives this war to be near existential. Ukraine has long been in a category of its own in Russian foreign policy priorities; even before the 2022 war, Russia was willing to devote significant resources and make major trade-offs to pursue its objectives in Ukraine.] For example, Moscow paid dearly for its 2014 annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine. Western sanctions cost an average of 2 percent in quarter-on-quarter decline in Russia's gross domestic product between mid-2014 and mid-2015, an effect that compounded as the sanctions continued in subsequent years.] Putin's decision to launch a full-scale invasion in February 2022, despite clear warnings from the United States and its allies that he would pay a much higher price than in 2014, shows that he is willing to go to even more-extreme lengths to pursue...[Content truncated]",

I’ve lived through it before: power grabbing, fascism and racism – the destruction of democracy. Israel is going where South Africa was 75 years ago. It’s like watching the replay of a horror movie.\nIn 1948, as a teenager in Cape Town, I followed the results of the 26 May election on a giant board on a newspaper building. The winner-takes-all electoral system produced distorted results: the Afrikaner Nationalist party, with its smaller partner, won 79 parliamentary seats against 74 for the United party and its smaller partner.\nBut the Nats, as they were called, in fact won only 37.7% of the vote against the opposition’s 49.2%. Although the opposition received more votes, the Nats said they had a majority and could do what they wanted.\nIn the Israel of 2023, I’m reliving some of these same experiences. Our proportional election system can distort results as well: last November, Likud, with its smaller partners, won 64 seats against 56 for the opposition. In fact, the rightwing bloc won by only 0.6% of the vote. The 0.6% government says it represents the will of the majority and can do whatever it wants. South Africa enjoyed democracy – that is, among the whites who made up 20% of the population. Black people had no right to vote; only some so-called Coloureds and Asian South Africans could vote. Those who were not white suffered heavy racial discrimination in every part of their lives.\nIn Israel, Arabs, who form about 21% of the population, can vote.

On May 11 separatists held referenda and declared the formation of autonomous “people’s republics” in Donetsk (DNR) and Luhansk (LNR), but the separatist movement in Kharkiv largely fizzled. In the Donets Basin (Donbas), skirmishes between Russian-backed militias and government forces intensified, and dozens of pro-Russian separatists were killed in a battle over Donetsk’s international airport.\nOn May 25 chocolate magnate Petro Poroshenko easily won the Ukrainian presidential election, which took place without the participation of Crimea and much of the Donbas. Poroshenko promised to step up an Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO) to regain the occupied territories. In separatist regions the new governments were taken over by militants, including some from Russia. The most prominent among them was Strelkov, the nom de guerre of Igor Girkin, a former colonel with the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), who established his headquarters in Slov’yansk. Poroshenko was inaugurated on June 7, and he immediately introduced a proposal to restore peace in separatist-controlled regions. Fighting continued, however, and on June 13 government forces reclaimed the city of Mariupol.\nATO forces liberated Slov’yansk on July 5, but Strelkov and about 8,000 men established a new base in Donetsk. Units under Strelkov’s command were believed to have been responsible for the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 near Hrabove on July 17. All 298 people aboard, most of whom were citizens of the Netherlands, were killed. On August 14 Strelkov reportedly resigned his position and left Ukraine. A Dutch inquiry would later determine that the aircraft was shot down by a Russian-made Buk surface-to-air missile system, and four individuals—all of whom were associated with the Russian-backed military operation in eastern Ukraine—were identified as suspects. The most prominent among these was Strelkov; in November 2022 a Dutch court found Strelkov and two others guilty of murder.\nBy the end of July, the EU and the U.S. had increased sanctions on Russia, freezing bank accounts and banning travel by prominent officials. In late August regular Russian troops entered Ukraine and surrounded Ukrainian troops at Ilovaisk, where they killed hundreds. In spite of overwhelming evidence of direct Russian participation in the conflict, the Kremlin insisted that it was not intervening in Ukraine. After separatist...[Content truncated]",

Overall, the legal framework remains \nconducive to the organisation of democratic elections. Reform of the electoral legal framework \nshould be continued to address outstanding recommendations by the OSCE Office for \nDemocratic Institutio ns and Human Rights (ODIHR). \nThe work of the Parliament (Verkhovna Rada) continues to be marked by extraordinary \ncircumstances related to the Russian military aggression. However, legislative tasks are carried \nout systematically, laying the ground for an uninterrupted democratic decision -making process. \nKey de cisions, especially on defence/security questions, were adopted by clear cross -party \nmajorities. Considerable attention was paid to legislation related to EU integration. The Rada \nperformed important symbolic functions, while concerns were raised about lim ited \ntransparency on security grounds and weakened oversight of the executive. \nUkraine has some level of preparation in the area of public administration reform , with \nlimited progress made during the reporting period. While the Ukrainian public administration \nhas proved its resilience during the full -scale invasion, reform has slowed or stopped in a \nnumber of sectors, in particular in merit -based recruitment and selection, job classification and \nsalary reform, as well as the roll -out of the human resources management information system. \nThe digitalisation of service delivery has reached a high level. \nOn multi -level governance , the achievements of decentralisation reform continued, with \nmunicipalities acting as a pillar of Ukrainian resilience. Ove rall, following the successful \nfinalisation of the territorial part of decentralisation, other elements of the reform still need to \nbe completed. Local self -government in the liberated territories and those near the frontlines \nshould be gradually restored where the security situation allows it. The newly established \nMinistry of Restoration should synergise infrastructure and the regional development portfolio \nto stimulate locally driven recovery and reconstruction based on the systematic involvement of \nloca l authorities and associations.

Putin is certain to win, given a rigged electoral system in which anti-regime opposition figures have been jailed or forced to flee the country to avoid arrest.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov last week declined to comment on reports that Putin had decided to run, noting that the Russian leader had “not made any statement.”\nIn Russia, with its long history of electoral manipulation, the main speculation is about who would be part of an “initiative group” of citizens put together by the Kremlin to nominate Putin — part of an effort to create an air of excitement and clamor for the 71-year-old to run again.\nAmong the names reported by the Kommersant newspaper Monday as likely members of the group were a blonde nationalistic singer with the stage name Shaman; the first Russian woman in space, 86-year-old Valentina Tereshkova; 78-year-old film director Nikita Mikhalkov; and a 90-year-old Russian pediatrician, Leonid Roshal.\nAnother formality is choosing which candidates will run against Putin. Possible challengers include the longtime Communist Party leader, Gennady Zyuganov, who is 79, and the leader of the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party, Leonid Slutsky, 55. Neither has announced a decision.\nThe two men are among the few party leaders not barred from running, unlike the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny and others, most of whom have been imprisoned for political reasons.\nCritics say Zyuganov and Slutsky are not real opposition figures but are co-opted in a system designed to create a veneer of democracy, without any real threat to Putin or his regime.\nNavalny is sentenced to 19 years for ‘extremism’ as Kremlin crushes dissent\nRussian authorities typically bar candidates seen as a threat, with Grigory Yavlinsky, co-founder of the progressive Yabloko party, prevented from running in 2012 and Navalny barred in 2018.\nAmong the handful of candidates who have announced they will run is opposition pundit Boris Nadezhdin, a member of the local council in the Dolgoprudny municipality of the Moscow region, who frequently appears on state television and calls the war in Ukraine “a fatal mistake.”\nTo pave the way for holding elections in areas of occupied Ukraine, Putin on Tuesday signed a...[Content truncated]",
