Toth Fox\n\n\n              May 17, 2024\n              \u00b7\n              6 min read\n            \n\nCatherine Toth Fox\n\nVisiting the whole island can help stimulate the local economy, still reeling nine months after the fires.\nAt the end of April, I visited the Westin Maui Resort & Spa on the sunny coast of Kaanapali, about 3 miles north of Lahaina. The high-end hotel had just wrapped up a $160 million transformation and invited media to tour the property.\nAnd it was everything you\u2019d expect a multimillion-dollar renovation would look like: an infinity-edged cocktail pool in one of its renovated towers, spacious cabanas complete with chaise lounges and flat-screen TVs, gorgeous suites with sweeping views of the ocean.\nAnd yet, even now, at the beginning of what should be the busiest season for travel to the islands, the property \u2014\u00a0and the surrounding beach and shops \u2014 weren\u2019t busy at all. Let\u2019s just say there weren\u2019t any long lines at Ulu Kitchen, the new restaurant by chef Peter Merriman at the hotel, and finding a secluded spot on the typically busy Kaanapali Beach was surprisingly easy.\nTravel to Maui was down 25.5% in March compared to last year, according to the Hawaii Tourism Authority. Visitor spending and hotel occupancy on Maui are down, too. While U.S. visitor arrivals to Maui were the highest it\u2019s been since the deadly August 2023 wildfires \u2014 in the wake of the fire, arrivals by air to Maui had dropped to as much as 51.4% \u2014\u00a0the numbers are significantly down from where they should be.\nHonestly, I had mixed feelings about visiting West Maui. At the time it had been about nine months since the wildfires destroyed the oceanfront town of Lahaina, killing at least 101 people and displacing thousands more. Right outside the hotel, the Lahaina Strong group had been occupying Kaanapali Beach as part of its Fishing for Housing initiative, urging government officials to find long-term \u201cdignified housing\u201d for fire survivors. (The group ended its occupation of the beach after I left.)\nAnd here I was, enjoying a mai tai steps from their encampment. To say I was conflicted was an understatement.\nBut the folks at the hotel, many of them personally affected by the wildfires, assured me my visit was wanted \u2014 and needed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s personal, sacred, spiritual to people,\u201d explained Jared Kahaialii, the hotel\u2019s assistant spa director whose family home was destroyed. He ran the donation hub at the hotel, which provided housing to more than 250 displaced residents. He understands the importance of visitors returning to Maui to strengthen the county\u2019s...[Content truncated]",
