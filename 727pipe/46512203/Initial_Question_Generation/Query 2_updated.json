The Congressional Budget Office found that taking away this funding \u2013 some of which the Biden administration said will go toward increased audits of high-income individuals and large corporations \u2013 would result in a loss of nearly $186 billion in government revenue between 2023 and 2032, for a net increase to the deficit of about $114 billion.\n    \n\n            The Republican bill has no chance of becoming law under Biden, who has vowed to veto it in the highly unlikely event it got through the Democratic-controlled Senate. \n    \n\n            Biden said that \u201cMAGA Republicans\u201d in the House \u201cwant to impose a 30 percent national sales tax on everything from food, clothing, school supplies, housing, cars \u2013 a whole deal.\u201d He said they want to do that because \u201cthey want to eliminate the income tax system.\u201d \n    \n\nFacts First: This is a fair description of the Republicans\u2019 \u201cFairTax\u201d bill. The bill would eliminate federal income taxes, plus the payroll tax, capital gains tax and estate tax, and replace it with a national sales tax. The bill describes a rate of 23% on the \u201cgross payments\u201d on a product or service, but when the tax rate is described in the way consumers are used to sales taxes being described, it\u2019s actually right around 30%, as a pro-FairTax website acknowledges.\n\n\n            It is not clear how much support the bill currently has among the House Republican caucus. Notably, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju this week that he opposes the bill \u2013 though, while seeking right-wing votes for his bid for speaker in early January, he promised its supporters that it would be considered in committee. Biden wryly said in his speech, \u201cThe Republican speaker says he\u2019s not so sure he\u2019s for it.\u201d\n    \n\n            Biden claimed the unemployment rate \u201cis the lowest it\u2019s been in 50 years.\u201d\n    \n\nFacts First: This is true. The unemployment rate was just below 3.5% in December, the lowest figure since 1969. \n\n\n            The headline monthly rate, which is rounded to a single decimal place, was reported as 3.5% in December and also reported as 3.5% in three months of President Donald Trump\u2019s tenure, in late 2019 and in early 2020. But if you look at more precise figures, December was indeed the lowest since 1969 \u2013 3.47% \u2013 just below the figures...[Content truncated]",

We will never know, although certain science points out to the fact that we very well could have avoided those catastrophic deaths, many of them, if water had made it to the site of the fires on time.\u201d\u2014 at a conservative conference in Atlanta in August\nThis lacks evidence. Mr. Ramaswamy was referring to M. Kaleo Manuel, the deputy director for Hawaii\u2019s Commission on Water Resource Management, and overstating his ties to President Barack Obama as well as the potential effect of the requested water diversion.\nFirst, Mr. Manuel is not an \u201cObama appointee\u201d but rather participated in a leadership development program run by the Obama Foundation in 2019. Mr. Ramaswamy and other conservative personalities have derided comments Mr. Manuel made last year when he said that native Hawaiians like himself used to consider water something to \u201crevere\u201d and something that \u201cgives us life.\u201d\nOn Aug. 8, the day wildfire engulfed a historic town in Hawaii, Mr. Manuel was contacted by the West Maui Land Company, a real estate developer that supplies water to areas southeast of the town of Lahaina on Maui island, The New York Times has reported. Noting high winds and drought, the company requested permission to fill a private reservoir for fire control, though the reservoir was not connected to fire hydrants. No fire was blazing in the area at the time.\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Hear his reply\n\n\n            \u201cThere are many elements of wildfire mitigation that don\u2019t get counted specifically as mitigation activities, including vegetation management, grid hardening and pole replacement and routine line and equipment inspections,\u201d the company said.\n    \n\n            A sensor network run by Whisker Labs detected an \u201cincreasingly stressed utility grid\u201d on Maui beginning late August 7 and into the next morning, the company\u2019s CEO Bob Marshall told CNN on Wednesday.\n    \n\n            \u201cThrough the overnight hours, when all the fires ignited, we measured 122 individual faults on the utility grid,\u201d Marshall said. A fault \u2013 a short circuit or partial short circuit \u2013 could cause electric current to leave its intended path, which could lead to a fire, Marshall said.\n    \n\n\nTourists lost their summer vacations. Maui's locals lost everything\n\n\n            Video taken at the Maui Bird Conservation Center in Makawao appears to show a power pole faulting just before 11 p.m. on August 7. Soon after, what appears to be flames are seen in the video, first reported by The Washington Post.\n    \n\n            The sensor system provided \u201cverification that, indeed, this was very likely caused by a fault on the utility grid,\u201d Marshall said.\n    \n\n            The Makawao fire was hours before and miles away from the fire that decimated the historic portions of Lahaina in Western Maui. But sensors detected faults on the grid before that fire, too, Marshall said.\n    \n\nA class-action lawsuit filed over the weekend alleges the wildfires were caused by Hawaiian Electric\u2019s energized power lines that were knocked down by strong winds.\n    \n\n\nHawaii delayed diverting water that could have helped Maui wildfires, letters obtained by CNN allege\n\n\n            The company and its subsidiaries \u201cchose not to deenergize their power lines after they knew some poles and lines had fallen and were in contact with the vegetation or the ground,\u201d the suit alleges.\n    \n\n            Precautionary shutoffs have to be arranged with first responders, Hawaiian Electric Vice President Jim Kelly told CNN on Sunday in an email, adding the company doesn\u2019t comment on pending litigation.\n    \n\n            \u201cElectricity powers the pumps that provide the water needed for firefighting,\u201d Kelly said.\n    \n\n            Hawaiian Electric is also eager to find answers, a company spokesperson said. \n    \n\n            \u201cWe know there is speculation about what started the...[Content truncated]",
