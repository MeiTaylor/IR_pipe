The Maui Police Department and the FBI have released the list of 31 individuals still unaccounted for following the fires. Yet an Instagram post falsely claims \u201cover 1,000 children are missing.\u201d The wildfires in Maui started on Aug. 8 and burned for days.

It does take a lot of time. This is a mass disaster.\u201d The county of Maui has released reports on those still unaccounted for following the fires.

A list identifying the missing was released by the Maui Police Department and the FBI, with one person identified as a minor. But an online video, titled \u201cOver 1,000 Missing Children in Maui,\u201d falsely claims that 1,050 kids are \u201cgone without a trace.\u201d The video goes on to say, \u201cThey have absolutely no clue where these children are.\u201d The numbers given in the video ...

A night-time video showing streaks of green light in the sky over Hawaii predates the August 2023 wildfires in the U.S. state by several months. The lights were filmed by Japan\u2019s Subaru-Asahi Star Camera in January 2023 and emanate from a Chinese weather satellite launched in April 2022. As wildfires raged in Hawaii in August 2023, social media users posted the footage with the baseless suggestion that it was evidence of \u201cDirected Energy Weapons\u201d that were used to ignite the fires. Examples are visible on Instagram () and TikTok (). The posts refer to a conspiracy theory that the fires were intentionally started by \u201cDirected Energy Weapons\u201d (DEWs) \u2013 a technology that fires high-energy lasers and microwaves at the speed of light, according to the US Government Accountability Office (). The 2023 wildfires in Maui, killed over a 100, making it the deadliest wildfire in the U.S. in more than a century, Reuters reported ().
