        "Question": "Does the video accurately depict President Trump visiting Maui after the August 2023 wildfires?",
        "Answer": "The video does not accurately depict President Trump visiting Maui after the August 2023 wildfires. The evidence shows that the footage in question was actually from a 2019 visit by Trump to Beauregard, Alabama, following a tornado that struck the area, not from any recent visit to Maui. Multiple fact-checking sources confirm that the video, which was circulating online as if it showed Trump visiting Maui, was misleading. Specifically, Snopes reported that the video depicted Trump speaking to volunteers in Alabama, and the content of the videos matched his comments from that past event, rather than any visit related to the fires in Maui. Additionally, USA Today corroborated this by stating that the video shared on social media was years old and featured Trump in Alabama, not Maui. The fact-check noted the specifics of the setting and identified it as a disaster relief visit unrelated to the August 2023 wildfires. Given this analysis, it is clear that the video is falsely representing Trump's actions in relation to the Maui disaster, and the claim is unfounded.",
