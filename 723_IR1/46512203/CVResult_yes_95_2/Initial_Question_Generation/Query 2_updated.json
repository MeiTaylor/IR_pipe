Many falsely showed the arrest of the former president, who may face indictment over payment of hush money to a woman he allegedly had an affair with. He has not yet been charged with a crime. Many of those sharing the images pointed out they were fake, and they did not appear to fool lots of people - but a few did seem to be tricked. On Thursday, Mr Trump also shared an AI-generated image on his own social media platform Truth Social. It showed him kneeling in prayer. What are some of the tell-tale signs of AI-generated imagery? And how can you distinguish a real from a fake? The images circulating online, like the one above, look hyper-real - more like staged artistic shots than in-the-moment photographs. A closer look shows some obvious giveaways that something isn't quite right. Look at the centre of the image. Mr Trump's arm is much too short, and the police officer on the left is grabbing something that more resembles a claw than a human hand. Similarly, if you focus on Mr Trump's neck, you'll notice that his head looks as if it's been superimposed on the image. Henry Ajder, an AI expert and presenter of the BBC radio series The Future Will be Synthesised, says current technology is not very good at depicting certain body parts, especially hands. \"If you zoom in on the images you can often see inconsistencies such as the number of fingers,\" he says. A simple check of a few news sites is a sure-fire way to verify that Mr Trump hasn't been arrested or even indicted - at least, not yet. If and when Mr Trump does ... [Content truncated]",

Fox News host Sean Hannity was among those who shared low-resolution video on X, the social media app formerly known as Twitter. Hannity\u2019s post was viewed more than 425,000 times within a few hours, and similar videos posted by others received thousands more views on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok. Higher-resolution from the nonpartisan network C-SPAN shows that Biden looked downward for about 10 seconds while he was seated at a table. In the video, Biden watches someone who\u2019s speaking, coughs, looks downward and then nods in agreement with the speaker. Then he looks up again. He later delivered a speech to the same audience. The higher-resolution video shows that Biden kept his eyes open for most of the time he was looking downward. His open eyes aren\u2019t clearly visible in the lower-quality videos. At least one member of Congress, Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, also shared the lower-resolution version on X. A spokesperson for Nehls said in a statement: \u201cEveryone with eyes can draw their own conclusion about whether President Biden was nodding off in the video.\u201d Asked for comment about the Maui videos, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in an email: \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate they feel the need to lie. Instead, they should join him in supporting the people of Maui.\u201d The posts on the country\u2019s largest social media platforms, which largely appear to be spreading unchecked, are the latest test of how Silicon Valley will handle misinformation in the 2024 election cycle \u2014 and whether it will enforce its own policies. Low-quality videos are an example of what some misinformation researchers call \u201c\u201d: media that can mislead people through simple techniques, ... [Content truncated]",

In March 2020, Twitter applied its \u201cmanipulated media\u201d label for the first time to a deceptively edited video of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden that was posted by Scavino and retweeted by President Trump. The video was cut short to make it sound as though Biden inadvertently endorsed Trump for reelection. On Sunday, Scavino shared another altered video targeting Biden. Let\u2019s dig in. Scavino tweeted a manipulated video from his personal account that makes it look like Biden fell asleep during a TV interview. The video spliced together two different clips \u2014 one from a 2011 KBAK interview with actor Harry Belafonte and the other of Biden at a virtual town hall event with Hillary Clinton in April 2020. The video has a photoshopped chyron that reads \u201cOn air: Joe Biden | The importance of this election.\u201d A soundtrack of snoring has been added. It has a look of authenticity, but close observers might have been confused when, at one point in the short clip, anchor Leyla Santiago says, \u201cThis is your wake up call, Harry,\u201d referring to Belafonte. Belafonte, in a response to the New York Times, said the original video flub was due to a technical glitch, and he criticized the fake video. Harry Belafonte on the manipulated video featuring him tweeted by Scavino, a dep WH chief of staff: \u201cThey keep stooping lower and lower. A technical glitch in an interview I did 9 years ago now becomes another one of their lies, more of their fake news...\u201d 1/ Twitter marked the content as \u201cmanipulated media,\u201d and the video was disabled on the platform \u201cin response to a report by the copyright holder.\u201d ...

The synthetic images that emerged were often crude, unconvincing and costly to produce, especially when other kinds of misinformation were so inexpensive and easy to spread on social media. The threat posed by AI and so-called deepfakes always seemed a year or two away. No more. Sophisticated generative AI tools can now create cloned human voices and hyper-realistic images, videos and audio in seconds, at minimal cost. When strapped to powerful social media algorithms, this fake and digitally created content can spread far and fast and target highly specific audiences, potentially taking campaign dirty tricks to a new low. The implications for the 2024 campaigns and elections are as large as they are troubling: Generative AI can not only rapidly produce targeted campaign emails, texts or videos, it also could be used to mislead voters, impersonate candidates and undermine elections on a scale and at a speed not yet seen. WATCH: Security expert warns of AI tools\u2019 potential threat to democracy \u201cWe\u2019re not prepared for this,\u201d warned A.J. Nash, vice president of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm ZeroFox. \u201dTo me, the big leap forward is the audio and video capabilities that have emerged. When you can do that on a large scale, and distribute it on social platforms, well, it\u2019s going to have a major impact.\u201d AI experts can quickly rattle off a number of alarming scenarios in which generative AI is used to create synthetic media for the ...
