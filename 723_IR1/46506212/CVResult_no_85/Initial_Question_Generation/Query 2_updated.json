It does resemble the images and videos on the club's official website, and it is\u2014or at least was\u2014a very popular hotspot, yet, it remains unclear when the video may have actually been filmed. The club's Facebook page hasn't been updated since 2018 and no videos have been posted to its YouTube page since July of 2021\u2014more than six months before Russia launched its unprovoked invasion.

A few months into 2022, after the Russian withdrawal from Kyiv, clubs and bars began reopening, creating a semblance of normalcy.

Ever since the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, in the capital city Kyiv has faced major upheavals. At the same time, parts of the region had begun returning to normalcy by early 2023. A number of videos shared on social media in May 2023 claimed to show Kyiv residents dancing and partying late at night in various clubs and bars, with users questioning whether funds should be going to support Ukraine's war effort when things appeared to be so normal. For example, Twitter user @RadioGeneva wrote, \"Meanwhile in Kiev nightclubs\u2026Please donate more money!\" in a tweet that included a number of clips showing people dancing and partying in both indoor and outdoor nightclubs. Our preliminary searches found all of the clips had been posted on the TikTok account @kievnight, which claimed to show \"Only Kiev Night Life.\" We confirmed that at least one of the clips @RadioGeneva shared, was actually posted by @kievnight in December 2021, months before the Russian invasion of Ukraine began.

The Fact-Checked Disinformation Detected In The EU The Fact-Checked Disinformation Detected In The EU WAR IN UKRAINE The Fact-Checked Disinformation Detected In The EU -------------------------------------------------- European fact-checkers focused a lot of their efforts in the past days and weeks in detecting and tackling disinformation concerning the situation in Ukraine. At the beginning of the year, as the crisis was growing in intensity, the spread of false news about Ukraine detected in the EU was still very small. Fact-checkers detected a growth in the first half of February, even if the qualitative and quantitative levels of the disinformation was not alarmingly high. After the military actions against the whole Ukraine started in the morning of 24 February, though, fact-checkers witnessed the situation changing substantially and the disinformation about the events growing both in quantity and dangerousness. ### Periodic Insights And Early Warnings: Disinformation Narratives About The War In Ukraine EDMO publishes regular insights highlighting the main disinformation trends related to the war in Ukraine.

Ron DeSantis in the center of the stage \u2013 and he was the central figure for much of the night. And because he has positioned himself as a defender of Trump, Ramaswamy was, at times, a stand-in for the former president, who momentarily ceded the stage Wednesday night but will take it back Thursday when he turns himself in at the Fulton County jail in Georgia as he faces election subversion charges. Ron DeSantis set the expectation that he would be the focal point of Wednesday\u2019s debate. He was anything but. He certainly didn\u2019t speak the most. Though his campaign suggested his Republican opponents would have their \u201cknives out\u201d for DeSantis, he wasn\u2019t on the receiving end of many attacks. And at a key moment \u2013 when the candidates were asked to raise their hands if they would support Trump if he is convicted in a court of law \u2013 DeSantis peeked around the stage to see how everyone else had responded before he half heartedly put up his right palm. When moderators asked DeSantis whether Pence was right to reject Trump\u2019s pressure campaign to overturn the 2020 presidential election, the Florida governor attempted to dodge \u2013 ignoring what he\u2019d been asked and complaining about the \u201cweaponization\u201d of the federal government. But Pence dug in, putting DeSantis on the spot. \u201cThe American people deserve to know whether everyone on this stage agrees that I kept my oath to the Constitution that day. There\u2019s no more important duty, so answer the question,\u201d he said. \u201cMike did his duty. ... [Content truncated]",
