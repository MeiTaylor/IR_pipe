In Odesa six beaches were officially opened for swimming - for the first time since the start of a full-scale war. (смысловой повтор текста). However, people also continue to swim on the other beaches of the city, where swimming is prohibited. (Photo by Viacheslav Onyshchenko/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images) A number of videos featuring bikini-clad women made the rounds on Twitter this weekend, but not for the reasons some might expect. The clips purported to show a beach on the Black Sea near the Ukrainian city of Odesa after it reportedly reopened for the first time since Russia's invasion. The post was met with a backlash as those critical of U.S. and other Western aid being provided to Ukraine voiced their frustration that it didn't resemble a warzone. However, other users on Twitter soon weighed in that the video was actually filmed at the Strandbad Plötzensee, a lake in the city of Berlin, Germany! Another video also circulated showing a party-like gathering at the Ibiza Beach Club in Odesa. It does resemble the images and videos on the club's official website, and it is—or at least was—a very popular hotspot, yet, it remains unclear when the video may have actually been filmed. The club's Facebook page hasn't been updated since 2018 and no videos have been posted to its YouTube page since July of 2021—more than six months before Russia launched its unprovoked invasion. It would appear that the Ibiza Beach Club in Odesa may still be closed. However, there is a grain of truth to the story. As Reuters reported on ... [Content truncated]",

Context Some of the videos in question were posted before the war, while the timing of others remain uncertain. Regardless, Kyiv has been under various levels of curfew ever since the war began, impacting nightlife in the city. A few months into 2022, after the Russian withdrawal from Kyiv, clubs and bars began reopening, creating a semblance of normalcy. In March 2023, curfew was relaxed to midnight allowing clubs and bars to remain open for longer. Ever since the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, in the capital city Kyiv has faced major upheavals. At the same time, parts of the region had begun returning to normalcy by early 2023. A number of videos shared on social media in May 2023 claimed to show Kyiv residents dancing and partying late at night in various clubs and bars, with users questioning whether funds should be going to support Ukraine's war effort when things appeared to be so normal. For example, Twitter user @RadioGeneva wrote, \"Meanwhile in Kiev nightclubs…Please donate more money!\" in a tweet that included a number of clips showing people dancing and partying in both indoor and outdoor nightclubs. Our preliminary searches found all of the clips had been posted on the TikTok account @kievnight, which claimed to show \"Only Kiev Night Life.\" We confirmed that at least one of the clips @RadioGeneva shared, was actually posted by @kievnight in December 2021, months before the Russian invasion of Ukraine began.

The Fact-Checked Disinformation Detected In The EU The Fact-Checked Disinformation Detected In The EU WAR IN UKRAINE The Fact-Checked Disinformation Detected In The EU -------------------------------------------------- European fact-checkers focused a lot of their efforts in the past days and weeks in detecting and tackling disinformation concerning the situation in Ukraine. At the beginning of the year, as the crisis was growing in intensity, the spread of false news about Ukraine detected in the EU was still very small. Fact-checkers detected a growth in the first half of February, even if the qualitative and quantitative levels of the disinformation was not alarmingly high. After the military actions against the whole Ukraine started in the morning of 24 February, though, fact-checkers witnessed the situation changing substantially and the disinformation about the events growing both in quantity and dangerousness. ### Periodic Insights And Early Warnings: Disinformation Narratives About The War In Ukraine EDMO publishes regular insights highlighting the main disinformation trends related to the war in Ukraine.
