This belief and the limited impact the war in Ukraine has had on the day-to-day lives of most Russians go some way to explaining continuing high levels of support for the war among Russians. In the nearly two years since Russia launched its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d against Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Russian society has gotten used to living against the backdrop of a brutal armed conflict.

There are also those known as \u201cturbo-patriots,\u201d who earnestly and aggressively support Putin. But the vast majority is apathetic, and simply passively and automatically \u201cmostly supports\u201d what the regime is doing while waiting for \u201call this\u201d to end. This part ...

Although attacks on energy infrastructure that had driven needs during the winter months decreased towards February, homes, schools, water systems and hospitals continued to be attacked in the following months. From March to June, fighting intensified in front-line communities of Donetska Oblast, making humanitarian assistance increasingly difficult to provide in an area where needs are acute. In the south, attacks on port and grain infrastructure since the termination of the Black Sea Initiative in July created additional challenges for agricultural exports from Ukraine. This further impacted farmers already struggling due the heavy land mine contamination, particularly concerning in the Ukraine\u2019s breadbasket regions, including Kharkivska, Khersonska and Mykolaivska oblasts. Intensified hostilities in Kharkivska, Zaporizka and Sumska oblasts in recent months forced thousands from their homes, in a country where over 5.1 million people are currently internally displaced. In Kharkivska oblast, hundreds of people fled Kupianskyi Raion in August alone. Attacks have also increased in areas further from the front line during the same period, causing damages to homes, schools, and hospitals and impacting parts of the country where millions of people have sought safety and refuge after being uprooted from front-line communities. Massive destruction has further impacted essential services already decimated by the war, including access to education, health services and water. The impact on children by the damages to schools, displacement and traumatic experiences negatively affects their well being and education. According to the Government, only 30 per cent of the 3 million school-aged children in Ukraine are in full-time face-to-face learning, while nearly 40 per cent can only attend education online and another 30 per cent a ...
