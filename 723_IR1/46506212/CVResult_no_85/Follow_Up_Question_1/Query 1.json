Attacks continued to result in civilian deaths, injuries and displacement.** Civilian infrastructure was severely impacted, affecting livelihoods and compounding people's vulnerability. Civilian casualties significantly increased, mainly as a result of a ground offensive launched by the Russian Armed Forces in Kharkivska Oblast, which caused over half of the civilian casualties recorded in May. According to the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU), 703 civilians were killed or injured in 2024, rising to 864 ... [Content truncated]",

This is an even greater number than the displacement of Syrians or Ukrainians outside of their countries. Despite these numbers, the Venezuelan migrant and refugee crisis, quite unfortunately, has climbed down the list of political and policy priorities, with fewer headlines in the media and sporadic policy conversations in Washington. On one hand, there is a sense that this is the new normal for the region and that host countries in Latin America and the Caribbean will have to continue to manage the influx of 6.4 million Venezuelans and counting as best as they can. On the other hand, it seems that neighboring countries across the region are willing to continue discussions on how best to address migration and forced displacement, but by removing the Venezuelan political focus from the center of the migrant and refugee discussion. The truth is, however, that this is a crisis that persists, and is likely to continue as long as the root causes are not addressed. The efforts from the region to respond have been commendable thus far. They have varied but have generally followed a spirit of regional solidarity as well as pragmatism in the wake of large-scale Venezuelan inflows. Important regional innovations have also characterized this recent period. Receiving countries in the Americas have extended options to displaced Venezuelans to regularize their status (often with financial support and encouragement from the United States), and other policies have also sought to ensure access to the labor market, health services, and basic education. Despite these efforts, the reality is that ... [Content truncated]",

Imagine leaving behind everything you know and trust, taking only what you can carry. Nearly 90 million people on earth understand exactly what that moment feels like. Most of them are refugees who have had to leave their country to find safety, food and jobs. The rest have fled their homes but haven’t made it past their country’s borders. They’re known as internally displaced persons (IDPs). Refugees and IDPs face some of the toughest challenges imaginable in their search for stability. One of the worst is hunger. Below are seven of the biggest and most devastating refugee crises in the world right now and what the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) is doing to help. The conflict in Syria reaches back to 2011 when the Arab Spring uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt inspired many Syrians to protest against their own country’s corruption and high unemployment rate. Staunch government opposition created further unrest and violence, giving way to a brutal war that has evolved into a long-term, complex civil conflict. The result is an economic crisis, rampant poverty and widespread displacement – all of which are driving millions of people into hunger. The Syrian refugee crisis remains the largest humanitarian and development crisis in the world. 6.8 million Syrians are internally displaced, and 5.3 million have been forced to seek safety as refugees in Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and beyond. Most Syrians who live in neighboring countries have few to no financial resources. In Lebanon for example, nine out of ten refugees now live in extreme poverty. Many share small, makeshift homes with other refugee families in overcrowded conditions. Within Syria, 12.1 million people are food insecure. The U.N. World Food Programme ... [Content truncated]",
