People in frontline and hard-to-reach areas urgently needed basic items for cooking, bedding, warmth and hygiene, and UNHCR contributed to 95 inter-agency humanitarian convoys to supply such items to over 575,000 people while shifting towards providing cash assistance rather than goods wherever possible. UNHCR also provided winterization assistance to over 900,000 people, including cash top-ups, relief items, and care in collective sites. Emergency shelter and sustainable housing support was provided to over 247,000 war-affected people, returnees and internally displaced people (IDPs), helping to repair damaged homes and infrastructure.

        "Question": "What are the humanitarian conditions in Ukraine beyond Kyiv compared to the beach party atmosphere?",
        "Answer": "The humanitarian conditions in Ukraine beyond Kyiv are severely challenging and starkly contrast with the leisurely beach party atmosphere depicted in the viral video. Here are several key points that illustrate the differences:\n\n1. **Displacement and Refugee Crisis**: Over 3.7 million people remain displaced within Ukraine, and approximately 6.3 million Ukrainians have fled as refugees and asylum-seekers due to the ongoing conflict. This massive displacement is indicative of the severe disruption and dangers faced by civilians amid the war.\n\n2. **Widespread Suffering and Human Rights Abuses**: The war has led to significant suffering among the civilian population, with reports of torture, summary executions, and other crimes against humanity committed by Russian forces. Many civilians have faced indiscriminate attacks on their homes and livelihoods, particularly in frontline regions where hostilities are persistent.\n\n3. **Damage to Infrastructure and Basic Services**: The conflict has severely damaged essential infrastructure, including energy, water, and heating services. Many civilians are left without access to these basic needs, particularly during harsh winter conditions, leading to heightened vulnerabilities among the population.\n\n4. **Dependence on Humanitarian Aid**: With millions dependent on humanitarian assistance due to the massive disruptions in the economy and social services caused by the war, agencies like UNHCR have worked to provide aid and support to displaced individuals. In 2023, UNHCR offered assistance to 2.6 million people, highlighting the critical need for ongoing support in the form of food, shelter, and protection services.\n\n5. **Psychosocial Impact**: The trauma and stress experienced by those living in conflict zones vastly differ from the carefree enjoyment of a beach party. The ongoing war has inflicted psychological wounds on many individuals and families, creating a need for psychological support and communal healing processes.\n\nIn summary, while the video captures a slice of life in Kyiv that appears normal, it fails to reflect the dire and urgent humanitarian crisis affecting many Ukrainians across the country. The realities of displacement, human rights violations, destroyed infrastructure, and dependence on relief efforts portray a very different picture from the beach party atmosphere seen in the video.",
