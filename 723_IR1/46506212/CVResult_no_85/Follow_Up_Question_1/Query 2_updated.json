Accountability for Apparent War Crimes, Other Abuses Crucial Share this via Facebook Share this via X Share this via WhatsApp Share this via Email Other ways to share Share this via LinkedIn Share this via Reddit Share this via Telegram Share this via Printer (Kyiv, January 12, 2023) \u2013 Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine has wrought a devastating toll on civilians and shattered civilian life in much of the country, Human Rights Watch said today in its World Report 2023. Russian forces have committed apparent war crimes and crimes against humanity, including torture, summary executions, and enforced disappearances. They have carried out indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas and repeatedly targeted energy infrastructure, leaving millions of civilians periodically without electricity, water, and heat as winter temperatures plunged. More than 14 million Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes. Information about Ukrainian forces violating the laws of war by mistreatment and apparent summary executions of prisoners of war, which would constitute a war crime, also emerged. \u201cThroughout the war, Russian forces have carried out horrific abuses in Ukraine with unconscionable disregard for civilian life,\u201d said Yulia Gorbunova, senior Ukraine researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cAccountability is crucial, both to bring justice to victims and survivors and to ensure that there is no impunity for these grave crimes.\u201d In the 712-page World Report 2023, its 33rd edition, Human Rights Watch reviews human rights practices in close to 100 countries. In her introductory essay, acting Executive Director Tirana Hassan says that in a world in which power has shifted, it is no longer possible to rely on a small group of mostly Global North governments to defend human rights.

In 2023, the Commission was replaced by the NATO-Ukraine Council, where Allies and Ukraine sit as equals. This change demonstrates the strengthening of political ties and Ukraine\u2019s increasing integration with NATO. * Cooperation has deepened over time and is mutually beneficial.

We\u2019re facing an inflection point in history \u2014 one of those moments where the decisions we make today are going to determine the future for decades to come. That\u2019s what I\u2019d like to talk with you about tonight. You know, earlier this morning, I returned from Israel. They tell me I\u2019m the first American president to travel there during a war. I met with the Prime Minister and members of his cabinet. And most movingly, I met with Israelis who had personally lived through horrific horror of the attack by Hamas on the 7th of October. More than 1,300 people slaughtered in Israel, including at least 32 American citizens. Scores of innocents \u2014 from infants to elderly grandparents, Israelis, Americans \u2014 taken hostage. As I told the families of Americans being held captive by Hamas, we\u2019re pursuing every avenue to bring their loved ones home. As President, there is no higher priority for me than the safety of Americans held hostage. The terrorist group Hamas unleashed pure, unadulterated evil in the world. But sadly, the Jewish people know, perhaps better than anyone, that there is no limit to the depravity of people when they want to inflict pain on others. In Israel, I saw a people who are strong, determined, resilient, and also angry, in shock, and in deep, deep pain. I also spoke with President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority and reiterated that the United States remains committed to the Palestinian people\u2019s right to dignity and to self-determination. The actions of Hamas terrorists don\u2019t take that right away. Like so many other, I am heartbroken by the tragic loss of Palestinian life, including the explosion at a hospital in Gaza \u2014 which was not done by the Israelis. We ... [Content truncated]",

In Ukraine, **UNHCR worked in complementarity with Government programmes**, providing urgent humanitarian assistance to 2.6 million people. 1.5 million of them received protection support such as legal assistance, information on rights and entitlements, psychosocial support, child protection services and support in relation to gender-based violence. UNHCR delivered cash assistance to nearly 900,000 vulnerable newly displaced people and returnees in 22 regions. People in frontline and hard-to-reach areas urgently needed basic items for cooking, bedding, warmth and hygiene, and UNHCR contributed to 95 inter-agency humanitarian convoys to supply such items to over 575,000 people while shifting towards providing cash assistance rather than goods wherever possible. UNHCR also provided winterization assistance to over 900,000 people, including cash top-ups, relief items, and care in collective sites. Emergency shelter and sustainable housing support was provided to over 247,000 war-affected people, returnees and internally displaced people (IDPs), helping to repair damaged homes and infrastructure.
