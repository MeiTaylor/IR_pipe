Some 5.3 million children face barriers preventing access to education, including 3.6 million children directly affected by school closures. This places children in Ukraine at risk of losing critical years of schooling and social development. Since February 2022, UNICEF has supported nearly 1.5 million of the most vulnerable children in Ukraine to access formal and non-formal education, including early learning. Since war began, over 2,600 schools have been damaged and over 400 destroyed across Ukraine, according to the Ministry of Education. Only approximately 25 per cent of Ukrainian schools nationwide have been able to offer full-time, in-person learning since September. In addition, UNICEF surveys show that fewer than a half of families with children under five-years-old were able to return to kindergarten and join educational activities. Damage to schools and power cuts following attacks on critical infrastructure have also hindered children’s ability to access education in-person and online, putting the future for millions of children at risk. “Every child must have access to quality and safe education, even amidst the war. Education is critical to children’s well-being and social development. It cannot be put on hold without risking the future of an entire generation.

This became part of Ukraine's national identity. At the beginning of the Russian aggression, many entertainment venues, such as cinemas, theaters, and nightclubs, stopped functioning.

        "Question": "What evidence exists to refute claims that a beach party in Kyiv signifies the absence of war in Ukraine?",
        "Answer": "The claims that a beach party in Kyiv signifies the absence of war in Ukraine can be refuted by a variety of evidence that underscores the ongoing and severe impacts of the conflict across the country. Here are several key points:\n\n1. **Humanitarian Crisis**: Approximately 5.3 million children in Ukraine are facing barriers to education due to the war, with significant portions of schools either damaged or unable to operate normally. This illustrates the broader humanitarian crisis affecting millions of Ukrainians, revealing a national context of distress that starkly contrasts with the carefree beach party atmosphere in Kyiv.\n\n2. **Displacement and Refugees**: The conflict has resulted in massive displacement. Millions of Ukrainians are either internally displaced or have fled the country as refugees. The ongoing humanitarian situation highlights that while some may temporarily enjoy leisure in specific, safer areas like Kyiv, many others are facing dire hardships elsewhere in the country.\n\n3. **Continued Conflict and Tensions**: Even in areas like Kyiv, which may appear relatively peaceful, the underlying tension and reality of ongoing conflict remain pervasive. Reports indicate that logistical and everyday activities are significantly impacted by the war, including fuel shortages due to airstrikes on key infrastructures, which creates a sense of instability.\n\nIn summary, while a beach party in Kyiv may suggest brief moments of normalcy, it is critical to recognize that this does not reflect the overall situation in Ukraine. Reports of displacement, educational disruption, and ongoing conflict contextualize the humanitarian crisis affecting many, undermining the notion that such localized leisure activities negate the existence of war.",
