Recent Reports -------------- 29 February 2024 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Yale School of Public Health\u2019s (YSPH) Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL), with research support from the Ukraine Digital Verification Lab (UDVL), has verified 66 incidents and identified 157 additional incidents of conflict-related damage to Ukraine\u2019s power generation and transmission infrastructure from 1 October 2022 to 30 April 2023. These 223 total incidents span 23 oblasts across Ukraine. The geospatial and temporal distributions of these incidents, in conjunction with statements on the attacks from public officials and state-sponsored media in Russia, appear consistent with a widespread and systematic effort to cripple vital power generation and transmission infrastructure across Ukraine. ! Map showing the geospatial distribution of identified incidents of damage to power generation and transmission infrastructure across Ukraine by oblast from 1 October 2022 to 30 April 2023. This map utilizes the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) Field Information Services Section subnational administrative boundary data. The naming conventions for oblasts, Crimea, and cities with special status are the short form \"Anglicized Variant\" (AV) names established by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names Geographic Names Server (GNS). Report: Executive Summary: 16 November 2023 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Belarus and Russia are conducting a joint effort to deport children from Russia-occupied Ukraine through Russia to Belarus. This operation is conducted at the highest levels of Belarus\u2019 regime and Russia\u2019s federal government and facilitated by various pro-Russia and pro-regime organizations. Russia and Belarus have jointly identified children for deportation from Ukraine, coordinated their transport from occupied Ukraine to Russia and onward to Belarus, and subjected children to re-education, including military training. !

This research brief sets out key data and research findings on trafficking and smuggling risks related to the war in Ukraine, in order to better understand and prevent these crimes, and protect victims of trafficking and other abuses. This version, dated December 2022, is the second update of the original version, taking account of data and findings that have emerged since March 2022. Data are valid as of 22 December 2022. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) is currently conducting research in European countries among people who fled Ukraine, with the findings due for publication in mid-2023. \uf0f0 THE CONFLICT MAKES PEOPLE VULNERABLE TO TRAFFICKING INSIDE UKRAINE UNODC research shows that inside an affected country, vulnerabilities to trafficking in persons arise from the impacts of conflict: lack of income-generation opportunities; interruption in the provision of essential services; issues with rule of law; internal displacement; and the risk of exploitation in armed conflict. People living in conflict zones may adopt negative coping strategies to gain access to food and other supplies, or for their own safety and security. 1 The number of verified civilian casualties since the outbreak of the war has reached 17,595, > 1All websites accessed 22.12.2022.

In the nearly two years since Russia launched its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d against Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Russian society has gotten used to living against the backdrop of a brutal armed conflict. A significant part of the population has reconciled itself to the idea that they will be living under the current state of affairs for quite some time, and that they must therefore adjust to reality, which ordinary Russians are in any case unable\u2014and often unwilling\u2014to change. All the na\u00efve predictions that popular discontent triggered by sanctions and the wartime restrictions imposed on daily life would bring down Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime have come to nothing. In many ways, quite the opposite has happened. Most Russians might not identify with the regime, but they have consolidated around the Kremlin, which they believe to be fighting tooth and nail against a West that is seeking to destroy Russia. Despite the fact that such a depiction is at odds with reality, a great many Russians have accepted it as the most logical explanation for this protracted nightmare. Naturally, some Russians are unhappy with the situation. Millions of people are opposed to authoritarianism and bloodshed, and some of them openly express their views and resist. There are also those known as \u201cturbo-patriots,\u201d who earnestly and aggressively support Putin. But the vast majority is apathetic, and simply passively and automatically \u201cmostly supports\u201d what the regime is doing while waiting for \u201call this\u201d to end. This part ...

TPS is a temporary benefit that does not lead to lawful permanent resident status or give any other immigration status. However, registration for TPS does not prevent you from: * Applying for nonimmigrant status * Filing for adjustment of status based on an immigrant petition * Applying for any other immigration benefit or protection for which you may be eligible PLEASE NOTE: To be granted any other immigration benefit you must still meet all the eligibility requirements for that particular benefit.
