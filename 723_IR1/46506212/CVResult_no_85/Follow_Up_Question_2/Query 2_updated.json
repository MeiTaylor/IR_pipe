Some 5.3 million children face barriers preventing access to education, including 3.6 million children directly affected by school closures. This places children in Ukraine at risk of losing critical years of schooling and social development. Since February 2022, UNICEF has supported nearly 1.5 million of the most vulnerable children in Ukraine to access formal and non-formal education, including early learning. Since war began, over 2,600 schools have been damaged and over 400 destroyed across Ukraine, according to the Ministry of Education. Only approximately 25 per cent of Ukrainian schools nationwide have been able to offer full-time, in-person learning since September. In addition, UNICEF surveys show that fewer than a half of families with children under five-years-old were able to return to kindergarten and join educational activities. Damage to schools and power cuts following attacks on critical infrastructure have also hindered children\u2019s ability to access education in-person and online, putting the future for millions of children at risk. \u201cEvery child must have access to quality and safe education, even amidst the war. Education is critical to children\u2019s well-being and social development. It cannot be put on hold without risking the future of an entire generation. Lives of millions will be infinitely harder if we fail to help them continue their education now,\u201d emphasized UNICEF Ukraine Representative Murat Sahin. Beyond education, schools also play a critical role in the social development of children, which is critical for managing the psychosocial stressors and traumas that war brings.

Most of them\u20147,200 Ukrainian civilians killed, 8 million forced to flee abroad, a global hunger crisis driven by surging food prices\u2014paint an unremittingly tragic picture, for both Ukraine and the world. For the climate though, it\u2019s a little different. Twelve months in, the war\u2019s decidedly mixed carbon impact is coming into view. Inside Ukraine, experts have tracked vast amounts of the greenhouse gasses that have been unleashed by Vladimir Putin\u2019s path of destruction. Outside of Ukraine, though, the opposite has happened. To many analysts\u2019 surprise, Putin\u2019s decision to squeeze gas exports to Europe last summer has pushed the region\u2019s emissions down in recent months. It has also accelerated a global phase out of fossil fuels: just ask British oil major BP, which in January revised its pre-invasion estimates to predict a much sharper decline in demand for fossil fuels in 2035, citing countries\u2019 post-war belief that renewables provide better energy security. But let\u2019s look at the bad climate news first. Forest fires sparked by fighting, attacks on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines, the need to rebuild hundreds of thousands of blasted buildings, plus the millions of fossil-fueled journeys by soldiers, munitions, and refugees, adds up to a lot of extra carbon pollution. Russia\u2019s targeting of Ukraine\u2019s energy system, starting in October, has been particularly damaging: as oil depots and gas power plants have exploded, releasing carbon and methane into the air, Ukrainians have been forced to rely on dirtier fuels to keep warm. \u201cWe saw a huge influx of inefficient [diesel-powered] generators in November and December,\u201d says Lennard de Klerk, a Dutch carbon accounting expert in Kyiv preparing a report on the war\u2019s ...

My mother had won a green card in the U.S. immigration lottery, happy to escape the turbulence of the 1990s, but I liked my life in Moscow and dreamed of witnessing my country coming into its own. It shouldn\u2019t be hard to feel deep sympathy for Ukraine without becoming indiscriminately anti-Russian. Though half of my family lived in Ukraine, I identified as Russian \u2014 even more so once I became an immigrant. Being Russian distinguished me not only from the American kids at school, but also from other immigrants from the former USSR. Most of them came at a younger age and no longer spoke their mother tongue, whereas I planned to hold on to the Russian language as long as I could. At 15, I even started a national magazine in Russian to try to inspire love for the language among my peers. In 2012, I finally moved back to Moscow. A wave of protests against Vladimir Putin was grabbing headlines around the world, and I felt like it was the right time to return to Russia as it became more democratic. But what I found there disillusioned me. Once I saw the protests with my own eyes, I grew pessimistic that they would succeed in bringing any change. It was as if the protesters came out to be heard without believing anyone in the Kremlin would actually listen. Overall, people seemed either exhausted by a hard life in a huge, fast metropolis or spoiled by their recent financial gains and indifferent to political change. I also had a difficult time relating to Russians. I didn\u2019t know the ins and outs of their politics, just ... [Content truncated]",

Some of the country's residents have completely forgotten the last time they went to the theater or a concert. We are going to tell you how the culture and entertainment industry in Ukraine works during the war. **How has show business in Ukraine been affected by the russian invasion?** --------------------------------------------------------------------------- It's worth noting that the full-scale war has led to an increase in patriotic sentiment in society. This affected the work of Ukrainian artists, musicians and writers. They began to create works dedicated to the defense of the homeland, the heroism of the military and the victims of the war. This became part of Ukraine's national identity. At the beginning of the Russian aggression, many entertainment venues, such as cinemas, theaters, and nightclubs, stopped functioning. The streets of the cities were engulfed in silence and fear. Leaving the house, one could see a few working shops and coffee shops. A few months later, the culture and entertainment industry began to recover from the \"blow\" that could not ... [Content truncated]",

Still, we are shocked and almost broken by this one. It's louder, more violent, and more meaningless; and the level of horror we are experiencing in our village and witnessing in cities and towns like Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Bucha, and others is so much greater. The longer this drags on, the more people will die, and those who remain alive will grow angrier and more vengeful. My struggle in this war is about keeping my humanity, even my sanity, and writing this diary is part of that effort. When looking at the illustrations published here, I was very critical of the quality of my work. I told myself that if it wasn\u2019t for the war and the emotional pressure, I would have produced something better, cleaner. But looking at them now, I realise they reflect what I am feeling. The photos are from places in Ukraine that I visited during the past several years. A lot of these places have now been bombed or shelled. The drawings done over the photographs represent the new reality that didn\u2019t exist when these photos were taken. I dream that one day I will visit these spots again without fearing bombs, forced deportation to Russia, or death. How I witnessed the war begin ----------------------------- 24 February 2022 ! I sit at 3am in front of my multi-screen computer set-up, watching several live feeds: a camera near Kharkiv; a broadcast from inside Kyiv; and a couple of news channels. The days leading up to the war have been stressful. Being a news junkie, I've been following the build-up in minute detail, checking every video of military equipment and personnel being moved ...

Roughly speaking there are two main camps. Realists and progressives blame Russia\u2019s invasion principally, sometimes solely, on NATO expansion\u2014a needless, provocative policy that, as they see it, posed an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to Russia. Neoconservatives and many liberal internationalists, despite their political differences on other fronts, deny that NATO expansion had this effect, and even claim that it was wholly irrelevant to Putin\u2019s decision to attack Ukraine. Instead, they see Putin\u2019s ingrained imperial instincts and fear of a democratic Ukraine as the root cause of the war. On February 24, 2022, there was no chance that Ukraine would enter NATO any time soon, if ever. The trouble with this impasse is that each camp makes blame for the war an all or nothing affair. After a year of enormous violence and destruction, we need a far more nuanced understanding of the war\u2014its causes, how it might be ended, and the challenges that will remain once it is over. * * * **What Caused the War?** Start with the causes. There is a third way between the stylized contrast with which I began. This view acknowledges that NATO expansion poisoned the well for U.S.-Russia relations and that Russia understandably saw it (well before Putin came on the scene\u2014indeed, as far back as the early 1990s, as recently demonstrate) as a hostile move, even a threatening one, which Russian leaders also regarded as unnecessary. Expanding a Cold War alliance to Russia\u2019s border was not the best nor the only way to build a post\u2013Cold War security architecture in Europe\u2014a case I made at length last March. The third view of the war, however, introduces a critical caveat: on February 24 last ... [Content truncated]",
