Pete Kiehart for NPR hide caption People ice skate at a Christmas market at VDNG, the Expocenter of Ukraine, in Kyiv on Dec. 3. Since Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, the country has been in a state of flux. Ukrainians have had to recalibrate their idea of what normal is monthly, weekly, daily \u2014 or even hourly. In the winter days immediately following the invasion, with a Russian column of armor and soldiers stalled less than 20 miles from the center of the capital Kyiv, \"normal\" meant a ghost town.
