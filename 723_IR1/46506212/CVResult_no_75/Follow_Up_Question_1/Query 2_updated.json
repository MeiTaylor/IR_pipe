Andriy Pyshnyy, Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), spoke to Country Focus in Washington about the economic impact of Russia\u2019s invasion, the challenges of maintaining banking and financial stability at a time of war, his expectations for the IMF monitoring program, moves to revive local debt markets and relax crisis controls, and how impaired hearing has affected him. Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine, Andriy Pyshnyy and IMF Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva. (Photo credit: IMF Photos/Joshua Philip Roberts) It has been almost 10 months since Russia invaded Ukraine. What has been the impact on Ukraine\u2019s economy and how has society remained resilient? For the past 10 months, Ukraine has withstood the largest full-scale military aggression in Europe since World War II. Ukrainians have demonstrated fantastic resilience. The impact of the war is hard even to comprehend. According to our estimates, Ukraine will lose at least one-third of its GDP in 2022. During the first few weeks, the war was practically everywhere, either through active ground operations or air strikes. It was a very hard period. ... [Content truncated]",

We\u2019re facing an inflection point in history \u2014 one of those moments where the decisions we make today are going to determine the future for decades to come. That\u2019s what I\u2019d like to talk with you about tonight. You know, earlier this morning, I returned from Israel. They tell me I\u2019m the first American president to travel there during a war. I met with the Prime Minister and members of his cabinet. And most movingly, I met with Israelis who had personally lived through horrific horror of the attack by Hamas on the 7th of October. More than 1,300 people slaughtered in Israel, including at least 32 American citizens. Scores of innocents \u2014 from infants to elderly grandparents, Israelis, Americans \u2014 taken hostage. As I told the families of Americans being held captive by Hamas, we\u2019re pursuing every avenue to bring their loved ones home. As President, there is no higher priority for me than the safety of Americans held hostage. The terrorist group Hamas unleashed pure, unadulterated evil in the world. But sadly, the Jewish people know, perhaps better than anyone, that there is no limit to the depravity of people when they want to inflict pain on others. In Israel, I saw a people who are strong, determined, resilient, and also angry, in shock, and in deep, deep pain. I also spoke with President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority and reiterated that the United States remains committed to the Palestinian people\u2019s right to dignity and to self-determination. The actions of Hamas terrorists don\u2019t take that right away. Like so many other, I am heartbroken by the tragic loss of Palestinian life, including the explosion at a hospital in Gaza \u2014 which was not done by the Israelis. We ... [Content truncated]",

In May and June, more than 200 Russian projectiles were shot down over the capital region, Ukrainian officials said. With the relentless pace of attacks, a full night of sound slumber is something to dream about \u2014 a rare treat, a treasure so often tantalizingly out of reach. Kyiv, which resisted Russia\u2019s early onslaught of ground forces, is hundreds of miles from the current front lines, and people here tend to depict their own forced wakefulness as a far lesser ordeal than the battlefield conditions faced by the country\u2019s defenders or the perils of life in Russian-occupied cities and towns. But the noisy alerts reflect real danger. On a Saturday in June, five people were killed when falling debris from an intercepted missile hit a multistory building in Kyiv, incinerating parts of two floors and sending chunks of masonry plummeting into stairwells and the courtyard. Closer to the front lines, civilians as well as soldiers are at constant risk. On June 27, Russian Iskander missiles struck a popular restaurant in the eastern city of Kramatorsk at the dinner hour, resulting in the deaths of at least 13 people, including four children and a prominent young Ukrainian novelist. Dozens of others were injured. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to dwell on it all the time, the possibility of a missile coming for you,\u201d said Larisa Lapshina, a 65-year-old ... [Content truncated]",

There was no logic anymore.\u201d During the last weeks, we have not seen the same chaos, have not felt the same fear, have not experienced the uncertainty of the first days of the full-scale invasion.

I remember the reports about massive missile strikes all over Ukraine trying to knock down anti-missile defense systems. I remember the 40-mile-long column of Russian tanks heading to Kyiv, threatening untold loss of life and making the chances for survival of the Ukrainian people close to nothing. I remember my shock and the sense that I was incapable of processing the immense emotions that seized my psyche. The experience of war is overwhelming. It is bigger than what one could ordinarily handle and extremely difficult to describe with words that truthfully reflect its horrible reality. Such difficulty comes not only from war\u2019s perverse character, which defies human imagination but also from the acute awareness that such things require an immediate lived experience. War cannot be fully experienced from a distance. Did you ever have to explain a joke to a person who did not know the specific cultural, political, or linguistic reference used in its context? Afterward, you probably felt uneasy because you wanted to share something very witty with someone you assumed would get it. The unwritten rule of humor is that by explaining a joke, you not only take away its charm, but you kill it entirely. Either you understand or you do not; \u201cIf you get it, you get it.\u201d This analogy is far from perfect. The war is not a joke. The war is a human tragedy. But similarly to a joke, war requires a personal reference point and experience to be understood and articulated. \"Words\" by Kateryna Kosianenko. Used with permission.

NATO has signed a large ammunition deal that it says would help it supply Ukraine with desperately needed stocks. The military alliance announced on Tuesday that it has signed a deal worth 1.1 billion euros ($1.2bn) to buy artillery shells. The move comes amid intensified exchanges of fire between Russia and Ukraine since the end of last year, which have depleted the latter\u2019s weapons stockpiles. NATO greenlit the purchase of 220,000 rounds of 155mm ammunition, the most widely sought-after artillery shell, noting that bulk buying for member states should ensure lower prices.

According to European Union estimates, Ukraine was firing approximately 4,000 to 7,000 artillery shells each day last summer, while Russia was launching more than 20,000 shells daily in its neighbour\u2019s territory. Drawing on its deep stockpiles, Russia has in recent weeks concentrated on air raids in a bid to drain Ukraine\u2019s air defence systems. Officials in Kyiv say Russia launched 500 ...
