Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that a review of military medical commissions is underway following revelations that some had accepted bribes to help Ukrainians evade conscription. During his nightly address on Wednesday, Zelensky said that “the inspection of military medical commissions across the country is underway.” Thousands of military-aged men have avoided conscription and fled abroad since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 with the help of bribes and “unreasonable decisions” by military medical commissions, the president said. On Tuesday, the Security Service of Ukraine reported that an investigation is underway into the head of the military medical commission in Kyiv region who is suspected of allowing over 50 men of enlistment age to evade the draft in exchange for bribes on the basis of fictitious documents about “bad” health. According to the security service, the head of the military medical commission and five others were a part of the criminal scheme that helped men who wanted to evade the draft and flee abroad. Zelensky said all of those who accepted bribes would be brought to justice. “It is necessary to check a significant number of decisions of the military medical commissions on disability and unfitness for military service that were made after February 24,” Zelensky said, adding that “there are examples of regions where the number of people removed from the military register due to the MMC’s (military medical commissions) decision has increased tenfold since February last year.”“It is absolutely clear what these decisions are corrupt decisions,” Zelensky emphasized. Zelensky noted that “the criminal proceedings are currently underway” against the staff of military medical commissions and medical social expert commissions of Ukraine. “The list of those who went abroad due to obviously dubious ...

                "content": "Recent gains by Ukrainian troops on the southern front could open the way for pushing the Russians back to the annexed Crimean peninsula, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said. He said this became possible after Kyiv liberated the \"strategically important\" village of Robotyne in the Zaporizhzhia region. Russia's military says its forces are still holding on to the village. Ukraine seeks to cut the land corridor to Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014. By doing so, Kyiv would split in two the land Russia occupies in southern Ukraine, making Moscow's supply lines more complicated. The latest claims by both Ukraine and Russia have not been independently verified. Speaking at a recent meeting of French ambassadors in Paris, Mr Kuleba said: \"Having entrenched on its [Robotyne's] flanks, we are opening the way to Tokmak and, eventually, Melitopol and the administrative border with Crimea.\" The Russian-occupied cities of Tokmak and Melitopol are key military and logistical hubs for Russia. Mr Kuleba stressed that Ukraine's counter-offensive - launched in early June - was continuing, but admitted it was an \"extremely difficult\" task. \"The number of minefields and fortifications is unprecedented. Russian drones, helicopters and planes dominate the air. But we are gradually succeeding.\" He described how one group of 31 Ukrainian fighters had \"literally crawled on their stomachs through kilometres of minefields\", eventually making it possible for a brigade to retake Robotyne. In its Wednesday's report on the battlefield situation, Ukraine's military also said its forces \"had success\" in the direction to the south and south-east of Robotyne. But Russia's military said it troops had \"repelled nine attacks\" by Ukrainian forces in the Robotyne area, as well as around the Verbove village to the south-east.

At least five people were killed, including three children, in a Ukrainian attack on Crimea on Sunday, according to the Russian defence ministry, which said the supply of missiles made the United States responsible for the attack. One person was also killed and ten others wounded by Russian strikes on Ukraine’s eastern city of Kharkiv, regional governor Oleh Synehubov said. The Ukrainian attack on the Russian-occupied Crimean peninsula was conducted with five US-supplied Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles, the Russian defence ministry said. It added that four had been shot down, and that a fifth had detonated in mid-air. The ministry claimed that US specialists had set the missiles’ flight coordinates on the basis of information from US spy satellites. There has been no response from the US, which began supplying Ukraine with the missiles earlier this year. Footage aired on Russian state television showed people running from a beach and some people being carried off sun loungers. Authorities in Crimea said missile fragments had fallen near a beach on the north side of the city of Sevastopol. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, though most of the world still considers the territory part of Ukraine. Separately, in the Belgorod region, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram that one person was killed and three wounded after Ukrainian drones hit the Russian town of Graivoron.
