You know how sports memorabilia stores sometimes sell basketballs autographed by an entire N.B.A. team? Well, I was imagining that Donald Trump could sell white flags at $1,000 a pop that say, \u201cWe surrendered Ukraine to Russia,\u201d autographed by him and the House and Senate MAGA sycophants he\u2019s assembled to deny Ukrainians the weapons they need to stave off Vladimir Putin\u2019s onslaught. For an extra $500, you could get a white flag autographed solely by Trump and J.D. Vance and emblazoned with Vance\u2019s immortal words, \u201cI don\u2019t really care what happens to Ukraine.\u201d Or one signed by House Speaker Mike Johnson, big enough to sum up his worldview: I was for Ukraine aid until I was against it, but I could be for it again if Trump is not against it. This is a matter of principle for me. Either way, it\u2019s all Biden\u2019s fault. And then the ultimate collector\u2019s item. For an extra $1,000, a giant white surrender flag, made from the softest Sea Island cotton, signed by Lindsey Graham, that says: \u201cI gave up the principles of John McCain and a free Ukraine because Trump told me to. But I got a round of golf at Trump\u2019s West Palm Beach course. Can I still be on \u2018Meet the Press\u2019?\u201d The last gift comes with a pair of Trump\u2019s new branded tennis shoes, guaranteed by Trump and personally tested by Graham, to be the fastest shoe on the market to run away from any ally or foe \u2014 or anything principled that you\u2019ve ever said. The possibilities are endless, because Trump\u2019s G.O.P. has become bottomless. It now manifests an infinite willingness to engage in any form of ... [Content truncated]",
