Coverage of the Israel-Hamas war has been constant since the start of the conflict on October 7. What have you observed about how US media outlets are approaching this conflict? How does this compare to how news outlets based outside of the US are covering the war? Hamas’ horrific October 7 attack on Israel made headlines for several days, and the media still covers personal stories about individual hostages. However, the attack and Hamas’s nature as a terrorist group have been eclipsed by coverage of Palestinian causalities suffered in Gaza, as they are more current, far greater in numbers, and are captured in daily videos on television. The conflict has been cruel and tragic to everyone, but US media is often crisis-oriented and covers the war as a “play by play,” as opposed to presenting a broader picture of the impact of the conflict. American coverage of the military campaign tends to lean towards the Israeli and American governments’ narratives, sometimes at the expense of adequately representing Palestinian viewpoints. The number of Palestinian causalities is often reported with a caveat that numbers come from the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, as if to cast doubt on their legitimacy.

Media coverage of conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) focuses on female victims of sexual and gender-based violence, drawing on narrow depictions and gender stereotypes to provoke empathy and horror, galvanising calls for action. However, they provide an incomplete picture of the everyday experiences of war and conflict, reinforcing the narrative that sexual violence in conflict is a crime committed by men against women. Although international organisations and the academic community are aware of the diversity of experiences of those victimised by CRSV, this has not been translated into media coverage. Media representations and social norms The media portrayal of conflict-related sexual violence can shape public perceptions, social norms and attitudes. In some cases it can supersede normal institutions of policy making. With this is mind, the media is essential to changing narratives, discourses and the way in which we conceptualise facts. It socially constructs reality, shaping and reproducing norms about gender and sexuality. We construct our reality based on our observations and experiences; the media presents us with many of those experiences, observations, interpretations and attitudes. The widespread access to information disseminated by the media has the potential to impact a broad range of attitudes and behaviours. For example, a study in partnership with UNESCO conducted in Quialana, Mexico of a radio programme intervention designed to challenge gender roles, attitudes and norms around violence against women found that the social mechanism, that is information disseminated publicly via mass media or ...

In Russia, cinema is being considered as a means of individual and social transformation, which makes a contribution to the formation of the Russian audience’s outlook, including their attitudes towards topical social issues. At the same time, the question of the effectiveness of films’ impact remains an open question in psychological science. According to the empirical orientation of our approach to the study of mass media influence, our goal was to obtain new data on the positive impact of films based on specific experimental research. The task was to identify changes in the attitudes of young people, as the most active viewers, towards topical social issues after watching a specifically selected film. Using a psychosemantic technique that included 25 scales designed to identify attitudes towards elderly people, respondents evaluated their various characteristics before and after watching the film. Using a number of characteristics related to the motivational, emotional and cognitive spheres, significant changes were revealed. At the same time, significant differences were found in assessments of the elderly between undergraduate students and postgraduate students. After watching the film, postgraduate students’ attitudes towards elderly people changed in a positive way, while undergraduate students’ negative assessments only worsened. The revealed opposite trends can be explained by individual differences of respondents, which include age, educational status as an indicator of individual psychological characteristics, the experience of interaction with elderly people and, as a result, attitudes towards elderly people at the time before watching the movie. The finding that previous attitudes mediate the impact of the film complements the ideas of the contribution of individual differences to media effects. Most of the changes detected immediately after watching ... [Content truncated]",

        "Question": "How do media portrayals of leisure in war zones affect public perception of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine?",
        "Answer": "Media portrayals of leisure in war zones, such as the video of a beach party in Kyiv, can significantly affect public perception of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine in several ways:\n\n1. **Normalization of War’s Impact**: Leisure activities depicted in media can suggest a sense of normalcy and resilience among war-affected populations. By highlighting scenes of enjoyment and social interaction, media may inadvertently convey that life goes on despite the war, potentially downplaying the severity and urgency of the ongoing conflict. This portrayal can lead to external observers perceiving the situation as less dire or serious than it is, thereby impacting public support for action or humanitarian assistance [Query 1_evidence_1].\n\n2. **Coping Mechanisms**: Media representations of leisure can reflect the coping strategies employed by individuals living in conflict zones. These portrayals underscore how residents strive for normalcy through leisure activities, which serve as essential outlets for stress relief amidst ongoing violence. While this resilience is commendable, it can create an impression that the population is unaffected by the war’s consequences, thus influencing outside perceptions and policy decisions regarding international support and intervention [Query 2_evidence_1].\n\n3. **Overshadowing the Harsh Realities**: Leisure-focused media coverage can shift attention away from the more severe impacts of war, such as displacement, trauma, and the destruction of infrastructure. For children and families, the war has resulted in significant disruptions to their daily lives, education, and mental health, which may not be adequately represented in media portrayals that emphasize leisure amid conflict.
