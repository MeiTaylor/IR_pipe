UNICEF and partners are on the ground providing support for those in need. * Available in: * English * * Updated 8 July 2024 More than two years of destruction and displacement, violence, separation from family members and friends, as well as disrupted schooling, health care and social services, have led to a mental health crisis and a learning crisis among Ukraine\u2019s children. Despite their resilience, for many children inside and outside Ukraine the war has wiped out two years of schooling, playtime with friends, and moments spent with loved ones, robbing them of their education and happiness, wreaking havoc on their mental state. UNICEF was in Ukraine before the war escalated and has since increased its reach, staying to deliver for children.

The war has resulted in death, injuries and mass displacement, with millions of people forced to flee their homes. Some children have fled alone, increasing their exposure to abuse, sexual exploitation, and human trafficking. Children are being robbed of their childhoods, of time with friends and family, of a peaceful life. They bear invisible scars and trauma that may take a lifetime to heal. The war has caused significant damage to vital infrastructure, severely impacting access to electricity, heating, water and telecommunications. Families\u2019 incomes and access to services have been decimated.

The Technology and International Affairs Program develops insights to address the governance challenges and large-scale risks of new technologies. Our experts identify actionable best practices and incentives for industry and government leaders on artificial intelligence, cyber threats, cloud security, countering influence operations, reducing the risk of biotechnologies, and ensuring global digital inclusion. The goal of the Partnership for Countering Influence Operations (PCIO) is to foster evidence-based policymaking to counter threats in the information environment. Key roadblocks as found in our work include the lack of: transparency reporting to inform what data is available for research purposes; rules guiding how data can be shared with researchers and for what purposes; and an international mechanism for fostering research collaboration at-scale. Carnegie\u2019s Information Environment Project is a multistakeholder effort to help policymakers understand the information environment, think through the impact of efforts to govern it, and identify promising interventions to foster democracy. Disinformation is widely seen as a pressing challenge for democracies worldwide. Many policymakers are grasping for quick, effective ways to dissuade people from adopting and spreading false beliefs that degrade democratic discourse and can inspire violent or dangerous actions. Yet disinformation has proven difficult to define, understand, and measure, let alone address. Even when leaders know what they want to achieve in countering disinformation, they struggle to make an impact and often don\u2019t realize how little is known about the effectiveness of policies commonly recommended by experts. Policymakers also sometimes fixate on a few pieces of the disinformation puzzle\u2014including novel technologies like social media and artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014without considering the full range of possible responses in realms such as education, journalism, and political institutions.

There have been many films on this horrific chapter in history\u2014from \u201cNight and Fog\u201d to \u201cSchindler's List\u201d to \u201cThe Pianist,\u201d and as recently as \u201cOccupied City\u201d\u2014all asking the viewer to bear witness to unfathomable suffering under a genocidal regime\u2019s brutality. It would be a mistake, however, to interpret Glazer\u2019s adaptation of Martin Amis\u2019 same-titled novel as him asking viewers to simply witness. It\u2019s a disturbing work, guided by a discomforting sense of immaculateness that chills the viewer. It is the sanitation the film performs, which speaks to the now, in a way few Holocaust films have done before. You could, of course, accuse Glazer\u2019s film of merely being a formal exercise. He challenges himself to not only work purely through atmosphere, but also takes the risk of telling this story from a German perspective. Rudolf H\u00f6ss (Christian Friedel) is the commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp. When he first appears on-screen, he is with his wife Hedwig (Sandra H\u00fcller) and their children, relaxing at the riverside, in a verdant field surrounded by lush mountains. Soon we are introduced to their dream house, a tall concrete structure surrounded by a lavish yard and seemingly even taller walls. On the other side of these barriers is the camp itself. Outside of a single shot\u2014a low angle of Rudolf, framed by black smoking billowing in the background\u2014we never really see inside the camp. Instead, viewers are asked to aurally visualize. Much has been explained by Glazer about the two movies occurring within \u201cThe Zone of Interest\u201d (the one perceived through sight and ... [Content truncated]",

As the Israel-Hamas war continues, we asked , journalist and , to analyze differences between how US media and international news outlets are covering the conflict and discuss how media coverage can impact how the public perceives war. Coverage of the Israel-Hamas war has been constant since the start of the conflict on October 7. What have you observed about how US media outlets are approaching this conflict? How does this compare to how news outlets based outside of the US are covering the war? Hamas\u2019 horrific October 7 attack on Israel made headlines for several days, and the media still covers personal stories about individual hostages. However, the attack and Hamas\u2019s nature as a terrorist group have been eclipsed by coverage of Palestinian causalities suffered in Gaza, as they are more current, far greater in numbers, and are captured in daily videos on television. The conflict has been cruel and tragic to everyone, but US media is often crisis-oriented and covers the war as a \u201cplay by play,\u201d as opposed to presenting a broader picture of the impact of the conflict. American coverage of the military campaign tends to lean towards the Israeli and American governments\u2019 narratives, sometimes at the expense of adequately representing Palestinian viewpoints. The number of Palestinian causalities is often reported with a caveat that numbers come from the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, as if to cast doubt on their legitimacy.
