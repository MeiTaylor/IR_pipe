Media can also play a big role in how people see the world around them and how they interpret important international events, including war and conflict. As the Israel-Hamas war continues, we asked , journalist and , to analyze differences between how US media and international news outlets are covering the conflict and discuss how media coverage can impact how the public perceives war. Coverage of the Israel-Hamas war has been constant since the start of the conflict on October 7. What have you observed about how US media outlets are approaching this conflict? How does this compare to how news outlets based outside of the US are covering the war? Hamas’ horrific October 7 attack on Israel made headlines for several days, and the media still covers personal stories about individual hostages. However, the attack and Hamas’s nature as a terrorist group have been eclipsed by coverage of Palestinian causalities suffered in Gaza, as they are more current, far greater in numbers, and are captured in daily videos on television. The conflict has been cruel and tragic to everyone, but US media is often crisis-oriented and covers the war as a “play by play,” as opposed to presenting a broader picture of the impact of the conflict. American coverage of the military campaign tends to lean towards the Israeli and American governments’ narratives, sometimes at the expense of adequately representing Palestinian viewpoints.

We investigate key areas of media evolu tion and transition , including : journalism and industry best practice; new business models; and regulatory adaptation. We work with industry, public and private institutions to explore the ongoing movements and pressures wrought by disruption. Emphasising the impact and promise of new technologies, we aim to understand how digital transition can be harnessed to develop local media and to enhance the role of journalism in democratic, civil society.

(National Archives Identifier 66956835) The Vietnam War (1955–75) was a time of great controversy in the United States. Cold War tensions ran high as the country relentlessly fought against the alleged evils of communism. At the same time, advances in video and audio recording enabled both easier and more news coverage. From 1950 to 1966, the percentage of Americans who owned a television skyrocketed from 9 percent to 93 percent as televisions became essential for everyday life. With the proliferation of televisions, news networks strived to have the most exciting, dramatic, and attractive stories. They competed for the finest reporters, highest-rated equipment, and largest number of viewers. To succeed, they had to do something unprecedented: _on-site_ coverage of the war in Vietnam. For the first time in American history, the news from the front lines was brought straight into the living room. So why was Vietnam called the first “television war”? During World War II, morale was high. Camera crews stayed in noncombat areas to show the happier, more upbeat side of war. The stories were broadcast as motion pictures shown in theaters. And the newscasters shared only good news and reported bad news with a cheery disposition. Government censorship over the media influenced this outlook—if the press wanted access to stories about the war, they had to receive credentials from the military. This ensured that the news didn’t report anything that the military did not want disclosed to ... [Content truncated]",

Media coverage of conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) focuses on female victims of sexual and gender-based violence, drawing on narrow depictions and gender stereotypes to provoke empathy and horror, galvanising calls for action. However, they provide an incomplete picture of the everyday experiences of war and conflict, reinforcing the narrative that sexual violence in conflict is a crime committed by men against women. Although international organisations and the academic community are aware of the diversity of experiences of those victimised by CRSV, this has not been translated into media coverage. Media representations and social norms The media portrayal of conflict-related sexual violence can shape public perceptions, social norms and attitudes. In some cases it can supersede normal institutions of policy making. With this is mind, the media is essential to changing narratives, discourses and the way in which we conceptualise facts. It socially constructs reality, shaping and reproducing norms about gender and sexuality. We construct our reality based on our observations and experiences; the media presents us with many of those experiences, observations, interpretations and attitudes. The widespread access to information disseminated by the media has the potential to impact a broad range of attitudes and behaviours. For example, a study in partnership with UNESCO conducted in Quialana, Mexico of a radio programme intervention designed to challenge gender roles, attitudes and norms around violence against women found that the social mechanism, that is information disseminated publicly via mass media or ...

Ending Discrimination Against People with Mental and Substance Use Disorders: The Evidence for Stigma Change. Washington (DC): National Academies Press (US); 2016 Aug 3. The term “stigma” is used throughout this chapter and the report to represent the complex of attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, and structures that interact at different levels of society (i.e., individuals, groups, organizations, systems) and manifest in prejudicial attitudes about and discriminatory practices against people with mental and substance use disorders. Attention to stigmatizing structures of society, such as laws and regulations, enables examination of prejudice and discrimination against people with mental and substance use disorders. Discriminatory policies and practices can appear to endorse negative social norms and deepen self-stigma. This chapter offers a brief overview of what is currently understood about stigma, including influencing factors and consequences of stigma from the level of society as a whole to the experience of people with behavioral health disorders. Targets for change and interventions for changing stigmatizing attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors are discussed in Chapter 4.

Primary Image: (Image: US Department of Defense.) World War II touched virtually every part of American life, even things so simple as the food people ate, the films they watched, and the music they listened to. The war, especially the effort of the Allies to win it, was the subject of songs, movies, comic books, novels, artwork, comedy routines—every conceivable form of entertainment and culture.

In 1939, for example, Warner Brothers released the movie Confessions of a Nazi Spy based on actual FBI investigations into German espionage in the United States. Some people ... [Content truncated]",

In Russia, cinema is being considered as a means of individual and social transformation, which makes a contribution to the formation of the Russian audience’s outlook, including their attitudes towards topical social issues. At the same time, the question of the effectiveness of films’ impact remains an open question in psychological science. According to the empirical orientation of our approach to the study of mass media influence, our goal was to obtain new data on the positive impact of films based on specific experimental research. The task was to identify changes in the attitudes of young people, as the most active viewers, towards topical social issues after watching a specifically selected film. Using a psychosemantic technique that included 25 scales designed to identify attitudes towards elderly people, respondents evaluated their various characteristics before and after watching the film. Using a number of characteristics related to the motivational, emotional and cognitive spheres, significant changes were revealed. At the same time, significant differences were found in assessments of the elderly between undergraduate students and postgraduate students. After watching the film, postgraduate students’ attitudes towards elderly people changed in a positive way, while undergraduate students’ negative assessments only worsened. The revealed opposite trends can be explained by individual differences of respondents, which include age, educational status as an indicator of individual psychological characteristics, the experience of interaction with elderly people and, as a result, attitudes towards elderly people at the time before watching the movie. The finding that previous attitudes mediate the impact of the film complements the ideas of the contribution of individual differences to media effects. Most of the changes detected immediately after watching ... [Content truncated]",
