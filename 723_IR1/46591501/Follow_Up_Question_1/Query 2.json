(Pool photo via Getty Images) It’s the logical next step since Putin’s quest for victory in Ukraine has stalled. Emissary harnesses Carnegie’s global scholars to deliver incisive, nuanced analysis on the most pressing international affairs challenges. The Kremlin’s activist foreign policy is expanding Russian global influence at a time when the United States and other Western countries are increasingly divided or consumed by domestic problems. The Return of Global Russia project will examine the Kremlin’s ambitions to become a player in far-flung parts of the world where its influence has long been written off, the tools it is relying upon to challenge the liberal international order, and practical Western policy options for how and when to respond to this new challenge. Twenty-four years ago, in July 2000, newly elected Russian President Vladimir Putin was greeted at the G8 summit in Nago, Japan, with a mixture of excitement and disbelief. On the way there, he stopped in Pyongyang and announced a would-be major breakthrough in arms control: the then-leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Il, had told him that North Korea was not interested in developing its own ballistic missile capability and would be content to use “exclusively” rockets from other countries “for peaceful exploration of space.” A month later, Kim made a mockery of Putin’s claim by announcing that what he had told the Russian leader was a joke. The contrast between Putin then and now couldn’t be more striking. This week, Putin traveled to Pyongyang to embrace a fellow dictator and international outcast, blatantly undermining the efforts of the international community to contain North Korean nuclear ambitions that Russia, as a permanent member of the Security Council, had helped craft and pledged to enforce.

AILSA CHANG, HOST: Seven time zones east of Moscow today, Russian President Vladimir Putin greeted the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un. Russia had announced Kim was coming for this summit of two authoritarians, but details of the meeting's timing and location were kept secret until Kim's arrival in his armored train after a two-day journey from Pyongyang. NPR's Charles Maynes reports from Moscow that each leader is looking to gain something from the other.CHARLES MAYNES, BYLINE: Kim's state visit came at Putin's invitation. And the setting, once revealed, was clearly designed to impress. North Korea had recently failed to place its own spy satellites into orbit, so Putin chose the venue of Russia's new Vostochny Cosmodrome for the summit, welcoming Kim with a warm handshake and, later, a personal tour.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Non-English language spoken).MAYNES: As Putin looked on, officials from Roscosmos, the Russian space agency told Kim about the latest in Russian space technology. In fact, before Kim's arrival, Putin told reporters Russia would help North Korea's quest to launch a satellite. That's why we're here, said Putin. The North Korean leader showed a big interest in rocket technology. In turn, Kim was full of praise for his host. Speaking through an interpreter in official remarks before the press, Kim fully endorsed Russia's invasion of Ukraine, calling it part of a sacred struggle to defend Russia against Western imperialism. The day ended with a state dinner and remarks from both leaders.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SUPREME LEADER KIM JONG UN: (Speaking Korean).MAYNES: Through an interpreter, Kim toasted Putin's health...(SOUNDBITE OF CHAIRS MOVING)MAYNES: ...And the crowd rose to its feet as Kim called for ...

It was his first visit there in 24 years, the pageantry was especially lavish even by Russian and North Korean standards, and Kim Jong Un and Putin seized the moment with a new mutual defense pact that echoed the Cold War era. But the upshot is a decidedly mixed bag. On one hand, we shouldn’t read too much into the rendezvous. Putin was perhaps keen to show he still has friends days after representatives of more than 90 countries, many of them deep-pocketed, gathered in Switzerland to forge a Ukraine peace plan. That summit came on the heels of new Western commitments, including by the U.S., to provide Kyiv with better weapons and more money. Putin’s turning to the hermit Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, by contrast, was not the most impressive optics. In addition, the mutual defense pact that Kim and Putin announced—an “alliance,” according to Kim, but not Putin—isn’t worth all that much. Both Russia and North Korea have nuclear weapons. It’s the nukes, not their new diplomatic partnership, that provide their best deterrent against attack. There’s also the fact that China can’t be happy with this budding friendship. Beijing doesn’t need Putin emboldening Kim to act more aggressively, further destabilizing a region China would prefer to keep quiet. Threats from North Korea drive South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. closer together, creating problems for Beijing in East Asia. On the other hand, top-level Russia–North Korea cooperation should concern Western governments. North Korea, like Russia, is a dangerous nuclear-armed country with sophisticated cybercapabilities. If Kim is listening to foreign friends, America and Europe would prefer he turn to China’s Xi Jinping, who wants more stability in the global order, than to Putin, who benefits ...

Kim said North Korea would always stand with Russia on the \"anti-imperialist\" front. North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency on Thursday said the partnership between the two nations, \"consolidated in trials of history generation after generation and century after century, are further developing into the invincible comrade-in-arms relations.\" The allies' meeting at a remote Russian space launch facility came \"at a significant and crucial time\" for the countries' relations, KCNA noted. It took place amid mounting concern that the two heavily-sanctioned countries may strike a deal to exchange weapons and satellite technology that could give Putin a boost in his flailing war in Ukraine and propel North Korea more quickly toward its goals of launching spy satellites into orbit and obtaining a long-range nuclear missile capability. Kim called North Korea's relations with Russia his nation's \"first priority,\" while Putin later said that despite United Nations sanctions barring the supply of weaponry to Kim's country, he saw \"opportunities for cooperation.\" The leaders met for about two hours at a remote Siberian rocket launch facility for a summit that underscored how their interests are aligning in the face of their countries' separate, intensifying confrontations with the United States. They later continued their talks in different formats, meeting for a total of four to five hours, officials said. \"We are confident that the Russian army and people will win a great victory in the just fight to punish evil groups who pursue ...

The pair met on Wednesday at the Vostochny space centre after Mr Kim arrived in his private armoured train. Mr Putin also said he would help Pyongyang develop satellites. The US says Moscow is buying weapons for its war on Ukraine, and warned any help would violate UN resolutions. Mr Putin has also accepted an invitation from Mr Kim to visit North Korea, according to Pyongyang. Few heads of state have visited the closed-off state. Wednesday's meeting between the two sanctioned regimes, which included senior officials from both sides, took place at a time when their relations with the West are at an all-time low. Mr Kim was warmly received by Mr Putin after travelling for two days to Russia's far east. Russian state media footage showed the two leaders grinning as they shook hands, before Mr Putin personally escorted Mr Kim around the space centre. Citing historical ties between the Soviet Union and North Korea, Mr Putin welcomed his counterpart with the Russian proverb \"an old friend is better than two new ones\". Asked if Russia would help North Korea build satellites, Mr Putin said \"this is why we've come to Vostochny Cosmodrome\", Russian media reported. Mr Putin also said they would \"discuss all topics\" when asked if he would talk to Mr Kim about a weapons deal. Meanwhile, Mr Kim appeared to express support for Mr Putin's war in Ukraine. \"Russia has risen to a sacred fight to protect its sovereignty and security against the hegemonic forces\" of the West, Mr Kim told Mr Putin. \"We will always support the decisions of President Putin and the Russian leadership... and we will be together in ...
