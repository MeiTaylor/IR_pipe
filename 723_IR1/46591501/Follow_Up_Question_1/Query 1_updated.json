AILSA CHANG, HOST: Seven time zones east of Moscow today, Russian President Vladimir Putin greeted the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un. Russia had announced Kim was coming for this summit of two authoritarians, but details of the meeting's timing and location were kept secret until Kim's arrival in his armored train after a two-day journey from Pyongyang. NPR's Charles Maynes reports from Moscow that each leader is looking to gain something from the other.CHARLES MAYNES, BYLINE: Kim's state visit came at Putin's invitation. And the setting, once revealed, was clearly designed to impress. North Korea had recently failed to place its own spy satellites into orbit, so Putin chose the venue of Russia's new Vostochny Cosmodrome for the summit, welcoming Kim with a warm handshake and, later, a personal tour.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Non-English language spoken).MAYNES: As Putin looked on, officials from Roscosmos, the Russian space agency told Kim about the latest in Russian space technology. In fact, before Kim's arrival, Putin told reporters Russia would help North Korea's quest to launch a satellite. That's why we're here, said Putin. The North Korean leader showed a big interest in rocket technology. In turn, Kim was full of praise for his host. Speaking through an interpreter in official remarks before the press, Kim fully endorsed Russia's invasion of Ukraine, calling it part of a sacred struggle to defend Russia against Western imperialism. The day ended with a state dinner and remarks from both leaders.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SUPREME LEADER KIM JONG UN: (Speaking Korean).MAYNES: Through an interpreter, Kim toasted Putin's health...(SOUNDBITE OF CHAIRS MOVING)MAYNES: ...And the crowd rose to its feet as Kim called for ...

The pair met on Wednesday at the Vostochny space centre after Mr Kim arrived in his private armoured train. Mr Putin also said he would help Pyongyang develop satellites. The US says Moscow is buying weapons for its war on Ukraine, and warned any help would violate UN resolutions. Mr Putin has also accepted an invitation from Mr Kim to visit North Korea, according to Pyongyang. Few heads of state have visited the closed-off state. Wednesday's meeting between the two sanctioned regimes, which included senior officials from both sides, took place at a time when their relations with the West are at an all-time low. Mr Kim was warmly received by Mr Putin after travelling for two days to Russia's far east. Russian state media footage showed the two leaders grinning as they shook hands, before Mr Putin personally escorted Mr Kim around the space centre. Citing historical ties between the Soviet Union and North Korea, Mr Putin welcomed his counterpart with the Russian proverb \"an old friend is better than two new ones\". Asked if Russia would help North Korea build satellites, Mr Putin said \"this is why we've come to Vostochny Cosmodrome\", Russian media reported. Mr Putin also said they would \"discuss all topics\" when asked if he would talk to Mr Kim about a weapons deal. Meanwhile, Mr Kim appeared to express support for Mr Putin's war in Ukraine. \"Russia has risen to a sacred fight to protect its sovereignty and security against the hegemonic forces\" of the West, Mr Kim told Mr Putin. \"We will always support the decisions of President Putin and the Russian leadership... and we will be together in ...

Rating: ] A that frequently goes viral on social media is often presented as an awkward exchange between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin, betraying a lack of trust between the two. A popular account on X, for example, shared the clip in late 2023 with the caption \"Trust issues\": ! This video was manipulated. The portion appearing to show the two leaders placing their full drinks on the table after toasting is simply a clip of the two picking their glasses up played in reverse. The full shows the action as it occurred, and it ends with both leaders sipping from their drinks after their toast: This meeting occurred in Russia on April 25, 2019, following a breakdown of talks between former U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim over North Korea's nuclear program, with Putin attempting to serve as a mediator, as by The Washington Post: > Russian President Vladimir Putin emerged from his first summit with Kim Jong Un \\ saying that North Korea needs international security guarantees, not just U.S. pledges, to consider giving up its nuclear arsenal. > > Putin\u2019s call for more multinational involvement contrasts sharply with President Trump\u2019s strategy of one-on-one dialogue with the North Korean leader. It also reinforced North Korea\u2019s attempt to link security and sanctions relief as twin demands in negotiations over its nuclear program. Because the video was manipulated to suggest a sequence of events that did not happen, the claim is False. #### Sources ... [Content truncated]",
