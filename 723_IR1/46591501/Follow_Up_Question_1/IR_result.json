(Pool photo via Getty Images) It’s the logical next step since Putin’s quest for victory in Ukraine has stalled. Emissary harnesses Carnegie’s global scholars to deliver incisive, nuanced analysis on the most pressing international affairs challenges. The Kremlin’s activist foreign policy is expanding Russian global influence at a time when the United States and other Western countries are increasingly divided or consumed by domestic problems. The Return of Global Russia project will examine the Kremlin’s ambitions to become a player in far-flung parts of the world where its influence has long been written off, the tools it is relying upon to challenge the liberal international order, and practical Western policy options for how and when to respond to this new challenge. Twenty-four years ago, in July 2000, newly elected Russian President Vladimir Putin was greeted at the G8 summit in Nago, Japan, with a mixture of excitement and disbelief. On the way there, he stopped in Pyongyang and announced a would-be major breakthrough in arms control: the then-leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Il, had told him that North Korea was not interested in developing its own ballistic missile capability and would be content to use “exclusively” rockets from other countries “for peaceful exploration of space.” A month later, Kim made a mockery of Putin’s claim by announcing that what he had told the Russian leader was a joke. The contrast between Putin then and now couldn’t be more striking. This week, Putin traveled to Pyongyang to embrace a fellow dictator and international outcast, blatantly undermining the efforts of the international community to contain North Korean nuclear ambitions that Russia, as a permanent member of the Security Council, had helped craft and pledged to enforce.

        "Question": "What were the specific interactions and toasts between Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin reported in other footage from the event?",
        "Answer": "During their meetings, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin engaged in several significant interactions, particularly involving toasts. First, it was reported that during a state dinner, Kim Jong Un raised a toast with a glass of Russian wine to Putin's health. This gesture was made in the context of a larger diplomatic discourse between the two leaders, where they discussed military cooperation and the situation surrounding the war in Ukraine. Kim's toast signified his endorsement of Putin, reinforcing their cooperative stance at that moment. Furthermore, there were multiple interactions where both leaders expressed mutual respect and cooperation. Reports indicated a formal setting at the Vostochny Cosmodrome, where Kim showed interest in Russian space technology. During this meeting, officials from Roscosmos briefed Kim, and the event culminated in a warm handshake between the leaders. This context of goodwill was accompanied by formalities that included speeches and, crucially, the act of toasting, which typically symbolizes camaraderie in diplomatic settings. Overall, the footage and additional reports confirm that the interactions between Kim and Putin included ceremonial toasts that served as public displays of their diplomatic engagement, debunking any misinterpretations from manipulated footage that suggested otherwise.",
