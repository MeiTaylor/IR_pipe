For the next few days, Kim’s tour of Russia includes visiting aviation factories in Komsomolsk-on-Amur, a marine biology laboratory in Vladivostok, and the Russian Pacific Fleet. Q1: Why is this summit happening now? A1: First, North Korea always sees an opportunity to tighten relations with Russia when U.S.-Russia relations are bad.

Second, North Korea seeks food, fuel, and medicine as supplies have been completely stocked out as a result of the three-year Covid-19 lockdown. The sale of artillery shells, munition, and rockets to Russia allows North Korea a ready source of supplies. CSIS satellite imagery analysis found that shortly after the first North Korean arms transfer to Russia in November 2022, there was a significant uptick in the number of iron ore and petroleum railcars at the Tumangang-Khasan railroad crossing. Third, Kim Jong-un probably sees summit diplomacy with Putin not just as a way to counter Biden’s successful diplomacy in building bilateral, trilateral, and quadrilateral relations among allies in the region, but also ...

Kupchan June 25, 2024 Europe Program By Scott A. Snyder September 7, 2023 2:59 pm (EST) Warming relations between the two pariah states could foster a mutually beneficial weapons and technology trade and raise tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Until Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the North Korea-Russia relationship was characterized by narrow transactionalism and diplomatic misconnects despite the legacy of close relations that existed between North Korea and the Soviet Union through the 1970s. In 2015, Vladimir Putin invited Kim Jong Un to Russia’s commemoration of the seventieth anniversary of the end of World War II, but Kim was not yet ready to engage in summitry at that time. Russia also backed UN Security Council (UNSC) sanctions against North Korea through 2017 and failed to make headway in identifying mutually beneficial areas of economic cooperation. The 2019 summit between Kim and Putin, held months after the failure of the Hanoi summit between Kim and former U.S. President Donald Trump, resulted in Putin’s solo media briefing on the meeting, reflecting the failure of the two sides to find compatibility in their respective interests.

And while Donald Trump may have wanted to do a deal with Kim Jong-un, the constraints the American president is placed under have dashed his chances. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has far greater freedom of manoeuvre and has eased himself into a win-win situation. Either he will extract a genuine concession from the North Korean leader and achieve rare (and deserved) ‘world statesman points’; or — far more likely — he will achieve little, if anything, of substance but declare a ‘peoples’ friendship’, ‘strategic partnership’ or some similar empty commendation. Putin has an outstanding record with fellow hard-liners — particularly those in conflict with the US — Maduro, Erdogan, Assad etc. His skill in dealing with them all is aided enormously by the asymmetry of the relationships. Russia is dominant. But he has also won real admiration from these ‘besieged’ countries’ presidents for what he has achieved (Russia’s ‘resurgence’, ‘indispensable’ Russia…), for standing up to the US, and for his length of stay in power. Kim Jong-un’s fawning praise of Putin in the run-up to the summit, suggests North Korea is no different — another notch in the Russian president’s bedpost. James Nixey, Head of Russia and Eurasia Programme, Chatham House Lest cynicism rule, it is fair to point out the two countries have genuine issues to discuss. North Korea needs remittance income and direct food aid from Russia. There are approximately 10,000 North Korean labourers working in eastern Russia — what is to be their fate now ...

Khaled Khiari, United Nations Assistant Secretary-General for the Middle East and Asia and the Pacific, briefed the Council following the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s 21 November launch of “Chollima-1”, a rocket loaded with the “Malligyong-1” reconnaissance satellite, from the country’s Sohae Satellite Launching Station. “While sovereign States have the right to benefit from peaceful space activities, Security Council resolutions expressly prohibit the DPRK [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] from conducting any launches using ballistic missile technology,” he said. Furthermore, he reiterated condemnations of the Secretary-General, who on 21 November strongly deplored the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s launch of yet another military satellite using ballistic missile technology. Pyongyang must comply with relevant Security Council resolutions, he stressed. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea continues to implement its five-year military plan unveiled in January 2021, he went on to note. Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in the country grows increasingly critical. The United Nations remains deeply concerned about the aid needs there and urges Pyongyang to allow UN agencies to enter the country to assess the situation on the ground.
