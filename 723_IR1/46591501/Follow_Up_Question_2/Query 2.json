Russia, nearing the 19-month mark in its brutal war of attrition against Ukraine, arrived requiring more ammunition and military equipment for the battlefield, which Pyongyang keeps in abundance. North Korea came looking for food, fuel and cash, according to analysts, in addition to technological help for its missile and satellite programs, and parts for its old, Soviet-era military and civilian aircraft. By the time the two leaders had finished, with Mr. Kim scheduled to continue a rare foreign journey that would take him to aviation factories in Komsomolsk-on-Amur and naval facilities in Vladivostok, it wasn’t clear ...

Putin is visiting North Korea this week. Vladimir Smirnov/AFP via Getty Images hide caption SEOUL, South Korea — President Vladimir Putin of Russia has arrived in North Korea for a summit with leader Kim Jong Un. Their meeting, the second in nine months, is a sign of the two countries' deepening political and military partnership built over Russia's war in Ukraine.

But underneath the smiles and ceremony of on Thursday lies what analysts say is the real significance of the latest foreign trip by North Korea's young dictator: a stark message to President Donald Trump that talks with the United States are not the only game in town. North Korea has for months been negotiating with the U.S. — ostensibly toward the goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. Trump left his first meeting with Kim in 2018 saying the pair had a \"special bond.\" However, Kim's last summit with Trump in February . Negotiations between the two sides have since stalled, and it appears they still disagree about what \"denuclearization\" actually means.

Kim is set to meet with Putin in the coming days, the Kremlin said Monday. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a Russian reporter to expect a “full-blown” visit, with talks between delegations and a “formal dinner.” 1/3 The meeting in Vladivostok is likely to fuel concerns in Washington and like-minded capitals about increased military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang at a critical juncture in Russia’s war in Ukraine. U.S. and South Korean officials also have warned that North Korea may seek critical technologies from Russia to boost Pyongyang’s nuclear and weapons ambitions. The two leaders are increasingly finding their perceived interests aligning in their efforts to reduce U.S. influence in the region. Kim is likely to ask for food aid and weapons technology in return for supplying Russia with Soviet-designed munitions, according to U.S. and South Korean officials and security experts. Pyongyang is also likely to be interested in increasing the number of North Korean laborers working in Russia to generate much-needed foreign currency, despite U.N. bans. The Russian and North Korean leaders are set to meet. Why, and why now? White House officials have urged North Korea in recent weeks to cease its arms negotiations with Moscow and to stick to public commitments it has made to not provide or sell arms to Russia. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said at a news briefing Monday that the U.S. government would be watching closely for sanctions violations. “We don’t think it’s a social visit,” Miller told reporters.

At their lavish banquet, they drank Russian wines and toasted the embrace of their two pariah states. And before leaving, they swapped guns as gifts - model rifles from each others' munitions lines. The optics of Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin's date in eastern Russia clearly underscore a relationship that is being strengthened in wartime. It isn't over yet, with the North Korean leader spending several days touring shipyards, aircraft factories and other military sites before he returns home. There had been great anticipation in the lead-up - with global media rapt as Kim trundled for hours in his armoured train over the border. He kept the West guessing for nearly 40 hours before reaching the Vostochny Cosmodrome - a space base in a far-flung eastern corner of Russia. Even then, it was unclear what exactly the pair would be meeting to talk about - with White House warnings last week that the North could sell arms to Russia sparking alarm. Putin had sent ahead a welcome party to greet Kim as his train rolled onto the space base's tracks. A red-carpeted, balustrade staircase was also erected mid-air, waiting for the train to pull in and for the North Korean leader to step out. Putin was waiting in front of the centre when Kim drew up in his limousine. There, before flashing cameras, the two leaders shook hands - the pictures beamed out immediately by state media. Both leaders know the power of showmanship, but the Supreme Leader of North Korea, as Kim is known, is particularly a fan of ceremony. He is third in a dynasty of supreme leaders \"who have generations of mythology constructed ... [Content truncated]",

Putin and Kim promised to forge stronger ties during a two-hour meeting in the Russian city of Vladivostok, where the Russian president also offered to help break the deadlock over North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme. With champagne toasts and performances of Russian folk dances, the meetings seemed deliberately planned to project an image of friendship between the two countries at a time when North Korea’s talks with the United States have stalled. “We have just had quite a substantive discussion, one on one,” Putin said in remarks following the talks. “We were able to discuss both the history of our relations. We also spoke about the present day and prospects for developing bilateral ties. Of course, we discussed the situation on the Korean peninsula as well.” Kim, who arrived in Russia on Wednesday by armoured train, called the talks “very meaningful”. The leaders did not immediately announce any agreements and analysts cautioned that Russia could only offer modest diplomatic and economic support to North Korea . But the friendly tone contrasted with that of the failed summit between Kim and the US president, Donald Trump, in February. Trump and Kim’s ended without agreement and for their failure to make progress on denuclearising the Korean peninsula. North Korea sees Russia as a potential ally in its negotiations with the US and as a potential source of support for its sanctions-battered economy. Kim is expected to remain in Russia for another day, possibly visiting the Russian Pacific Fleet’s museum and a local theatre. Putin and Kim greeted each other warmly on Thursday, shaking hands before beginning two days of highly anticipated talks ... [Content truncated]",

University of Sydney provides funding as a member of The Conversation AU. View all partners North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has reportedly offered his “full and unconditional support” to Russian President Vladimir Putin during his visit to eastern Russia this week. Analysts speculate this could mean ammunition for Russia’s war in Ukraine, given North Korea is believed to have large quantities of ammunition compatible with Russian artillery. It may be of limited help to Russia, though, given North Korean ammunition has low reliability and accuracy and the fact Russia still needs to transfer it thousands of miles to the front. But what does Kim want? As always, North Korea is in need of food, fertiliser and potentially other humanitarian aid. However, it seems unlikely Kim would travel all the way to Russia solely for food aid. North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile program is at an inflection point. Even though outside verification is impossible, North Korea’s nuclear weapons seemingly work. The regime has conducted six nuclear tests between 2006 and 2017. North Korea has also tested increasingly sophisticated ballistic missiles. But it is unclear how survivable these missiles would be against anti-ballistic missile systems, to what extent the nuclear weapons on top of the missiles have been miniaturised, how accurately the missiles can be aimed and how consistently they can be launched. North Korea’s two failed spy satellite launches in the past several months suggest that it has problems with reliability. Russia could, in theory, offer North Korea missile technology know-how from decades of experience in weapons development, as well as advanced satellite technology. This could give North Korea’s spy satellite program a boost after years of trying. Russia might also ... [Content truncated]",
