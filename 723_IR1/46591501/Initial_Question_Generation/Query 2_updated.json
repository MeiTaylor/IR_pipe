It was by my friend and fellow drinker Helena. Her book Vinalogies described wine varieties as certain well known figures, and that got me thinking. If I reversed the idea, how in drink terms would I describe some of our well-known figures of today. I am starting with our leaders. From a completely unscientific and ill-educated stand point (which should suit Mr Trump), I give you my thoughts on what drinks our world leaders might be. I wonder what drink comes out of Russia which has very little finesse? Certainly not Russian sparkling which can be very good, or Russian vodka which as we know is some of the best in the world. In fact, I\u2019ll re-think that last idea. Russia does make some of the worst, most dangerous vodka in the world, and it usually illegal and more commonly known as Meths, now that does sound like Putin? Vladimir Putin: Meths Germany as a nation is known for its ability to be precise, and their leader Angela Merkle is no exception. She has brought her country through a migrant crisis, a global economic crisis and Germany is at the moment the most well organised in Europe at handling Covid-19. If I think about a wine which has precision, it would have to be Riesling. With high acidity, it is incredibly precise, but with age it can mellow and gains a great deal of complexity. Now I think that sounds familiar. Angela Merkel: Riesling Boris is a bit of a dichotomy, some would say that under all that bluster and opposing sweetness, there is a hugely intelligent man with lots of depth and strategy, however others would say ...

During the cold war, North Korea was Moscow\u2019s key ally in north-east Asia. But at that time, the North Koreans were, at best, poor supplicants to a mighty superpower. Today, Kim\u2019s hermit kingdom stands tall and proud as Russia\u2019s partner in crime. Putin\u2019s engagement with North Korea is as old as his presidency. But the relationship was generally more exotic than practical. Russia\u2019s real partner was South Korea, which consistently ranked among its top 10 trade partners, with nearly $30bn in trade volume in 2021. North Korea was never an attractive partner, and it was subject to very restrictive sanctions that Russia, as a permanent member of the UN security council, had helped craft. Until it invaded Ukraine, Russia tried to abide by them in letter and spirit. Everything changed with the invasion. In May 2022 \u2013 in a development that may foreshadow the beginning of the end for the North Korean sanctions regime \u2013 Russia (and China) vetoed a UN security council resolution that would penalise Pyongyang for another round of missile tests. In July 2022, Pyongyang recognised the Russian-occupied puppet republics of Donetsk and Luhansk (just over two months before their annexation by Russia made this recognition moot). Then, in July this year, the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, turned up in Pyongyang to an unprecedented welcome. Kim was seen proudly showing him around the latest models of North Korean weaponry. Amid the ... [Content truncated]",
