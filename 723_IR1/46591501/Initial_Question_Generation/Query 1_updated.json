The pair met on Wednesday at the Vostochny space centre after Mr Kim arrived in his private armoured train. Mr Putin also said he would help Pyongyang develop satellites. The US says Moscow is buying weapons for its war on Ukraine, and warned any help would violate UN resolutions. Mr Putin has also accepted an invitation from Mr Kim to visit North Korea, according to Pyongyang. Few heads of state have visited the closed-off state. Wednesday's meeting between the two sanctioned regimes, which included senior officials from both sides, took place at a time when their relations with the West are at an all-time low. Mr Kim was warmly received by Mr Putin after travelling for two days to Russia's far east. Russian state media footage showed the two leaders grinning as they shook hands, before Mr Putin personally escorted Mr Kim around the space centre. Citing historical ties between the Soviet Union and North Korea, Mr Putin welcomed his counterpart with the Russian proverb \"an old friend is better than two new ones\". Asked if Russia would help North Korea build satellites, Mr Putin said \"this is why we've come to Vostochny Cosmodrome\", Russian media reported. Mr Putin also said they would \"discuss all topics\" when asked if he would talk to Mr Kim about a weapons deal. Meanwhile, Mr Kim appeared to express support for Mr Putin's war in Ukraine. \"Russia has risen to a sacred fight to protect its sovereignty and security against the hegemonic forces\" of the West, Mr Kim told Mr Putin. \"We will always support the decisions of President Putin and the Russian leadership... and we will be together in ...

Rating: ] A that frequently goes viral on social media is often presented as an awkward exchange between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin, betraying a lack of trust between the two. A popular account on X, for example, shared the clip in late 2023 with the caption \"Trust issues\": ! This video was manipulated. The portion appearing to show the two leaders placing their full drinks on the table after toasting is simply a clip of the two picking their glasses up played in reverse. The full shows the action as it occurred, and it ends with both leaders sipping from their drinks after their toast: This meeting occurred in Russia on April 25, 2019, following a breakdown of talks between former U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim over North Korea's nuclear program, with Putin attempting to serve as a mediator, as by The Washington Post: > Russian President Vladimir Putin emerged from his first summit with Kim Jong Un \\ saying that North Korea needs international security guarantees, not just U.S. pledges, to consider giving up its nuclear arsenal. > > Putin\u2019s call for more multinational involvement contrasts sharply with President Trump\u2019s strategy of one-on-one dialogue with the North Korean leader. It also reinforced North Korea\u2019s attempt to link security and sanctions relief as twin demands in negotiations over its nuclear program. Because the video was manipulated to suggest a sequence of events that did not happen, the claim is False. #### Sources ... [Content truncated]",

Putin and Kim shook hands at the Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia\u2019s Amur Region; the North Korean leader got a lift in Putin\u2019s Russian-made Aurus limousine; and Kim raised a toast to his counterpart, promising Russia would punish \u201cevil forces\u201d \u2013 dictator-speak that appeared to endorse Putin\u2019s ghastly, grinding war of attrition against Ukraine. But the two sides held no press conference and issued no communique. No deals were publicly announced. Figuring out the real takeaway from the summit in Russia\u2019s Far East is going to be a challenge, even though the global stakes are quite high. Back in July, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu went to Pyongyang with an apparent shopping list. After a year and a half of high-intensity combat in Ukraine, Russia\u2019s ammunition stocks have been heavily depleted, and US officials warned that North Korea and Russia were mulling potential deals to replenish supplies for Moscow\u2019s war on Ukraine.

It\u2019s a life-or-death race, with Putin apparently counting on support waning for Ukraine as the US enters a presidential election season. And there\u2019s potential ... [Content truncated]",

Mr Kim left Pyongyang on Sunday afternoon via his private train, state media KCNA reported on Tuesday. Photos released by state media showed military honour guards and crowds of people in dark suits and colourful dresses waving flowers and flags as he boarded the dark green train, which is believed to be armoured and carry other specialised equipment. Japan's Kyodo news agency reported on Tuesday, citing an unnamed Russian official source, that a train carrying Kim had arrived at Khasan station, the main rail gateway to Russia's Far East from North Korea. The trip to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin will be a full-scale visit, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. US officials have said the leaders will likely discuss North Korean arms sales to refill Russian reserves drained by its war on Ukraine. According to US reports, the two will meet in the eastern city of Vladivostok, where they previously met in April 2019. The trip comes at a time when the leaders' interests are aligning in the face of their deepening, separate confrontations with the United States. Whether Mr Kim would again make the rattling 20-hour journey by rail has been a focus of media attention, as is the reportedly luxurious train, which stands in sharp contrast to the grinding poverty of daily life for most North Koreans. Kim Jong Un's famously flight-averse father, Kim Jong Il, made about a dozen trips abroad during his 17-year rule, almost all to China and all by train.

At a meeting in Pyongyang last July, North Korea\u2019s defense minister, Kang Sun Nam, and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, vowed to expand their countries\u2019 military cooperation to \u201cresolutely stand against\u201d their \u201ccommon enemy,\u201d the United States. Then, at a September summit with President Vladimir Putin in Russia, the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un toasted the Kremlin\u2019s \u201csacred struggle\u201d against \u201ca band of evil\u201d\u2014a reference to Western countries\u2014and called Putin the \u201cKorean people\u2019s closest friend.\u201d The North Korean\u2013Russian convergence goes beyond rhetoric. Russia has been propping up the Kim regime with food aid, along with fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, armored vehicles, and equipment for ballistic missile production. There are signs that Russia is sharing its expertise, too. In July, North Korea conducted a test launch of a technologically sophisticated intercontinental ballistic missile, and in November, it managed to send its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit after several failed attempts. The transfer of critical supplies goes both ways. North Korea is sending Russia much-needed artillery shells to use in its war in Ukraine, with U.S. officials confirming in October that more than 1,000 containers of arms had arrived in Russia by ship and by train. Pyongyang\u2019s equipment is hardly world-class\u2014its shells have a 20 percent failure rate, whereas most advanced U.S. munitions have failure rates in the low single digits\u2014but many of North Korea\u2019s missiles are difficult for Ukraine to defend itself against because they are long-range, which allows Russian forces to fire from deep within their own territory, and low-tech, which helps them evade detection. North Korean military assistance could therefore be decisive in Russia\u2019s campaign to halt ... [Content truncated]",
