(Pool photo via Getty Images) It’s the logical next step since Putin’s quest for victory in Ukraine has stalled. Emissary harnesses Carnegie’s global scholars to deliver incisive, nuanced analysis on the most pressing international affairs challenges. The Kremlin’s activist foreign policy is expanding Russian global influence at a time when the United States and other Western countries are increasingly divided or consumed by domestic problems. The Return of Global Russia project will examine the Kremlin’s ambitions to become a player in far-flung parts of the world where its influence has long been written off, the tools it is relying upon to challenge the liberal international order, and practical Western policy options for how and when to respond to this new challenge. Twenty-four years ago, in July 2000, newly elected Russian President Vladimir Putin was greeted at the G8 summit in Nago, Japan, with a mixture of excitement and disbelief. On the way there, he stopped in Pyongyang and announced a would-be major breakthrough in arms control: the then-leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Il, had told him that North Korea was not interested in developing its own ballistic missile capability and would be content to use “exclusively” rockets from other countries “for peaceful exploration of space.” A month later, Kim made a mockery of Putin’s claim by announcing that what he had told the Russian leader was a joke. The contrast between Putin then and now couldn’t be more striking. This week, Putin traveled to Pyongyang to embrace a fellow dictator and international outcast, blatantly undermining the efforts of the international community to contain North Korean nuclear ambitions that Russia, as a permanent member of the Security Council, had helped craft and pledged to enforce.

During the cold war, North Korea was Moscow’s key ally in north-east Asia. But at that time, the North Koreans were, at best, poor supplicants to a mighty superpower. Today, Kim’s hermit kingdom stands tall and proud as Russia’s partner in crime. Putin’s engagement with North Korea is as old as his presidency. But the relationship was generally more exotic than practical. Russia’s real partner was South Korea, which consistently ranked among its top 10 trade partners, with nearly $30bn in trade volume in 2021. North Korea was never an attractive partner, and it was subject to very restrictive sanctions that Russia, as a permanent member of the UN security council, had helped craft. Until it invaded Ukraine, Russia tried to abide by them in letter and spirit. Everything changed with the invasion. In May 2022 – in a development that may foreshadow the beginning of the end for the North Korean sanctions regime – Russia (and China) vetoed a UN security council resolution that would penalise Pyongyang for another round of missile tests. In July 2022, Pyongyang recognised the Russian-occupied puppet republics of Donetsk and Luhansk (just over two months before their annexation by Russia made this recognition moot). Then, in July this year, the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, turned up in Pyongyang to an unprecedented welcome. Kim was seen proudly showing him around the latest models of North Korean weaponry. Amid the ... [Content truncated]",

        "Question": "Is there verified evidence of Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin toasting together in this video?",
        "Answer": "Yes, there is verified evidence that Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin did toast together, but the claims about them placing their drinks down without consuming them are misleading due to manipulated video footage. The original video clip that circulated implied an awkward moment in which both leaders toasted but then placed their full drinks on the table, suggesting a lack of trust. However, fact-checking indicates that this segment was altered to appear that way; the actual video was played in reverse. In reality, the complete footage shows both leaders toasting and then drinking from their glasses after the toast. Furthermore, their meeting was noted to be a full-scale diplomatic exchange, and there were numerous reports and videos from the event showcasing their interactions, including them toasting with champagne. Therefore, while there is evidence of a toast, the portrayal that they refrained from consuming their drinks is inaccurate.",
