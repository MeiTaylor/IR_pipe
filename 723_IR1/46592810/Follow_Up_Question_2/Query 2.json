Initiated in 2017, Society Hotel Bingen consists of five distinct yet related components across a multifaceted 2.57-acre campus, including the adaptive reuse of a former school, twenty individual hotel cabins, a covered pathway, a spa and bathhouse building, and a sanctuary. Anchoring the retreat is the 80-year-old Bingen Schoolhouse, which was originally constructed in 1908, and was rebuilt in 1937 by the Civilian Conservation Corps after a fire in 1933. Melding modern comfort with historical preservation, the schoolhouse hotel was retrofitted by Waechter Architecture to retain most of its original feel. Inside and out, Society Hotel Bingen features interiors and landscape design by BLOSSOM, the Portland-based firm founded by Megan Blossom. Sited near the riverfront within a residential setting, the main schoolhouse building offers 10 private standard rooms and two 24-bed hostels, as well as a library in the reception area, lockers ...

The landlocked nation is teeming with thermal water springsâmore than 1,300, with 123 in Budapest aloneâwhich bring infinite opportunities for year-round bathing in spas all over the country. These water sources are rich in dissolved minerals, with the exact mineral content varying depending on the location. They are curative as well as luxuriously calming. Some are sulfurous-smelling, some are salty, and some have other special properties; they are each specifically recommended for healing certain health conditions. Wellness and spa culture have been a part of the Hungarian lifestyle for hundreds of years. Soaking in the warm mineral waters may feel decadent, but these spas arenât seen as indulgences. In Hungary they are just part of a balanced life.

These 16th-century bathhouses have similar structures with central octagon-shaped pools topped by high domed ceilings through which rays of light pierce the water. There are smaller pools surrounding the main one, and saunas and steam rooms beyond. Budapestâs Turkish bathhousesâthe Rudas FÃ¼rdÅ, KirÃ¡ly FÃ¼rdÅ, and Veli Bej FÃ¼rdÅjeâare all located near the Danube bank on the Buda side, close to the thermal sources. **âSpa Cityâsâ Architectural Treasures**: Besides the Turkish bathhouses, Budapest boasts many other historic baths, earning it the moniker âSpa City.â The steam rising from the outdoor pools at the neo-baroque SzÃ©chenyi FÃ¼rdÅ is an iconic ...

The hotel is the first property in the city to have an on-site spa that uses the local mineral-rich springs. Now the elegant spa town has had its reputation renewed for the 21st century with the opening of the sumptuous Gainsborough Bath Spa hotel. The new resort occupies a landmarked Georgian limestone building in the heart of town and is the first property in Bath to offer an on-site spa that uses the waters of the original source. Guests enjoy complimentary access to the facility, which includes treatment rooms, thermal pools, saunas, a steam room, and a fitness center. A sitting area of a two-bedroom suite.
