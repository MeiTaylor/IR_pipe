The TV adaptation doesn’t veer far from the script set by the video game. That confidence is not misplaced. The 2013 PlayStation 3 title, Naughty Dog’s “The Last of Us,” broke ground as a video game that looked more like a prestige TV show or film than just about any other game before it. Players took on the roles of Joel, a long-grieving father turned black market smuggler who suffered immeasurable tragedy at the start of a zombie outbreak, and 14-year-old Ellie, an orphan who has only ever known the post-apocalypse — a militarized and zombie-ridden America. This Sunday — nearly a decade after the first game’s release — old PlayStation fans and new viewers alike will see fresh faces in those roles: Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey playing Ellie. The zombies in “The Last of Us” aren’t the undead. Instead, they are humans infected by a souped-up version of the real-life Cordyceps fungus, which takes over the brain functions of creatures, mostly insects. In “The Last of Us,” humans are susceptible to this fungal infection and become manic, ravenous monsters. And unlike a viral pandemic, there is no vaccine. HBO’s take on the video game property finally answers the question: What if a big-budget TV or film adaptation stayed faithful to the source material, even repeating the same scenes, lines and big story beats? Because that’s exactly what the show does. There are scenes throughout the first season that are direct line reads of key scenes from the game. The nine episodes follow the exact same story beats and almost the same locations as the original game too. People who know the game ... [Content truncated]",

Well. It finally happened. They stole my design. **SHEIN STOLE MY DESIGN.** I wish I could say “I can’t believe it!!!” but actually, I can. I’ve seen numerous videos and articles written about Shein straight up robbing independent designer’s designs, but guess what? As much as the comments may show sympathy and anger, it’s the dollar that speaks the loudest in the end. Shein is now worth over $100 BILLION, which to give you some perspective, is more than Zara and H&M COMBINED. Yes, I am angry that Shein stole my design (numb actually), but I am 100 billion times angrier that a business that runs on robbery is being supported and rewarded like this. What confuses me is that Gen Z, the generation that comes off as very ethically conscious, sustainability-focused, and authenticity oriented, is also the group that is fueling this monster’s rise. Women under 25 is the target demographic of Shein…and also happens to be part of my audience’s demographic as well. There’s so much I have to say on this topic, but let’s start with the design theft. Last night I was relaxing on the couch with Sam after dinner, and then he says “omg”. I turn quickly and say “what? WHAT???” He’s silent for a sec and doesn’t want to show me his ...

Likewise, the live stream of Philando Castile being shot by police accumulated over 2.4 million views in just 24 hours. After Sandra Bland was found dead following a minor traffic violation, bodycam footage of her horrific police encounter garnered hundreds of thousands of views in a few short days. Concerned about how seeing images of Black people dead and dying would affect young social media users, I conducted a study to understand how digitally mediated traumas were impacting Black girls’ mental and emotional wellness. As I completed interviews with nearly 20 Black girls (ages 18-24) across the US and Canada, my initial fears were quickly confirmed: Black girls reported unprecedented levels of anxiety, depression, fear and chronic stress from encountering Black death online. The most common phrases participants used were “traumatizing,” “exhausting” and “PTSD.” Many of the girls endured mental, emotional and physiological effects, including insomnia, migraines, nausea, prolonged “numbness” and dissociation. According to Natasha, “seeing Black people get killed by police, that does something to you psychologically.” Similarly, Evenlyn said, \"When people die or when Black males are shot by the police and people post the video, that’s traumatizing. Last summer…everybody would post everything, and I was just sad and exhausted.” Danielle surmises the collective trauma, noting “we all have PTSD…because of social media, because of all this constant coverage…emotionally I can say it has taken a toll on me. It’s taken a toll on all of us.” Mental health concerns directly affected schooling experiences, with many girls too overwhelmed, triggered or physically exhausted to fully engage in academics following high profile police killings. Though viral death videos were amongst the most salient causes of digitally mediated trauma, they ... [Content truncated]",
