Only saw how engaged and animated the campers were when _Baby Shark_ was performed, so when he became a full-time children's entertainer, he released his own version. That was in 2011, five years before another version of _Baby Shark_ became a global phenomenon. If you're a parent with a child under, say, five or six, you know this song. It's the same song that plays in your head on an endless rotation and wakes you up from an already light sleep. Over an upbeat, K Pop-style beat, we meet a family of sharks, beginning with, of course, \"Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo.\" So simple and catchy in its premise, once it gets into your head, it never leaves.

David Dee Delgado/Getty Images hide caption Protesters with signs linking the late Jeffrey Epstein to conspiracy theories at the sex trafficking trial of his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell , in November 2021 in New York City. Jeffrey Epstein has been dead for three years, but his ghost still wanders the dark halls of the internet. In life, Epstein was a secretive financier, arrested for a series of sexual crimes with underaged girls. In death, speculation about his suicide in jail formed an additional layer of conspiratorial fog around his legacy. When the FBI searched former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in early August, it took less than a day for far-right internet personality Jack Posobiec to summon Epstein's ghost. \"We now know the judge who signed off on the Mar-a-Lago raid was Jeffrey Epstein's lawyer. Don't question it!\" Posobiec posted to his 185,000 Telegram followers. The claim, repeated across fringe threads and deceiving \"headlines,\" is misleading. While in private practice, federal magistrate judge Bruce Reinhart had previously represented some of Epstein's employees who had also been accused of facilitating sex trafficking. In the case of the Mar-a-Lago search, the Miami Herald reported any magistrate judge would have signed off on the warrant when presented with probable cause from the FBI. Reinhart just happened to be available that night. Within days, the false claim took off in far-right circles, drawing the attention of Fox News, which later had to issue a clarification for airing an edited picture that falsely showed Reinhart next to Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted as an accomplice to many of Epstein's crimes.

        "Answer": "Based on the evidence extracted, there are alternative sources that suggest the viral video claiming to show young girls in a house on Jeffrey Epstein's island may not be authentic and likely originates from a different location: 1. **Fact-checking by Yahoo**: This report indicates that various social media users have labeled the video as potentially misleading, asserting that it was filmed in a different setting, specifically identifying it as being shot at a five-star hotel rather than Epstein's island. This directly challenges the claim made by the viral video, suggesting that its origins are misrepresented [Query 1_evidence_1]. 2. **Analysis by Snopes**: Snopes has highlighted that following the release of documents related to Epstein, misleading images and videos have circulated. They point out that many of these claims lack credible evidence linking them to Epstein, implying that the video in question may also fit into this pattern of misinformation. This reinforces the assertion that the video does not originate from Epstein's properties and is instead one of many misleading representations [Query 2_evidence_1].",
