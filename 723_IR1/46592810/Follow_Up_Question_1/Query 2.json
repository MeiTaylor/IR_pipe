David Dee Delgado/Getty Images hide caption Protesters with signs linking the late Jeffrey Epstein to conspiracy theories at the sex trafficking trial of his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell , in November 2021 in New York City. Jeffrey Epstein has been dead for three years, but his ghost still wanders the dark halls of the internet. In life, Epstein was a secretive financier, arrested for a series of sexual crimes with underaged girls. In death, speculation about his suicide in jail formed an additional layer of conspiratorial fog around his legacy. When the FBI searched former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in early August, it took less than a day for far-right internet personality Jack Posobiec to summon Epstein's ghost. \"We now know the judge who signed off on the Mar-a-Lago raid was Jeffrey Epstein's lawyer. Don't question it!\" Posobiec posted to his 185,000 Telegram followers. The claim, repeated across fringe threads and deceiving \"headlines,\" is misleading. While in private practice, federal magistrate judge Bruce Reinhart had previously represented some of Epstein's employees who had also been accused of facilitating sex trafficking. In the case of the Mar-a-Lago search, the Miami Herald reported any magistrate judge would have signed off on the warrant when presented with probable cause from the FBI. Reinhart just happened to be available that night. Within days, the false claim took off in far-right circles, drawing the attention of Fox News, which later had to issue a clarification for airing an edited picture that falsely showed Reinhart next to Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted as an accomplice to many of Epstein's crimes. This is just the ... [Content truncated]",

A swarm of federal agents was seen fanning out across Little St. James in golf carts about 10:30 a.m. \"We were just trying to look at pretty fish and swim with turtles and here we are in the middle of an FBI raid,\" said Kelly Quinn, the owner of Salty Dog Day Sails, who was running a sailing charter in the area. \"This has been something on our radar for years,\" Quinn added. \"We're all really curious why it's happening now.\" Two senior law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation confirmed that the FBI launched a search of off the coast of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The search was directed by led by the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, the officials said. An office spokesperson declined to comment. A law enforcement source said the search of Epstein's home and private island in the U.S. Virgin islands was suggested years ago, but evidently went nowhere. The raid was launched two days after Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City. He was pronounced dead at a lower Manhattan hospital. Multiple law enforcement officials said Epstein appeared to have hanged himself, but his official cause of death is pending. Epstein had been held at the federal jail since July 6, when he was arrested on charges of trafficking and sexually abusing girls as young as 14 in the early 2000s. He was facing up to 45 years in prison if convicted on two counts of sex trafficking and conspiracy. Epstein purchased the picturesque island off the coast of St. ... [Content truncated]",

Out of all of their stories, one is the most explosive and bizarre — a woman who says Trump violently raped her at an orgy when she was just 13 years old. But the horrific details of her accusation have gotten the least attention. It seemed like that was all going to change Wednesday, when the woman, who has gone by the pseudonyms “Katie Johnson” and “Jane Doe,” was set to appear at a press conference at the law offices of Lisa Bloom, a high-profile civil rights attorney and TV commentator. But the woman didn’t come to the press conference. Bloom told a room full of waiting reporters that Johnson was afraid to show her face after receiving multiple death threats, and that they would have to reschedule. Then on Friday, Bloom announced that Johnson had dropped her lawsuit: It’s for victims of sexual assault to want to preserve their anonymity, and dropping a lawsuit doesn’t mean admitting that the case had no merit. Jill Harth, who sued Trump for sexual assault in 1997, still stands by her claims even though she dropped the lawsuit. And it would indeed have been an intense couple of days for Johnson — Bloom that her firm’s website was hacked, that Anonymous had claimed responsibility, and that death threats and a bomb threat came in afterwards. It was the end of an incredibly strange case that featured an anonymous plaintiff who had refused almost all requests for interviews, two anonymous corroborating witnesses whom no one in the press had spoken to, and a couple of seriously shady characters — with an anti-Trump agenda and a penchant for drama — who had aggressively shopped the story around to media outlets for over ...
