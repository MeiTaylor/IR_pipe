The TV adaptation doesn\u2019t veer far from the script set by the video game. That confidence is not misplaced. The 2013 PlayStation 3 title, Naughty Dog\u2019s \u201cThe Last of Us,\u201d broke ground as a video game that looked more like a prestige TV show or film than just about any other game before it. Players took on the roles of Joel, a long-grieving father turned black market smuggler who suffered immeasurable tragedy at the start of a zombie outbreak, and 14-year-old Ellie, an orphan who has only ever known the post-apocalypse \u2014 a militarized and zombie-ridden America. This Sunday \u2014 nearly a decade after the first game\u2019s release \u2014 old PlayStation fans and new viewers alike will see fresh faces in those roles: Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey playing Ellie. The zombies in \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d aren\u2019t the undead. Instead, they are humans infected by a souped-up version of the real-life Cordyceps fungus, which takes over the brain functions of creatures, mostly insects. In \u201cThe Last of Us,\u201d humans are susceptible to this fungal infection and become manic, ravenous monsters. And unlike a viral pandemic, there is no vaccine.

Students will watch one video a day and then either write or record a response to the video. While I wanted to draw in specific non-fiction skills, I also just wanted students to have a chance to connect and respond. To see my very much work in progress assignment, While I had several videos I knew I wanted to use with students, I also knew that there were many I had not yet discovered. Enter my incredible Twitter network. ! 87 replies later, still growing, and I could not believe once again the treasure trove of incredible videos that were suggested. My gratitude runs deep and so does my penchant for sharing, so without further ado, here are many of the replies given to me with thanks to those who shared them. I am so grateful for all of you. Some are not here that were suggested more than once. I have also ones that we have used throughout the year that have started great discussion in our classroom.

As much as the comments may show sympathy and anger, it\u2019s the dollar that speaks the loudest in the end. Shein is now worth over $100 BILLION, which to give you some perspective, is more than Zara and H&M COMBINED. Yes, I am angry that Shein stole my design (numb actually), but I am 100 billion times angrier that a business that runs on robbery is being supported and rewarded like this. What confuses me is that Gen Z, the generation that comes off as very ethically conscious, sustainability-focused, and authenticity oriented, is also the group that is fueling this monster\u2019s rise. Women under 25 is the target demographic of Shein\u2026and also happens to be part of my audience\u2019s demographic as well. There\u2019s so much I have to say on this topic, but let\u2019s start with the design theft. Last night I was relaxing on the couch with Sam after dinner, and then he says \u201comg\u201d.

Likewise, the live stream of Philando Castile being shot by police accumulated over 2.4 million views in just 24 hours. After Sandra Bland was found dead following a minor traffic violation, bodycam footage of her horrific police encounter garnered hundreds of thousands of views in a few short days. Concerned about how seeing images of Black people dead and dying would affect young social media users, I conducted a study to understand how digitally mediated traumas were impacting Black girls\u2019 mental and emotional wellness. As I completed interviews with nearly 20 Black girls (ages 18-24) across the US and Canada, my initial fears were quickly confirmed: Black girls reported unprecedented levels of anxiety, depression, fear and chronic stress from encountering Black death online. The most common phrases participants used were \u201ctraumatizing,\u201d \u201cexhausting\u201d and \u201cPTSD.\u201d Many of the girls endured mental, emotional and physiological effects, including insomnia, migraines, nausea, prolonged \u201cnumbness\u201d and dissociation. According to Natasha, \u201cseeing Black people get killed by police, that does something to you psychologically.\u201d Similarly, Evenlyn said, \"When people die or when Black males are shot by the police and people post the video, that\u2019s traumatizing. Last summer\u2026everybody would post everything, and I was just sad and exhausted.\u201d Danielle surmises the collective trauma, noting \u201cwe all have PTSD\u2026because of social media, because of all this constant coverage\u2026emotionally I can say it has taken a toll on me. It\u2019s taken a toll on all of us.\u201d Mental health concerns directly affected schooling experiences, with many girls too overwhelmed, triggered or physically exhausted to fully engage in academics following high profile police killings.

Only, a children's entertainer based in Upstate New York, was a DJ at a kids camp, and the counselors would regularly perform the song with their campers, acting out the hand gestures and going through each verse. Only saw how engaged and animated the campers were when _Baby Shark_ was performed, so when he became a full-time children's entertainer, he released his own version. That was in 2011, five years before another version of _Baby Shark_ became a global phenomenon. If you're a parent with a child under, say, five or six, you know this song. It's the same song that plays in your head on an endless rotation and wakes you up from an already light sleep. Over an upbeat, K Pop-style beat, we meet a family of sharks, beginning with, of course, \"Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo.\" So simple and catchy in its premise, once it gets into your head, it never leaves. Even if you're not a parent, there's still a good chance you are one of the more than two billion people on the planet who have seen the video, or among the countless millions who have watched someone do the #. In just a few short years, _Baby Shark_ has become one of the 30 most watched YouTube videos in the platform's history. The song, released in 2016 by Korean children's entertainment brand Pinkfong, which is owned by the Seoul-based company SmartStudy, has been performed by the most popular ; featured by ; covered by Josh Groban, Sophie Turner and James Corden on _The Late Late Show_; and mentioned on social media by the likes of and .
