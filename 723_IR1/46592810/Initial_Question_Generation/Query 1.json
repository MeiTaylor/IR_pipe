The names were unsealed from a lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre, an alleged trafficking victim, against British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend. Maxwell, 62, is serving a 20-year prison sentence after she was convicted in December 2021 of helping Epstein recruit and sexually abuse underage girls. Many of those whose names appear in the documents released on Wednesday aren't accused of wrongdoing or have been mentioned previously in legal proceedings or news accounts. Despite persistent assertions across social media, the documents released on Wednesday are not an Epstein \"client list.\" In December, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska found no legal justification for continuing to withhold the names of as many as 175 individuals allegedly connected with Epstein, ordering the unsealing to begin from January 1. Some portions of the records will remain confidential, including those identifying people who were children when they were sexually abused by Epstein, who died by suicide in August 2019 in a federal prison in Manhattan as he awaited trial on sex-trafficking charges. With the release of the names including a number of celebrities, a clip of comedian Gervais taking swipes at celebrities while hosting the 2020 Golden Globe Awards has been shared on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. As he stood before the crowd gathered in Beverly Hills to toast TV and movie talent, five-time host Gervais said: \"In this room are some of the most important TV and film executives in the world, from all different backgrounds. But they all have one thing in common—they're all terrified of Ronan Farrow. ... [Content truncated]",

While the to what was about Epstein’s offenses, they gave fodder to people eager to fictionalize the late, convicted sex offender’s impact on high-profile people and evidence of his crimes.

No evidence connected the video to him. * . There were telltale signs of the photo being fake. For instance, the faces of people in the background are deformed and Trump has only one leg. Think you’ve come across a fake photo or miscaptioned video involving Epstein? for potential fact-checking. Not all rumors linking Epstein to former presidents are made up. For instance, showing Trump with two of his children, Ivanka and Eric, alongside Epstein in the ‘90s is real, as well as that was taken a few years later including Melania Trump and Epstein’s longtime partner, Ghislaine ...

About a month ago, a similar culture war broke out over Jason Aldean’s “Try That in a Small Town,” which pushed a whole lot of political buttons in just a matter of minutes, with opening lyrics that sounded as though Aldean was narrating B-roll footage on a Fox News report on “rising crime in America’s cities.” From the initial social media hyperventilation, “Rich Men North of Richmond” sounded like a tired rerun.
